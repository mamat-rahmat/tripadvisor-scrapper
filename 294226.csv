","Awarta Made Me Fall in Love With Bali","If you're looking for the ultimate luxury experience in Nusa Dua, then I would definitely recommend a stay at Awarta Luxury Villas & Spa. My villa was equipped with everything I needed and more including: an outdoor living area with a convenient espresso machine/stocked mini bar, a beautiful pool with cascading wall of trickling water, 2 comfortable beach loungers for laying out, a traditional Balinese style outdoor bed for midday naps amongst lush greenery. Then there was the indoor living area...The bedroom and bathroom were out of this world. My favorite feature was the magnificent soaking tub equipped with television and beautiful Balinese decor. The outdoor shower was spectacular and such a treat. I loved being greeted every morning with the sweet fragrance of the enormous plumeria tree directly above the shower. It was true paradise! The wifi was strong throughout the villa and I enjoyed having the iPod dock to charge my iPhone and play music."

","Fantastic Stay With Family","We were looking for a quiet luxury holiday with the kids and the team at Awarta delivered. The villas are fantastic, we stayed at villa #1, and the private pool as perfect. The food was very good, both at the restaurants and when delivered as room service (at the same prices). The staff went out of their way to cater to our requirements, including the kids' allergies and my ""paleo"" diet. Very pleased, would return."

","Perfect for a relaxing vacation (or honeymoon)","Georgeous and huge villas, lovely garden areas and a perfect environment to enjoy a relaxing or romantic vacation. Delicious food is offered in two different restaurants inside the hotel area. There is a professional spa which is offering any treatment you want, and a free gym for guests as well. Everyone in the staff is so friendly, smiling and espescially serviceminded. We felt like King and Queen during the whole holiday and can really recommend this beautiful place for couples that want a quiet and luxurious holiday in a private environment."

","The best hotel to stay and the food is fabulous","If you are looking for a place to relax and escape from the city, then The Awarta luxury villa and spa is by far the most outstanding place go to, whether it's with your friends ,family or as an individual. The facility, sanity and environment in the hotel gives a warm and welcoming atmosphere towards all guests. In addition to that, Awarta's ambiance is filled with luxury and glamour, where their interior is simple but unique. I personally enjoy laying on Awarta's personalised bed where the service provides you with incredibly comfortable pillows. And last but certainly not the least, the food provided strongly satisfies many guests and leaves them longing for more."

","The romantic attainment of peacefulness in Nusa Dua","I was amazed to see a soothing ambience around me. Inside the villa, the one bedroom that we stayed was a real luxury. A stunning swimming pool complete with timber deck welcomed us along the gorgeous teakwood floors. I didn’t know that the sense of tranquility I was experiencing was just the tip of an iceberg. Much more was still to come. With a private pool and spacious outdoor and indoor dining and living areas, I can visualized the romantic moments I was about to experience with my wife. There is nothing as rejuvenating as a romantic time with your loved one."

","Wonderful, wonderful!!!","Stayed 4 days 3 nights, it was amazing!!! The check- in was great, our great Butler "" Angus"" gave us a tour of the hotel before taking us to our room. Our room was great!!! had the outdoor living & dining room with a good size pool, two outdoor showers and one indoors.Bfast had so many choices and restaurants was good! All staffs was great but I must say a special thank you to ""Dixla"" (I think that's how his name was spelled) for looking after us and making our trip a memorable one! Just the one think maybe they need to improve is that given there's only 15-16 villas in the hotel and not full all the time, they should have briefing to all staff which guest is from which villa so that they do not need to ask which Room you in. Will surely be back!!! Oh! the Spa was superb, best in Bali!!!"

","Unforgettable honeymoon in Awarta","My wife and me we spent 10 nights in this wonderful resort where the accommodation, the villa, food and spa treatments were excellent. The pool in the villa and the bathtub were like in our dreams. The staff, professional and friendly, gave us the real feeling of being like in our own luxury house. The complex is new build in a beautiful style. Mr. Resa and all his collegues took care of us with all attentions in a way as we never got before in resorts. Thanks to everybody in Awarta! Thank you for complementary treatments during our stay. Don't miss this experience in BaliPaolo e Nadia"

","Totally fell in love with Awarta!","RESORTI was very impressed how much care and work was put into the smallest corners of the resort. The property was so well taken care of, beautiful flowers and flora in the smallest corners, the villa and the whole resort seemed new and very well taken care of. I loved the candles at night, it created a beautiful romantic ambiance. VILLAThe villa and the pool was amazingly beautiful, very spacious, spotless clean, the bed super comfortable and of course we fell in love with the most beautiful bathtub!  SERVICEThe service was superb, everyone looked after us so well and spoiled us very much. Thanks again to the whole team who made our stay even more special.  SPAThe spa treatments we had were really great, I loved the ambiance, the lady and the massage was very professional, the chair super comfy (I enjoyed the cushion for the legs and the head). Overall a very relaxing and wonderful experience. FOODThe breakfast variety and quality of food was lovely. We enjoyed to choose a whole set (our favourite was the lifestyle breakfast) as well as having the options of taking single plates. The breakfast was very well presented (we loved the beautiful brownish cups and bowls), food was delicious. Lunch/ Dinner at the Long Table was superb and we especially enjoyed the tea time at our villa. Overall, it was a wonderful experience to stay at Awarta and it topped our expectations! We definitely come back!"

","A perfect romantic resort! Too perfect...","The resort is located in a nice secured area in Nusa Dua, an area that looks like is not part of the crowdy and noisy Bali (Ubud, Semninyak, Kuta) and very close to the beach (5 min walk) . This was why we first chose it. The resort itself is absolutely perfect...exotic gardens beautifully designed, big pool in common area, two nice gourmet restaurants with extraordinary food and service, a nice gym and a nice SPA. The villa was spacious, with a gorgeous garden and private pool (water was warm at all times), outside bathtub, outside under the stars shower, outside dining area, full bathroom amenities, free and good quality wifi (inside and outside villa), inside and outside TV's with all types of channels...The service was perfect, with everybody smiling all the times, eager to help with whatever we need and they all did a excellent job in keeping us happy.  Delicious and plenty breakfast in the morning ...that could be taken in the restaurant or at the villa...Two gourmet restaurants with fantastic food and service. What can I say more ? It's quiet, romantic, beautiful, exotic, friendly, relaxing and absolutely intimate resort...the attention to details was extreme....perfect for our honeymoon!  We're definitely going to return soon...!!"

","You will not regret coming here!","This was my second trip to Awarta in 4 months...on arrival it was like being met by old friends...the staff are delightful and accomodating. As before the villa was spacious and luxurious. The private pool and garden are superb. You feel like you are the only guest. If you have the opportunity to stay I cannot recommend Awarta too highly. I will certainly return."

","Most Amazing Villa!","My wife and I came to Bali for our honeymoon and through a recommendation from a friend ended up at Awarta Nusa Dua Villa. We had the experience of our lives! We liked it so much that I want to take time to write them a detailed review!House-Keeping: The Awarta staff was the most welcoming, kind and professional team we have ever experienced. The team makes you feel at home and genuinely cares about you while your are there. From picking us up to the air port to the day we checked out they took such good care of us! Always checking up on us, asking us how our day was, asking if we needed anything, the list goes on and on. Room service was superb. Every night when my wife and I go home, the room was spot clean and they even left us (free) dessert made by the chief every night! My wife and I would joke every night as we would come back to the villa wondering what desserts they left us this time. But more than what they did for us, it was the culture and the experience of the Villa. The culture that they have created among the team is matchless. Food: The best food in all of Bali. They have two different restaurants in the Villa and both restaurants were are favorite places to eat in all of Bali! We visited the Mulia Mulia Resort to try their food because of the online ratings, but we can honestly say Awarta's food had higher quality and better tasting food. The breakfast was complimentary and my wife and I were so surprised at the variety as well as the taste of our complimentary breakfast. If you want, they even bring you your food to your own villa so you can have enjoy a private meal with whoever you came with. The Chinese food there was amazing! My wife and I were hesitant about trying the Chinese food because we didn't want to try Chinese food in Bali but because the Long Table restaurant was so good we decided to try it and we did not regret our decision. They had all sorts of different choices and each dish was so much fun to try. I can go on and on about how good the food was! Spa and Massage: My wife and I were hesitant of getting any treatment at the Spa because there are so many cheap places all around Bali for Spa Treatment. We tried a couple at Bali Collect and when we visited Ubud. However, once we saw the quality of the Spa we told ourselves compared to the price it was a great deal. So we decided to get a body scrub and a full body massage and....it was the best full body massage we both have ever experienced. The Villa: You can tell the owners have created this place for people and families to feel rested and unbothered. We never heard a sound from any other villa and had our own pool! We had multiple showers (two outdoor 1 indoor) and a bath tub. The beds were so spacious and comfortable, the design, look and feel was so luxurious yet retaining a Balinese feel. It was the most amazing room we've ever stayed at. My wife took all the pictures on her phone for the rooms! I wish I had some to show but it was the best! Overall every moment spent at the Villa was amazing!! My wife and I have been talking with one another how we want all of our friends who visit Bali to come to this Villa even if it's only for one night!"

","Best Villas in the WORLD!","My husband and I were referred to this hotel by a friend of ours for our honeymoon. We looked at the pictures and read the reviews for weeks before arriving to Awarta Nusa Dua Villas. Our stay was one week and six nights. It exceeded our expectations in every way possible EVERY single day! The first night we were picked up from the hotel by the wonderful staff. They greeted us with a delicious iced tea and an extensive tour of the villas. Every single staff member that we met greeted us with smiles and genuine concerns about our needs. The facilities (restaurants, spa, common areas) were top notch, clean, and BEAUTIFUL. The scenery, ambiance, and everything about the entire facility was romantic and almost like a dream.We were then taken to our very own villa and WOW...I can't put into words how picturesque and beautiful our villa was. Every villa at Awarta has their very own pool, common area, and sleeping quarters. We were welcomed with a beautiful handwritten note, freshly baked goods, and clean facilities. The bathroom, bed, and common area was beautifully decorated with rose petals in celebration of our honeymoon. We had fresh fruit, ice water, and baked goods delivered to us everyday FREE of charge! Every single day after, we enjoyed the complimentary breakfast, which is AMAZING. They have multiple plates and combinations of food (asian, healthy, continental) that was delicious, fresh, and organic. We never got tired of the breakfast and were excited to try something new everyday. Because the breakfast was so good, we tried the two restaurants at the villas (long table and the chinese restaurant) were amazing as well. The presentation and quality of the dishes served were of the highest quality. Besides the amazing food and amenities, we thoroughly enjoyed the staff at Awarta Villas. They welcomed us everyday with genuine smiles. They gave us advice about how to get around the local area and even asked us everyday if we needed help making arrangements for any activities. They regularly checked with us to see if we were in need of any assistance even when we were back in our villas. Everyday the team cleaned our villa and left a handwritten note and even baked goods, which were DELICIOUS. They basically looked after us as if they were our family. At one point, I lost one of my hair accessories and had one of the staff approach me with the lost item the same day! We even got a massage at the spa and was impressed with their professional, relaxing, and quality services. It was an amazing experience. I am not exaggerating when I say that it was the best massage and body scrub I have received in my life! We enjoyed every single moment at these villas and would do it all over again if we had the chance to :) It is a great place for families, honeymooners, couples, and basically anyone that wants to experience a little bit of paradise on earth!"

","The best, EVER!","The Awarta is an experience. We cancelled our original Bali booking elsewhere (even though we had a non-refundable deposit) as we wanted to end our trip on a real high. My husband opted for the Awarta and what a treat. The welcome, the service, the vila - OMG, the villa was just amazing. We had a one bed, the Orchid Villa (V3) and it was just fabulous. With a large private pool area, 100% seclusion, outdoor bed, outdoor living room and dining room - FOUR showers.... I could just go on and on..... If you want seclusion, excellent service and a memorable relaxing holiday this would be the place for you. It is not directly on the beach however they work with a local beach club and will transport you there any time you request. Breakfast is cooked a la carte and it was definitely the best hotel breakfast I have ever had. Western and Asian delights, beautiful coffee and tea's and fresh, gorgeous juices. Two restaurants have enough choice to keep you full however we did opt for room service most of the time. The villa was just too lovely to ever want to live it. On the last morning the chef came to see us as we had a hiccup with some food previously. He brought us a selection of desserts and an apology. I nearly cried. Everything was just fabulous and any time there was a query or anything that you weren't sure of, they would bend over backwards to make it perfect. Words really can't describe this place. It makes me wish I'd given all the hotels I've stayed in 'average' reviews as this one stands out so much that excellent still doesn't rate it high enough. We will be back. 100% for sure."

","great villa to relax and seclude","Very good, not great. Villa with pool is great with everything you need. Bed a little soft, pillows too hard, even the softest ones we got on request. Restaurants are good, enough choice for a long weekend, not great. Staff are excellent as one gets used to in Bali. Close to airport but no plane noise so if you are not looking for too much action, a very convenient spot"

","Great Stay in Private Villa","I stayed in this property for two nights. It was AMAZING! They have a really friendly staff and good food in each outlets in Awarta Nusa Dua.Their Villa has an amazing luxurious bathroom design with a Natural Concept.

","The Perfect Family Holiday!","It is without hesitation that I recommend a holiday at Awarta. Our villa experience was complete luxury from start to finish. Travelling pregnant and with an active 2 year old, finding accommodation that suits can be tricky. But life at Awarta was extravagant and suited our relaxation, fun, freedom and safety needs. The villas are huge - plenty of room for our little family and the friends we brought along. The layout allows adults to enjoy the outdoors and the private lounge without disturbing little ones napping or sleeping early. Each villa was private we never HEARD another guest, let alone saw them! The staff were incredibly accommodating of our energetic little guy and went over and above to meet his picky eating habits and wild ways. Both my husband and I enjoyed the spa and the facial (caviar) was undoubtedly one of the best I've ever received! Nothing was too hard for the Awarta team, their transportation options made life easy, walking across to the beach was a short 5 minute jaunt on manicured pathways and Nusa Dua is the perfect choice for families looking for a safe, quiet, slow paced holiday. We took advantage of a few day trips to Ubud, Seminyak and Uluwatu (all arranged by the Awarta staff), but we were always happy to come home to our beautiful Villa. Cannot wait to go back!"

","Amazing luxury","I'm currently at the Awarta Villas in Nusa Dua, sadly it's our last day here as we fly out late tonight. The moment we arrived here we have been spoilt in every way imaginable. The foot spa treatment we received as soon as we arrived into the villa was a nice touch. The villa is simply amazing, we are in the 2 bedroom villa (10) it's very well appointed with everything you need. The pool in very large and surrounded by beautiful gardens. The breakfast is to die for. I can't thank the staff enough, always very helpful and always alway pleasant. In short one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. We'll be back for sure."

","DREAMY DAYS","I don't even know how to begin to explain how awesome this hotel is, by far one of the best places I've ever been. I travelled with a group of friends, as soon as we got to the airport we had a shuttle from the hotel waiting for us, and at the hotel a welcome drink (mojito) and a foot massage that got us in to the mood of Bali! They divide the rooms by villas, so is almost having your own little house inside the hotel (private pool / dinning room). They have 2 restaurants inside the hotel, one is international/western food and the other one is chinese, both really really good! I can't forget to mention about how kind and solicitous the staff is, they are always smiling and wanting to make sure you are having the best time! I would highly recommend this place and definitely will come back again."

","Paradise found!","Went with my husband and 2 children. Stayed for 3 nights. Hotel made us feel at home. Extremely like the peacefulness within the hotel. The room is very clean, I walk bare footed all the time, bed is like a magnet, too comfortable that you never feel like leaving the bed. Although there are only 2 restaurants, the food is fantastic and price is affordable. Service is tip top, we went out for dinner on 1 night and went back hotel late, staff were worried about us and one staff came out and search for us. A hotel you will never regret staying!"

","Excellent (...with a small ?)","Spent 4 nights in a 1 bedroom villa in early June. Firstly the positives and there are many. The pick up from the airport was seemless despite it being complicated by the fact that 2 of my travelling companions were not staying at the resort but only coming for dinner. The reception at the resort was exemplary and welcoming. The villa itself cannot be faulted. Immaculate, luxurious comes to mind. A large private pool, superb outdoor bath and shower. Without question amongst the finest of its type. The staff are extremely friendly, helpful and accomodating. Now to the only downside...the food is not the best...breakfast was included at that was absolutely fine. We had dinner the first evening at Ru Yi, the Chinese restaurant..it was good but without being anything exceptional. The biggest issue was room service...my guests came back the following day to spend time before flying out in the evening to Europe...we ordered lunch and frankly it was terrible...the food was stone cold when it arrived and was sent back...the replacement was marginally better. Over the next few days I resorted to ordering my food well done in the hope that it would be warm when it arrived and that only just worked!... however please do not let that retract from the fact that Awarta is a luxurious and stylish resort which I would have no hesitation visiting again."

","One of the best stays in Nusa Dua","I have just returned from our stay at Awarta and I must say I have never regretted one moment choosing this place.First of all the villa is beautiful with up-to-date amenities. The pool was big enough for my son to play in and the hot tub was decadent. The surrounding is serene and beautiful too. The free breakfast served every morning is sumptuous and decadent. We never got tired of the food there. Ruyi restaurant which served chinese food is authentic and delicious.Awarta is just about 20 to 30 minutes from the airport which I feel is very convenient. Bali Collection which is the main hub for shops and restaurants is about a 15 minute leisurely walk but you can always ask the villa to send you there via their transport and pick you up after you are done. Very convenient. It is also a 10 minute walk to the beach. We had an adventure trying to look for the route, it is a narrow path between Club Med and Sofitel (so now you know). We felt very safe during our entire stay. Awarta takes care in ensuring their guests safety. In fact the whole of Nusa Dua feels calm and serene as opposed to the busy Kuta.I think what made this stay extra special are the amazing staff they have. Resa, Made, Bayu, Ayu and countless others (I'm so sorry if we forgot your names) took time to get to know us and make us feel truly welcomed. They went out of their way to personalize our trip and make everyday and enjoyable one for us."

","Bali's Best","After we had arrived at the airport in Depasar we were picked up by the hotel's shuttle service and welcomed very kindly with a drink in the beautifully appointed lobby. In fact, every part of the hotel impresses by its unique furniture and decoration, especially the grand-sized villas that allow for highest comfort in every aspect - including not only your personal outdoor swimming pool.And there is really nothing that Awarta cannot offer when it comes to relaxation and dining!A great selection of traditional Indonesian as well as international massages leaves no wish unsatisfied and the same holds for the two restaurants within the resort offering the best dishes from local, Chinese and international cuisine.I enjoyed everything about my stay at Awarta, strongly recommend it to everyone else and fervently hope that I will get the chance to come back again!"

Another thing have to mention is the food in the resort, no matter the Chinese food, western food or Indonesian food, all is beyond good. I have all dinners in the resort and all is much better than my expectation!

When I arrived, the weather was very nice there in Bali, the sky was clear, the view was stunning but i felt even more amaze when I arrive at Awarta, this place is just so cozy and beautiful. Awatra doesn't feels like a resort, it's felt like home for me. The atmosphere here is very warm and I especially love the garden and the pool, they were very well maintained. The food also very delicious and the service in the restaurant is also excellent. The entire staff were truly some of the kindest and most wonderful people i had met throughout my holiday."

","The Best Kept Secret in Bali","I have been vacationing regularly in Bali for over 20 years and had the unexpected pleasure of staying recently at Awarta Nusa Dua. It by far has exceeded any resort that I have ever stayed at over the last 20 years. I prefer staying in Nusa Dua for obvious reasons. The location of Awarta is perfect as it is much more private than the other resorts in the Nusa Dua area. The accommodations are immaculate and the staff and service is unmatched to any other property in Bali, They also have a private beach club and complimentary transportation in luxury coaches. The on site restaurants offer some of the best food choices available, and even of the restaurants is open 24hrs. I think the staff at Awarta make the experience extra special. All of them go above and beyond with any needs that you may have. The entire experience was a 6 star experience and I look forward to returning to Bali and especially to the Awarta Nusa Dua."

Awarta is truly a hidden Jem in Nusa Dua. The private beachclub with a large grass area is the perfect place to relax and access the water sports of Benoa.

","Flawless and lingering vacation","As a working couple, we really crave and enjoy a relaxing vacation together. We were so much welcomed from the beginning of our arrival at Awarta till the last day of our stay there. The one-bedroom villa which we stayed in is outstandingly equipped and taken care of and we hardly found any flaw in its facilities. Everything we enjoyed in the compound just made us reluctant to go out, but to indulge ourselves more there, especially in the restaurants and the spa. Coming back there is for sure,,,"

","The Best There is!","Awarta is not just an ordinary getaway place, it was meant for something more. A place where kindness was its priority and bringing joy and happiness to all its customers. As i stayed in awarta villas with my friends for 4 days, it was the most memorable time i could ever asked for in Bali. There maybe alot of other villas in Nusa Dua , but i can assure that Awarta is like no other. When the motto comes, customers comes first , they treated us like we are the president or somewhat very important person. Things come and go but the memories and joy that awarta villa has given me will always stay with me. A 5 star place providing luxurious foods and the best services you could ever imagine on Bali. Its heaven on earth. If you dont believe me please render yourself to enjoy a pleasant stay in Awarta."

","Hidden paradise","We stayed at Awarta for 2 nights, looking for some serenity and we were not disappointed. The resort is so peaceful despite a large number of villas, you don’t even hear any noise from you villa. The villa we stayed in was spacious and comfy, well decorated with authentic Chinese arts but nothing kitschy. We ‘ve been happily surprised by the size of our pool and the lushly garden so well maintained.On our 2nd day we indulge ourselves at the spa, in a one of the private room for 2, with a ”Pot Garam” treatment (hot pot filled with sea salt and spices) that has been a great relaxing moment. The staff was very professional, whispering during the treatment, giving just enough information without bothering us. And all in a perfect English! The music surrounding was at the perfect volume and the lighting dimmed perfectly. We loved the spa interior too, which calm you down as soon as you get in.The food at the Chinese restaurant was good enough, very traditional but could, maybe, be a bit more creative. The Shanghai 1930’s décor is spot on, with once again beautiful handicraft. The service was attentive, smiley staff with decent menu knowledge. A good value for money.If you are looking to be totally disconnected from your busy life, this is the place to be!"

","True Paradise","My stay at Awarta was simply amazing. My friends and I stayed at the three bedroom villa with a living room (and a small kitchen) and had our own pool. The room maintenance is excellent, they check and tidied our room a number of times during the day. The room service is also really great, there are vast delicious meals.The staffs are all very friendly and polite. We are given excellent accommodations. There is also a spa in the resort that adds on to the great relaxing experience. I really couldn’t add more to all the positive reviews already present because they are all true.Overall, it was a fantastic experience. The point of our visit was to relax and have crazy fun and we earned way more than that. I really couldn’t have asked for a better retreat."

","By far, the greatest","When we reached the place i could not but help to say wow all the time, the people there are so friendly and helpful and the place looks and is amazing. We were welcomed by fresh delicious drinks and cold towels, just the thing you need to beat the Bali heat. On our way to the villa was a path of great greenery and it looked like it is really well groomed and taken care of. The villa i stayed in is simply wonderful, we got a nice swimming pool and a front row seat to get a nice tan, or at night, to see the beautiful stars of Bali and in the inside the beds and the pillows are like heaven. The cleanliness of this place is sublime, every time i leave the villa , i always come back to see my dirty laundry that are on the floor ,tidied and neatly folded on my bed and the whole villa was like new again every time we came back. The services is one of the best as well, anything you need at anytime will be satisfied by them with a smile all the time and it did not take much time, everything is done so quickly and professionally. Culinary? Check! The food there was also one of the highlights of my Bali trip,I highly recommend the Asian food, i never liked vegetables until i ate the food they made there which are also presented in an exquisite way, instagram worthy.So far this place never fails to amuse me, i must say it is the best place to stay in Bali, it is worth all the spend there, its like heaven and there is no other place you'd rather be. No exaggeration."

","Amazing Experience","When you stay in a villa in bali, you are not renting a room just to sleep for a night. A villa is not a place, it is an experience. Awarta villas approves my definition of a villa. not only they provide luxurious spacious rooms with complete, thoughtful facilities and compliments, they gave me a complete experience.from the moment you reach, when the polite staff greets you and brings you to your room. to when you are eating brunch at the long table restaurant (restaurant inside the villa) you get to enjoy the relaxing atmosphere not every place has to offer. If you're looking for a peaceful and serene holiday getaway, Awarta villas is the place to go."

","Post Graduate Holiday Splurge","So, being a student that has just graduated, my stay at Awarta was extremely needed to unwind with all of the final projects and finals completed! They picked me up from the airport in an extremely nice car and it was there that I met Eva, who would be my butler for the duration of my stay. She carries herself in a way that communicates all that Awarta stands for. Calm, relaxed, professional, and very prompt. Anything that was required, was met with haste and always taken care of with a smile. During my week, I had Mr. Yasin as my personal driver. For my day trips, Eva organised so many places to see in Ubud, Uluwatu, and evenings in Kuta. The food... oh the food!!! You will be able to experience the rich heritage of Chinese Indonesian in the traditional Chinese Restaurant, or a little bit of anything and everything in the Long Table. If you are after a refreshing time of quite, you have everything you would need in your vila, and quick room service is only a call away. The fountain in the pool is so relaxing if you are wanting to spend time laying out or just sitting poolside. This has been the best Holiday, with the most friendly staff, in the best luxury in Bali!Enjoy, and make sure to try the waffles with breakfast!"

","Best for honeymoon!","We stayed there for 3 nights for our honeymoon. Our villa no. 6 is a lovely spacious villa, it has a private pool, a bungalow beside the main building and an outdoor bath area at backyard. Banquet is 24 hours, has varieties of food such as indonesian (balinese, manado), western, chinese. Breakfast was superb! made by order and pastry were delicious. Our favorite entree was woku chicken and thumbs up for their dessert chocolate meringue cake with orange sorbet, we highly recommend you to try both of them. SPA was awesome, so relaxing!Staffs were friendly, quick responses, they helped us with flight check in and everything we need during our stay. One of the staff asked my husband if we wanted to go to the beach, they happened to manage a cooperation with a private beach in nusa dua just 5 mins away by car. We went there, it was serene. If you love shopping there's a mall called Bali Collection just 5 mins away by foot.After all the villa was luxurious yet it worth every penny. We heard that each villa has different interior layout, so that the returning guests would experience different feeling from their first stay, we enjoyed our first stay and we absolutely wanna go back to try their other villas. Thank you Awarta for making our honeymoon memorable!"

","Hidden gem in Nusa Dua","Awarta Nusa Dua Luxury Villas and Spa is nestled in BTDC complex, it's truly a hidden gem in Nusa Dua area where you will find numbers of convention-sized 5-star hotels within the area. Awarta consists of different types of villas, all private! with pool yeah! I tried the one-bedroom villa which its spaciousness is just suitable for me or I think for a couple will also be a perfect fit. The bed is super huge and comfortable. Moreover, there's a big pool in front of the bed-room and the rest of the facilities : living rooms areas, out-door seating, small garden is well spread out within the villa compound itself. I also like the giant bathtub standing sexily within the outdoor bathroom area. See the photo.Foods: I had lunch at the Long Table where there are mixed of international and local dishes. I tried Nasi Goreng which is always my favorite and whenever I am in Bali I will order this dish to make sure that foods will always taste nice when you go local ;) As you can see from the photo, the portion is big and the quality of the foods is very good. Oh coffee here is pretty nice as well. Ask for iced cappuccino.Spa: This is a must! to try if you stay here.When I arrived, the spa receptionist asked me what type of massage I preferred. I just told her that I had very tension back and shoulder cos I worked in front of computer most of the time. I just wanted something relaxed yet released the muscle tension. So the receptionist suggested me 'Nuad Pra Kob' a Thai Compressed massage. I was hesitated at the beginning cos it sounded like I'm gonna burn my back /shoulder but I did try. I got male therapist who is very professional and explained to me what was included in the compress bun (I called it like this) and how it would help me. It was hot at the beginning but after a while the body got used to the heat and the therapist also massaged me at the same time. It's indeed relaxing. After I finished the therapy, I felt my body was very light and the tension at my back disappeared. (Happy face) Talking about the price, it's very reasonable. I live in Singapore where the cost to have such a nice massage like this will be over US$200 for 1.5 hours but at Spa Cenvaree, for this program costs less than US$100. Compared with the reliable massage, service and clean facilities, it's worth trying.There are a couple of 2-3-bedroom villas that can accommodate 2-3 families which I think next time I should try if I travel here with friends/ family."

","Lifetime experience","Dear Tripadvisor readers!We stayed at the 2 bedroom villa for 2 nights. We were a family of 5 so we had to have an extra-bed. A private pool and sperate living room was the highlight of our stay.  We were there to celebrate the 20th anniversary of my parents. It all started with staff of Centara Grand receiving us from the aiport with chrysler (super cool car). Since this resort is quite new and still under construction everything was so classy and beautiful. When we entered this resort it was a dream come true. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The most important and royal feeling came when we went for a massage at the spa section. The owners of Centara Grand Nusa Dua are very very nice people and made sure that we were comfortable througout our stay. We ate at both restaurants: chinese and long table. The Scotthish chef at long table is really a chef who cooks authentically. We loved our stay there. We look forward to be there already this year! Thank you so much for having us and letting us to become a part of an exotic experience :)"

","Paradise in Bali","I had a four day break on a recent business trip to Asia-Pacfic, and could not have picked a better spot to spend it than Centara Grand Villas Nusa Dua. Still in ""soft opening"", I was able to book a one-bedroom villa for an incredible deal (book now while you can still get this!). There are 64 suites being constructed on the property, but at no point did I hear any construction noise in my private villa or in the resort amenities. From the moment I arrived at the Denpasar airport, every moment of the next 4 days was pure pleasure. I was greeted by hotel staff at the airport and whisked away in a brand new luxury van to the resort property, where check-in was quick and easy. Rendy, who met me at the airport and assisted with check-in, showed me to my villa and after a quick foot massage and scrub, showed me the around and explained the villa. Even the wifi was good!I took a short video tour of the villa, you can find it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inJG2q6eZZQI took some time in the spa and found it was world-class and very well priced. I had a 90 minute massage, which was bumped up to 105 minutes thanks to a 15-minute massage gift-certificate I received at check-in. The facilities were excellent and the quality of my treatment was as well. I ate at both the restaurants, Long Table and Ru Yi (Chinese) and both were excellent. The ""spa"" menu for lunch at Long Table was especially a treat with the Lobster and Watermelon dish that I came back for the next day as well. Service at both restaurants was impeccable. The resort manager and food & beverage manager came over to introduce themselves and check in on my stay multiple times. Twice I went to the beach club affiliated with the resort. It's worth noting that the hotel does not have its own beach-front property, but is a member of an amazing beachfront club located a couple of km away. The staff was happy to arrange transportation to and from the beach and the staff of the club also offered the highest level of service. The food in the restaurant on-site was also amazing. Just bring your visa card, they don't take american express and you cannot bill to your resort folio at Centara. It should also be noted that this club can be reserved for private events (receptions, weddings, etc) and it is closed to Centara guests at those times, which are usually late afternoon or evening so minimal impact as your skin will already be tanned from the Bali sun. I cannot say enough abut the quality of service and friendliness of the staff. Each of the staff knew my name and greeted me whenever I saw them. I was genuinely sad to say goodbye at the end of the trip. A big ""suksma"" to the entire team at CGND. I would recommend this resort to anyone and would not hesitate to stay there again."

The kids had a blast with the cascading pool water feature and the outdoor bathtub.

Location is perfect if peace and quiet is your ultimate desire. You can still easily still go to different parts of Bali even if you are in this gated area. Massage was absolutely divine.

Nice little touches like remembering your name and your favourite drinks. Lovely staff overall! And don't let me start on the SPA. I can safely say I am a bit of a massage junkie and love to go anytime, and they did not disappoint me. I had two 90 minute treatments and everything is thought of. You even have to fill in a card beforehand where you would like them to pay attention to and what areas to ignore. It's the small touches that makes for a great 5 star resort. The Villa was incredibly clean! The pillows were to die for.. not to mention the romantic bathtub.. The food was really good as well as the service in both restaurants. We had Chinese food one night and after living in China for two years, I can easily say this was as authentic as it could be! I really recommend this place..

","Great stay!","We went to Centara Grand Nusa Dua for a weekend with a couple of friends and it was WOW. The villa was an attraction in itself. My favourite parts were the really cool pool, the outside bathtub and shower and the super comfy bed. If it wasn't was for the other cool facilities worth trying, we wouldnt have left it for the whole stay :D Buuuut when I went to the Spa Cenvaree, I felt like I travelled to a different planet. The Balinese massage, quiet atmosphere and friendly staff just gave me an incredible dose of relaxation - just MUST do it when u'r there. Another must I would recommend is all the pastas at the Long Table restaurant (and the cool concept of the long, wooden table itself - especially useful for a dinner with friends). Oh and the fresh, real, delicious bread - sth really rarely experienced in Bali. To sum up, if you look for a quiet, private and relaxing stay - totally go for it!"

","Masterpiece of Customer Service","They have the best property, interiors, location and rooms but all of this is humanly possible. But what is not possible is to give a delightful experience with consistency. In all management schools there is research done and highly debated topic that should we delight our customers and this leads to various questions that will we able to match the raised customer expectations every time? Can we bring in consistency in delivery of delightful experience? and many more. Viceroy is an answer to all the questions as raised. That yes it is possible to delight the customer with the same consistency as McDonalds give the same burger across the world. I thank Viceroy staff to give me a memorable experience of life."

","Breathtaking Experience","When we first arrived at the Viceroy in Bali we were absolutely speechless. It was nothing less than absolute perfection. We were greeting with a fresh flower lay and the most delicious welcome drink made of fresh oranges and tropical fruits. We were so happy to find that not only did CasCades restaurant understand my gluten-free allergy, but they had an entire menu of gluten-free options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. While eating at Cascades we experienced the most amazing food while overlooking thousands of trees and wild monkeys jumping from branch to branch. We loved CasCades so much that we ate breakfast, lunch, and dinner everyday there during our stay. It just wasn't worth us adventuring out for another location to eat because we knew we couldn't beat the amazing food and view. In the mornings CasCades offers a complimentary breakfast starting at 7am, we all enjoyed avocado toast and jam, pancakes with chocolate sauce, and fresh fruit with granola. At night, we watched traditional Balinese dancers dance while eating dinner. It was something we have never experienced before! We were even able to come up and join the dancers while they taught us some local moves!When we first walked into our room it felt like we had our own private villa overlooking the jungle and we were miles away from everyone. It was the most luxurious room with such a peaceful feel. We had our own private pool and hut which made us really feel like we were in Bali! One morning we ordered breakfast to the room and ate our pancakes, fruit and eggs in our hut by the pool, it was amazing! Next to CasCades is the pool that can be sued by all guests. It is an infinity pool that makes you feel like you could swim straight up into the jungles tree's. We received pool-side service and were able to order food and drinks by the pool hut. We spent some time at the Lembah Spa and had the most lovely mani and pedi ever! The ladies that serviced us were so sweet and kind and really took there time with us. We got complimentary ginger ice tea's and a foot and hand massage before the mani-pedi. The spa overlooks the entire jungle which makes it that much more relaxing to be looking out into nature while receiving your spa treatment. After our treatment we ended the day in the Lembah jacoozi with was surrounded by beautiful marble tiles.Another perk of the viceroy was their library. There, we were able to grab any movie. They had such a wide selection of comedies, dramas, romance and more! It was located just under the lobby so it was very accessible. And not to mention, we had a flat screen TV in our room to enjoy these great films on!Viceroy was by the far the most beautiful hotel I have ever been in, the entire terrace is green with fresh grass, plants and flowers. If the luxury of the hotel doesn't make you want to stay forever, then the staff most definitely will! We received such amazing service in the room and out. The staff wen out of their way to make sure we were well taken care of. I can truly say we have a sense of family at the Viceroy."

(*It is walkable to Ubud centre in about 20 minutes, but why walk when you can get driven! ;)We stayed in a garden pool villa which was stunning - an absolutely huge comfy bed (bigger than a super king!) in a massive room with living room area, TV, coffee machine etc. Then outside of the main room was a wrap around area with plunge pool, stand alone bath, amazing shower, and a couple of different day beds with views of the forrest. The villa was equipped with everything you could need in terms of toiletries, fresh drinking water and amenities, restocked twice daily as needed. The cleaning staff kept the room consistently spotless throughout our stay. The pool area at the top (infinity pool) was even better than the photographs you will have seen - we spent every morning sitting on the sun beds gazing across the pool and into the forrest below. It was just breathtakingly beautiful. The restaurant and bar also overlook the pool and valley/forrest. I would recommend watching sunset with a cocktail at the bar - the cocktails are fantastic, and the view even better!The included breakfast was the best i have ever had in any hotel. There are appetiser, starter and main/hot options extensive enough that each morning we had to give the menu a good 20 minute review before ordering! Everything we ordered during our stay was excellent. We also ate at Cascades restaurant one night for the balinese dancing show. I would really recommend booking to do this - it was great fun and the food was absolutely excellent - i have eaten at quite a few michellin starred restaurants and it wouldn't surprise me if this place gets a star soon. The only negative i have of this resort (and it's up to you if you see it as a deal breaker or not) is that they allow children. When booking, based on the images, exclusivity and romantic angle this hotel portrays I did not expect it to be a family friendly hotel - i expected adult-focused luxury. This is obviously mainly my fault in not researching it properly. There were quite a few babies/toddlers staying when we were there and quite a lot of screaming/tantruming could be heard when walking around the resort. I think it's such a shame because it's such a tranquil location and everything feels very adult-focused. As i said - it's up to you if you see this as a problem or not - I'm sure a lot of people wont. Overall, i think this resort is amazing and the owner and staff here should be very proud of what they have created, and i would recommend booking to stay here for a few nights if you're travelling in Bali."

","Absolutely Paradise","We recently stayed 3 nights at the Viceroy and my only complaint was that the stay was not longer. I had seen photos and was extremely excited to stay there. The property itself does not disappoint. Without a doubt the main pool is one of the most magnificent sights I've seen. We took full advantage and even used the swim up bar which was also excellent. We stayed in a Terrace Villa. I admit that I thought the pool might be a little larger and I am curious as to what the next level of room might have looked like. We were at the highest level so it would have been interesting to see how much more you get if your room is lower and therefore closer to the edge of the canyon. Needless to say, our view was still stunning. Cascades, the restaurant, was excellent dining. The breakfasts, which were free, were top notch and a great deal. Anything on the menu was available for no extra charge which was a great touch given that the options were endless. We had two dinners there, both of which were some of the finest meals we had while in Ubud. We took advantage of the free shuttle service into town which stops at two very convenient locations. All in all, I would not stay anywhere else if we returned to Ubud. Though it's not a cheap place to stay, the Viceroy is truly in a very magnificent location with impeccable facilities and views."

","Ridiculously good","The owners have gone to extremes to create their luxury masterpiece, The Viceroy Bali. The staff went out of their way to make you feel great about yourself service impeccable. I feel like Michael Mcintyre here 'the fish sacrificed themselves on your plate' but seriously from the time you arrived you were in heaven, pity we didn't spend more time about the hotel I am pretty active other than that the stay was seriously great! Views were special, you could not build this place anywhere else in the world it was truly magnificent. Other hotels will come and go, the Viceroy will stand the test of time!"

","Stunning","If you're reading Tripadvisor (as I guess most people will be) to scope the possible accommodation for a forthcoming trip then stop because you've found it. Wow, what a place, location, service, views, weather, I might just have stayed at about the nicest hotel I've ever been to. And I've been to a few.Fantastic pools, both the resort pool (picture of the view included) and the private villa pool (with monkeys from the adjoining forest in attendance), splendid cocktail bar, excellent staff, fantastic luxury, great restaurant, lovely Ubud close by. Mrs G enjoyed the spa too. You're probably getting the idea. Great, great place."

","Gorgeous luxury villas in Ubud","The perfect place for a romantic getaway in Ubud. It's a quiet spot in Ubud and whilst it's something like 5 minutes from the city centre, it's completely peaceful at Viceroy as you're surrounded by endless forest. The villas here are a beautiful escape from every day life. We stayed in a pool villa which had a beautiful infinity pool (1.3m deep) and our own private bale (perfect for having breakfast in-room). There are also sun loungers too. Inside the villa is extremely spacious with a large bathroom and bedroom / lounge area & separate wardrobe.The staff here are full of humour! Extremely attentive and 5 star. Whilst it's all about your own villa pool here, the grounds also have a large infinity pool right next to the restaurant too. I travelled with my sister however would say this place would be perfect for a honeymoon or romantic getaway."

","Honeymoon in Bali","The Viceroy in Ubud is an amazing hotel! I was there for my honeymoon and everything was perfect beyond compare... From the amazing views to the staff which are so friendly! One thing we really loved was their collection of dvds we could borrow to watch in the room as you are quote far from the major city. If going to viceroy make sure you do a lot of activities as you are quite close to some of the major attractions Bali has to offer such as the monkey forest and the rice paddies. Also if you do plan to spend time shopping in Bali i reccomend the bali collection as they are quite cheap for decent souviners and you dont need to bargain to much like at some of the vendors around ubud. But all in all our experience was amazing! Thank you all at Viceroy especially our good friend Eddi who worked at the restaurant!"

","THE VICEROY BALI- A MAGNIFICENT PIECE OF HEAVEN!","My husband and I are fortunate to travel to many places world wide but never have we experienced such magnificence and luxury. 24 stunning private villas all with their own private infinity pool and day bed overlooking the forest are just 2 of the villa's assets that captured me from the 1st moment! The grounds are pristine, the pool sparkling, the food served looks like something out of a magazine, the service us unlike any other we have experienced- from the moment we were picked up at the airport and greeted with a fragrant cold hand and face towel, a freezing cold bottle of water, friendly driver, a warm friendly welcome on arrival at The Viceroy along with a scrumptious cocktail and frangipani flower lei. The staff and service is superb! The owners Mr Otto, Mr Anthony and family have created an absolute piece of heaven and it is no wonder they are a Multi Award Winning Boutique Resort. Congratulations on creating such an incredible Resort- You deserve all the success and accolades that you continue to receive. If there was a 15 Star rating I would give it to The Viceroy. Thank you to all staff and management for a beautiful unforgettable stay."

","Exeptionel experience","With its delicately furnished and decorated villas, looking over a lush jungle landscape, the Viceroy is a perfect resort for relaxed holidays in the middle of the island. The small terrace pools add an extra convenience: refreshment after getting up in the morning or before going to bed at night.Breakfast is à la carte and leaves nothing to wish for: Taste the Eggs Florentine or the Mango Trifle, we found them both delicious.The restaurant is probably one of the best in Bali, whether you want an European style dinner or Indonesian specialities.We hired one if the hotel cars and a driver and were shown to all the places we Limes to discover.The Viceroy is a 5 Star resort that lives up to every single one of its stars."

","Unsurpassed five-star experience","If I only had one night to spend in Bali then the Viceroy would be it. I'd waste no time and splurge on a helicopter to whisk me from the airport to my private villa complete with a bale perched on the edge of the gorge and plunge pool trickling into infinity; which no doubt the fine dining restaurant CasCades is inspired by, or maybe its the other way around. The chess board table was a nice touch too. It was almost a shame to close my eyes in such sumptuous surrounds even while I was being spoiled at the Lembah day spa. Next time I'm going to try one of their sky tours. Some promise a five-star experience, but the Viceroy delivers in abundance."

If you're looking for beautiful bucolic scenery and sweeping green landscapes, this is the place for you. My partner and I came here for a nice relaxing lunch. We stayed for a number of hours to enjoy the pool and converse a bit with the staff. I saw several amazing reviews and beautiful photos on tripadvisor, so when we toured ubud we were very eager to make a stop over and check it out. Well worth the trip."

","Amazing place!","From the moment we were collected at the airport by Chess until we were taken back 6 days later the warmth and efficiency of all members of staff was superb.The Viceroy really is a little bit of heaven! We stayed in Vice Regal 2 and enjoyed complete privacy in our garden and delightful pool. We only used the infinity pool once as our own pool was plenty big enough. There is a very varied choice for breakfast and even a separate gluten free menu.The gym is perfectly adequate.We both enjoyed massages at the spa, professionally performed.CasCades restaurant menu is very varied and beautifully prepared and once again, they have a gluten free menu. The wine is incredibly expensive but this is the case all over Indonesia.The Viceroy offers a free shuttle service into Ubud and they were happy to recommend restaurants and make reservations for us. Nothing was too much trouble! When we returned we were greeted with 'welcome home' and that is just how we felt, at home.Everyone should be able to stay at The Viceroy once in their lives! I hope one day I will be able to return."

","Extremely Over rated!!!Left disappointed and HOT!!","My husband and myself because booked this hotel after reading all the amazing reviews!But we were left thoroughly disappointed..Definitely NOT a 5 star hotel..I wish we had read the bad reviews so we were more aware of what to expect!Although the staff are extremely polite and hospitable this hotel is is more like a 3-4 star masquerading as a 5 star!!Also please be aware the AIR CONDITIONING DOES NOT WORK..Our room stayed at a warm 26 degrees all night..If you have been to Bali you will know that with the extreme humidity you need working air conditioning..We booked for 4 nights but left after 1..Yes we lost money but we didn't want to waste 3 more days with no sleep.Also the food is limited..And if like us you want to experience the local cuisine this place will disappoint you too.Breakfast was nice and the service was very warm.The gym is smelly and not great.The room is spacious but had a stale water smell.And as mentioned aircon didn't work.We booked the deluxe terrace villa which did have a nice view and beautiful plunge pool.If you are looking for seclusion perhaps try the Ritz..In hindsight we wish we had booked that!Will not be back!!"

","Incredible experience in every possible way!","This was a wonderful hotel in every possible way. Service was impeccable -where all of the employees get their training, I'm not sure -it's 100x better than what I've ever experienced! Everyone you see, walking to and from your villa, in the restaurant, anywhere -greets you with a friendly smile and a hello, in most instances, using your name (Hello Mrs. Struebel!) Food was phenomenal. We ate here for most of our meals. Breakfast was hands down our favorite! Order anything and everything on the menu -it's the best you'll ever have!!!!!Lots to do! Being our first destination on our honeymoon, it was lovely to just recover from the 25 hours of flying by resting peacefully by the pool with my Kindle for the first day. We ventured into town and even as far away as Agung, via a motorbike we rented from Viceroy for ~$10/day. It was so new, had less than 100km on it! Absolute BEST way to explore the area! (Beware of locals as you venture further from town...sometimes it can get a little sketchy, perhaps more so in the country. Cleanliness is above and beyond anything you may expect. Very few insects/critters. Just those adorable little salamanders that come out at nighttime (try to keep your doors closed to your bedroom, lest they all creep in under cover of night! ...even if they do, no biggie! I'm squirmish about all things creepy-crawly but these little guys didn't bother me at all -they are completely harmless!) Everything about the villas were perfect and clean -water bottles were replaced daily (more often if you use them!), bed was made elegantly, turndown service was wonderful!We put a ton of time into deciding where to stay in Ubud and knew we wanted top notch -let me save you the trouble! Stay at Viceroy Bali!!! You won't regret it."

Having lunch poolside beside the infinity pool was great, I would recommend the wraps & burgers along with their fresh cut fries!This was the perfect stay and we will definitely be visiting again. If you are looking to splurge and enjoy the finer things in life, this would be the place to do that. Thank you for making my first trip to Ubud a memorable one."

","Top quality","My boyfriend and I stayed here for 5 nights on a 'splurge' holiday treat. We got upgraded from a terrace villa to a deluxe terrace villa. Everything was luxury and really really nice. The breakfast was a definite highlight for us- order anything you like off the menu as complimentary- MUST TRY THE FRENCH TOAST!! The only issue with staying at a high end place is the cost of everything else. We only used the spa once as it was just toooo expensive. I would have used it every day if it was cheaper. An idea would be to give all residents a voucher for discount spa use. Maybe a '50% off all treatments for one day of your stay' or something. Overall a 10/10 for quality and general experience."

","A little bit of heaven !","We arrived at the Viceroy after 3 days at the St Regis in Nusa Dua. It was a bit of a contrast. Cool as compared to Nusa Dua and being a small hotel the Manager came to greet us and was there to tell us that we had been upgraded to a villa with a pool. Nice touch given the less than 30 room hotel. Even though St Regis only has 30% occupancy and I am a SPG member they did not bother to upgrade us. Viceroy has a free shuttle to Ubud which is 10 mins away not quite walking distance. The spa and massage treatments as well as the dinners were all half the price of the St Regis. The staff is very friendly and courteous not unlike the St Regis. The one negative is that since the rooms are built on a hillside there is a lot of walking up and down to the Restaraunt and lobby which is a great workout if you are up to it. The villa was very well laid out with one big large room which includes a bedroom a expansive bathroom and the living area with a TV. The patio outside has a small pool"

","AMAZING HOTEL EXPERIENCE!!","We stayed at the Viceroy in Ubud for 3 nights for our Honeymoon, and wish we had book it for longer! From the moment you arrive at the Viceroy there is a calm, a serenity, a peacefulness I have never known through all my travels before. The service is impeccable, the accommodations are fabulous and the food at the restaurant is great. I will forever hold all other 5 star hotels to the standard set by the Viceroy. We chose a Garden Villa and were super impressed with the room size, structure and of course indoor pool! I can't tell you how magical it was to wake up to the sunrising over the jungle every morning. It was great to be able to swim (sans suit) whenever you wanted without having to be in the sun if your skin needed a break. We chose the main pool for laying out and enjoying the jungle views. We had villa 6 and highly recommend due to it's proximity to the restaurant and bar and it's view in November of the sunrises. The staff were all fantastic. I have never known service like in Bali before. The included breakfast was awesome, best we had all our trip. We ate at Cascades for dinner one night and it was worth every penny! One of the best meals of our trip. Tid bits to help you make your decision: -AC in the room was excellent (compared to the other two hotels we stayed in during our honeymoon and trust me, a good working AC is very important in Bali!) -The hotel shuttle takes you right into town in Ubud. We found this very convenient - The hotel is located close to all the main attractions people might do in Ubud (Elephant Safari Park, Monkey Forest, massages and warungs in town, etc.) -This seems like an odd one to mention, but I did not receive one mosquito bite while staying here. I noticed them spraying one day and am appreciative now for it because our second hotel definitely was not that proactive and I ended up with about a dozen bites our first night at the second hotel. :( At the Viceroy, our room was inclosed from the rest of the open suite and indoor pool and we didn't even need the mosquito net. -Spa- yes it is expensive since you can get massages in town for about $15 USD, however it is an experience! I have paid double at spas in the states and not received the treatment I did at Lembah spa. I would recommend to throw this in the mix if you are doing several massages over your holiday. We just love this hotel and all of the staff! I can't recommend it enough. We can not wait to come back, and make it a longer stay next time! "

The breakfasts were amazing and we did the special couples dinner at the poolside which we would highly recommend for honeymooners.Nothing was too much for the staff they were all so friendly and helpful. We did the tour bike ride with the hotel, couples massage in the room, yoga. It was all amazing. So relaxing and our villa was incredible. Thank you so much.

","Just Perfect...","I booked the Viceroy based on the reveiws on trip advisor and even though I had read about how lovely it was , it surpassed all expectations.THE PEOPLEWhat makes this establishment shine is the staff and more importantly the owner and his family. We had the pleasure , as I am sure most visitors have, of being personally greeted by Otto, a charming man who built the Viceroy and loves to chat with his guests. You cantell this resort is run with love. Otto loves Bali and the Balanese life- it shows! The staff were all wonderful, friendly and sincere.THE VILLAWow, wow wow! We had a terrace villa with the most luxurious , huge bed and a bathroom to die for. Beautiful stone fllors and walls, qual;ity finishes. Not a bit of wear and tear to be seen. Our own private swimming pool overlooking the dense forrest - peaceful and beautiful . We didn't want to leave the room. A buggy will come and get you as the land is steep, and take you where ever you need to go.CASCADESBreakfast was amazing and not a buffet in sight- order from the menu! Every dish we tried was done to perfection. The degustation Dinner was spectacular. We couldn't get through it all...but tried hard to as it was delicious and of fine dining quality. Wines are expensive but that is normal for Bali. The veiw from the restaurant is just perfectTHE SPAWe had a massage each and pedicures. The pedicure was alfresco overlooking the valley and a nice breese was welcoming on a very warm Bali day. The treatments were very good. THE DRIVERSWE went on a little tour one morning and our driver( cannot recall his name now) was lovely and we visited the rice terraces and the coffee plantation- nothing was a problem. Overall the hotel is worth every cent. We ( my daughter and I) were there to relax and Viceroy was perfect. Honeeymooners- this is the right place for you. UBUD a short drive away and the car will take you there when you need to go and pick you up when you are ready. Lots of nice restaurants in town and things to do- but we didn't do too much as we had plans to just relax. Do yourself a favour a book the Viceroy- you will not be disappointed."

","Majestic, tranquil, world-class service!","My wife and I had the pleasure of concluding our honeymoon with a 5 night stay at the Viceroy Bali. I’ve stayed at a lot of great establishments throughout the world, and I have to say this is probably the best lodging experience I’ve ever had. The Viceroy, was first class. Everything on the hotel grounds from the lobby to the pool was so elegant, clean and welcoming. We stayed in the Viceroy Villa, which was appropriately nicknamed the “King’s Suite” and was absolutely incredible! The space was massive, we had two bedrooms that were both incredibly large and had bathrooms attached that were both exquisitely unique. The outdoor area of our villa was pretty incredible as well. Every morning we would step outside the bedroom door and stand in awe of the breathtaking views of the jungle landscape. We felt like we were literally lost in paradise. We also had a giant private pool, large grassy ‘backyard’ with a cabana, lawn chairs and to top it all off a large comfy couch in between the two bedrooms with a big screen TV and decked out sound system (which both bedrooms had as well). Astonishingly, even with such an amazing property, the most impressive part of staying at the Viceroy was the service and the staff. The staff was so kind and so professional at all times. Their mission clearly was to make sure we had the best possible experience and they did not fail! Our interaction with the staff began the minute we arrived in Sanur on the ferry from Lombok. We arranged for a pick-up and we were fortunate to have ‘Chess’ come meet us right at the actual drop off point of the ferry.. in the sand! Then on our 45 minute drive to the hotel, Chess gave us some really insightful information about the Bali and specifically Ubud culture. We also coordinated a private tour with Chess in which he took us throughout the Ubud and surrounding areas that included an elephant ride, a tour of the Luwok coffee plantation, the rice terraces and the Holy Water Temple. That was easily one of the best days of our 3 week vacation.In addition to all that, the restaurant in the Viceroy called Cascades was incredible, we had dinner the first night and breakfast every day that was absolutely delicious. Words cannot properly express how amazing this experience was for us, but I can say that if you are planning on staying in Ubud, you must check out the Viceroy Bali!"

","Mystic Morning","Stayed for one night and no doubt that the property is nice. It’s a perfect place for those who are in their honeymoon. A private pool at your doorstep, a big bathtub that can spoil you with the warm water before you go to bed, and the mystic morning view through the hills in front of your room. It was one of the best stay I ever had in a hotel. I know you have right to wake up late when you’re on your holiday, but make sure you wake up at 6 to see the mystic morning view and the sunrise. After that you can go back to sleep :)"

","The perfect spot to unwind and recharge","Everything about Viceroy Bali is perfection. During my weekend break in Bali, I stayed in a Deluxe Terrace Villa. The villa was amazing - private heated pool, cabana (locally known bale), sun loungers, spacious bedroom and bathroom. But what sets Viceroy apart from the other places I've stayed at in Ubud is the quality of service and the attention to details of all staff members. I'm very active, and I tend to pack a lot of activities in my itinerary so it's hard for me to just relax and not do anything. I was able to do that in Viceroy, and needless to say, I left Bali completely recharged. Other highlights include the 2-hour spa at Lembah Spa and the dinner at Cascade Restaurant."

The staff is very friendly and helpful and the food at the hotels restaurant is pretty good as well. The only problem I had with the hotel was the bugs, bee's and moths were sort of rampant and for me that was a huge problem, but I realize thats not a negative of this hotel so It doesn't affect my rating or my suggestion for people to stay there. I do think its important to let people know though that if your afraid of large insects Bali may not be the place for you to visit. If you do decide to visit though, this is the place to stay."

The staff are wonderful and nothing is ever too much! There is waiter served a la carte breakfast which is delicious! The rooms are stunning and luxurious! Perfect hospitality from each and every member of staff! There is a shuttle service (free hotel taxi) into Ubud dropping at two different points depending on where you want to go! (They can advise which point you will need) The restaurant meals are incredible and there is a large variety, drinks are also great, I would urge you to also get out and see the culture in Ubud and go on excursions. We did a hotel half day excursion with Margi - he is the perfect tour guide and very knowledgable! Everyone we encountered made it a fantastic experience. All in all this has been a wonderful holiday, we are well travelled but the Viceroy exceeded all expectations!"

","Paradise in a jungle and a pool in my room!?","Is there anything bad about the Viceroy? I ask you fellow trip advisors? From the golf cart service to the delicious dinner, this place never failed to serve up first class service and relaxation. The Viceroy is a nice little hideaway amidst the tourist hustle and bustle. Each room comes with a pool of your own! They also do little things, the manager gave us a free bottle of wine just...because...because Bali I guess. They have bikes you can use and a free shuttle to town which is pretty available. A ride to the hotel from Ubud will cost 100K at the most. There's a little library and a small gym. I couldn't work out though. I was too busy eating nasi goreng and drinking cocktails at the swim up bar. The Viceroy is worth it - if you can afford the high price tagPros: Amazing viewFantastic servicedelicious dinner (try the crazy deserts)Swim up bar!Pool in your roomCons:Expensive (but worth it)"

","Perfect honeymoon ","From the moment me and my wife left the airport to get on to the pick-up service provided by Viceroy we were in total relaxation mode. The driver had perfect hospitality skills even greeted us with cold bottles of water and cold face towels which were definitely appreciated after a long 18 hour flight. on arrival at the hotel we were again greeted with cold wet towels while all necessary paper work was done and then escorted to the bar for welcome drinks. the views where so amazing two weeks later I'm still mesmerised by the pictures we took.The room was beautiful, spacious and clean, room service visited twice a day and always did a great job, the hotel service desk where always helpful even recommending and reserving us tables at local restaurants we wanted to visit.The food at the restaurant was 5 star complimented by the amazing jungle view, I always looked forward to breakfast and the fresh juice every morning. The Australian Black Angus Steak I had for dinner was by far one of the best I’ve had.The spa was also really enjoyable always making sure that we were comfortable and relaxed.All in all the week was perfect so perfect we have actually fallen in love with the place so much that my wife was nearly in tears when leaving.Thank you Viceroy for making our honeymoon perfect and a special thanks to Tari for going out her way to make us feel special."

","Amazing last stop on our honeymoon","Upon arrival we were greeted like every where else in Bali, welcome drink, flowers and a hot towel. After a brief chat about the reason for our stay they upgraded us to the Deluxe Terrace Villa. The staff was amazing, truly out did themselves in every way possible. We were only there for two nights and the stuff remembered our names. Nonetheless, its a very small resort totaling 25 villas, very quiet. On our last night we walked into our villa to find a rose petal bath waiting for us.Viceroy truly goes above and beyond to satisfy all their customers.The free breakfast was Al Carte which was nice and made every breakfast that much more luxurious. However, that is their only restuarant on the premises. Have no fear they offer free shuttle bus service to the town until 10:00pm. Our room, was amazing, our private pool however, was just a little warm for us considering the hot weather in Bali. We still embraced it and enjoyed our time in the pool.This is the place to honeymoon, relax and rejuvenate."

","Stop looking- book the viceroy","Really, save yourself some hassle and research, take it from seasoned luxury travelers who have samples a plethora of five star hotels in Bali... The viceroy cannot be beat, best staff and really fun rooms. The rooms are really REALLY special. Food is good, BUT so many options are available to you in uBud you don't actually have to eat at the hotel every meal. However there pizza was fantastic there steaks were great and again service blew us away... We dined at mosaic and others yet no one beat the attentiveness humor and just general awesomeness of The head waitress joy. Yann the hotel manager gave us some excellent suggestions for places to eat outside the hotel that were so tailored to our needs and our dynamic we were again blown away. I can't express how it feels to have a hotel manager just take he time to find out what you want and give you fantastic and organic tailored itinerary that did not involve Us a spending a single dime at the hotel. He just wanted us to enjoy our day! Which in turn made us so comfortable that we did in fact end up spending loads of time there and did spend a lot of money there as well. It's just win win situation for all concerned! thank you guys so much ! Spent the best two nights of our holiday with you and we will be back."

","Lovely short break","Stayed for three nights in their new Deluxe Terrace Villa. Everything was wonderful.Highlights:Heated Infinity swimming pool in room with gondolaChess on the balcony patioBreakfastStaff/WaitersThe free shuttle into townThe treatments in the spa, whilst being expensive relative to the rest of Ubud, are still pretty reasonable. My wife and I had 3 hour couples treatment and together that cost £250 which is not bad at all when comparing to other places we have travelled to. My only complaints were that the A/C in the room seemed to not be strong enough (but they soon fixed it when I rang) and there werent enough hangers in the room (and we had to ask!). These are very minor indeed but I hope management takes them on board and just ensures this is taken care of.This is a family owned hotel and for an independent business and for a hotel of this calibre to be performing as it is, that is quite admirable. The food is seriously good, however, I felt you could get better VFM outside the hotel at Bridges or other eateries for the value we paid at dinner at Cascades.My wife loved the hotel and had wanted to go for 3 years - she was not disappointed at all!"

Our room was spacious and well designed, we had a private pool overlooking a lush green valley, and the beds are so big and comfortable you could get lost! The hotel is owned by a family who we met during our stay, they were very hospitable and have created a delightful boutique experience that is truly unbeatable. We had a delicious French inspired lunch with wine matching at the hotel's restaurant, CasCades. Excellent food and service. We'll be back!"

","Surely the best in Bali","I have never written a written a hotel review before. And its certainly not my thing. But I thought that I would be doing you a disservice If I did not comment on my recent stay because this place must surely be the best in Bali. I have been to Bali a number of times and stayed in a lot of luxurious and expensive places, including some of the top places in Ubud. But this place sets the standard. It is great value for money and you are (seriously) hard pressed to find anything wrong with it! It is arguably impossible. I struggled to wipe the smile off my face the whole time I was there. I am reluctant to describe my time to you in detail because its best left as a surprise. But what I can say is that it is an entire experience. Everything is geared towards that idyllic escapism that so many of us seek in a luxury holiday. From the moment you are greeted at the hotel with a smile and frangipanis, to your first impressions when you see the incredible villa (believe me, its worth the surprise!), to the moment you find yourself on your own beautiful spotless white day bed near the pool looking out over an unbeatable view wondering if life can get any better. The service matches the experience. And I know what you're thinking - the Balinese are all so friendly and it is a high standard in all places!? Think again. It was certainly a notch above what I have previously experienced. There is no job or question too big or too small. It was also great because it was relatively small and family owned. They manage to strike the balance between being personal and attentive, while at the same time giving you space to get away from it all. Although that is admittedly easy in the gigantic villa!I have no doubt that I will be back. P.S. It would be remiss of me not to recommend a massage. You will no regret it."

","Luxury and tranquility at it's Bali best!!","I hesitated writing this to keep Viceroy Bali and CasCades (restaurant) as my private luxury escape. I have after all been there twice now in less than six months!!! My home away from home, or so I tell myself. The friendly staff and atmosphere radiate the family owned aspect of this incredibly classy 5 star resort. It's stunning views, the tranquility of area, the private pools in each villa, an attention to detail that would make every accountant jealous and the food menu is definitely from the business end of delicious. The place has a unique feel to it that despite being at capacity you feel like you're on you're on own with minimal interactions with other guests and when it happens it's often over the three course breakfast or a cocktail or two. Ohhhh I just realised I forgot to do the helicopter tour... Guess I'll have to go back (again)!! There are some things in life just too good not to share. Viceroy Bali is definitely one of them."

","We will be back (although not soon enough)","The Viceroy Bali provided my partner and I with one of the most genuinely pampering holidays of my generally quite pampered life. Clearly the spectacular location is a given but my partner and I were also astounded at the sheer attention to detail evident throughout the resort. The private pools and sunbeds, the four-poster beds, the beautiful copper basins, the water feature(!) in the Viceroy Villa bathroom, the hand making the peace symbol as a towel rack; I loved it. It feels like a lot of heart has gone into making the Viceroy an incredibly special place.I could not recommend it more."

","Absolute Tranquility","From the moment you pull into The Viceroy, you know you've landed some place special. The grand entrance states that this place means business. You are impressed from the moment you get there, until the moment you leave. No detail is spared. Upon my arrival, I was warmly greeted by staff, offered a cool towel and drink, and given some flowers to put around my neck which smelled lovely. I was checked in quickly, and brought to my room within minutes. I stayed in the 2 bedroom villa which completely blew me away, I felt like royalty. The rooms were very romantic, clean, air-con was already pumping. I couldn't wait for my stay at The Viceroy. I had lunch and dinner at Cascades, and the food was absolutely phenomenal, definitely several notches up from the food in town. I would rate higher than a 5 star if there was a tab for it. My villa was stunning in every way, and it felt extremely private, although I was on a resort. The pool was breathtaking, water cascading into the jungle, my massage at the spa was perfect in every way, the views just blow you away. This is for sure the REAL 5 star experience in Bali. I will absolutely be back!"

","Incomprehensible","The only shame about this place is that photos can't capture how truly great it was. It is all the small touches that show such attention to detail that make this place the greatest i have ever been to.I am not sure how this was achieved but the thing i struggled to explain to people once home was how your villa could be so open out into the world with a beautiful pool and the beautiful views but at the same time be completely private and your own.The food is world class standard, the drinks are amazing (and can be served whilst swimming in the pool if your heart desires) and all this is located in what feels like remote forest but is only a short ride to the center of Ubud (although i must admit this place was so great i didn't go in that much).You can feel the care that the family owners put in to make sure your stay is exactly the way you want it to be. It is not often you see that kind personal attention to detail and can only be achieved by a boutique hotels such as this one. Much love to all the family and staff there for something i will never forget (may have to update the memory yearly though....)"

","The most amazing hotel I've ever been in","The Viceroy really is on a different level to normal hotels, and it's almost not fair that other places are allowed to call themselves 5 stars. I can't remember being more impressed at any other resort/hotel/boutique accommodation.The room had everything I needed including a decent toothbrush. The bed was the biggest i've ever seen - i think it's a Super king and it allowed me to lie across it widthways (no mean feat given I'm 6'5""). The private pool was pretty special and in our room it was an infinity pool like the main one. it did tend to warm up in the bali heat, but that's just the nature of the sun.The breakfast menu is simply amazing, they've absolutely mastered portion size so that you can try a couple of things. French toast is by far the best I have ever had - I just regret not ordering bacon on the side (though honestly it didn't need it, I just missed an opportunity to eat bacon). The staff were friendly and attentive, and I've never before received a hand signed letter from the owner welcoming me to the hotel. I had a chat with him (Otto) at the bar and he was warm and genuine.I would guess that a lot of thought has gone into the little things that really tip the scales to exceptional service. They have really thought of everything.I came here just after a honeymoon trip to Fiji and regret not just just spending the whole time here.I cannot wait to go back. You will not regret staying here."

","WOW... The most incredible honeymoon resort!","My husband and I just spent our honeymoon at the Viceroy. It was jaw-droppingly amazing from start to finish. Upon arriving, friendly staff brought us a refreshing welcome drink, and then took us over to our room - a Deluxe Terrace Villa. I've stayed in hotels around the world - but nothing compares to this. A super-king bed, gorgeous (and huge) bathroom, our own private infinity pool with a gazebo and deck chairs, and an incredible view out over the gorge. We had both breakfast and lunch in CasCades, the in-house restaurant - no ordinary hotel dining experience! My husband ordered the French toast (and I ate most of it), and we then had Bali Benedict eggs for main course (a two course breakfast!!). The staff are incredible - nothing is too much trouble. My only regret is that we didn't stay longer...but we will definitely be back!!"

The staff at the Viceroy went out of their way to make our stay with them everything we could have imagined. We stayed here for a week on our two week holiday in Bali and it more than exceeded our expectations. The second week was at the Four Seasons in Jimbaran Bay and as lovely at that was, we missed the Viceroy. This is one of the the best and most relaxing hotels we have visited.

","Couldn't be better. probably the best in Ubud","Ubud was the first part of our trip to Bali. We planned this for our 25th anniversary, and looked for real honeymoon hotels during our stay.We had a great start of our trip!When we arrived, we were immediately presented with a free upgrade to a deluxe terrace pool villa. The check-in was very fluent, relax and very friendly.Our room was.. big, the terrace with the view was completely what we expected and hoped for. The shower was enormous with a 30cm rainshower! that's real luxury after a 25h trip.We have been to Asia on several locations, and everywhere the people are very friendly. But in Viceroy, the people were not only very friendly and helpful but they gave the impression they genuinly liked their jobs and to have you as a guest.The swimming pool is as heavenly as in the pictures. Even the loungers were godly.The Cascades restaurant was a pleasant surprise too: very nice food and beautifully presented by their Belgian chef Nic.We had a most wonderful 5 day stay in Viceroy and couldn't recommend a hotel more as this one!

","Honeymoon in the jungle","My husband and I visited this hotel for our honeymoon, it was our second hotel as part of a 3 stop itinerary. From the moment we entered the viceroy we could tell we had picked a really special hotel. The staff were very friendly and attentive. The grounds looked immaculate and the infinity pool overlooking the rain forest was amazing! We stayed in a garden villa and we loved this room, it was huge and quirky with the plunge pool and outside/ inside bathroom. The restaurant did great food, it is quite pricey but very enjoyable. As it was our honeymoon the hotel gave us some freebies including a cake, some flowers, a petal bath, a 2 hour couple spa treatment and a romantic dinner. The spa treatment was really good, we had a massage, a body scrub and used the facilities. The romantic dinner was brilliant, we thought it might be from a cheaper menu but lobster was included in the 8 courses we were given. The hotel is set in the jungle on a steep hill, so for those with a fear or creepy crawlies it might not suit you, we had gecko's on the ceiling most nights and we saw a snake outside our room. The hill wasn't an issue as the hotel has golf buggies which you can call on if you need them. The hotel is close to ubud and you can use the hotel shuttle to get to and from the town. It is close to monkey forest, the padi fields and some temples so perfectly situated for doing some sight seeing. Overall we loved this hotel, it made our honeymoon better than we could have imagined and we would definitely want to return one day. "

It's gorgeous!Upon arrival we were upgrades to a deluxe terrace villa on the lowest level, which provided us an unobstructed views of the coconut forest and jungle. The room was so spacious and comfortable.The pool area is beautiful!! However, be aware of some guests who go to the pool area first thing in the morning and ""book"" the best loungers for when they come back in the afternoon - was not super happy about that, but, that is of no fault to the hotel.The car service is amazing, and we would definitely recommend guests booking the private tours through the hotel, as our guide ""Gama"" was truly amazing when he took us through to Kintamini Volcano and he even took us to places not listed on the tour. He was kind enough to walk with us through all the places and describe in detail what was happening, even taking our pictures for us. First class service!The CasCades restaurant is lovely, albeit, pricey, but the dinner is amazing and they always provide you with littel extra amuse bouches and delicious bread, so in my opinion worth it.Beautiful hotel, and as I mentioned before, a dream come true to stay at a place like this for our honeymoon!

","Undoubtedly the best place to stay in Ubud, Bali","Viceroy Bali is a blissful sanctuary of romance, peace and tranquility. If you're a couple seeking an ideal hotel for a romantic getaway, these are just a few of the reasons why you will LOVE Viceroy Bali.1. The location is perfect for couples seeking privacy in a romantic setting in a perfectly sized villa that offers a view of Ubud's lush, gorgeous greenery and Ubud's Petanu river while being close enough to the daytime adventure and nighttime liveliness of Ubud Village. Viceroy Bali is the only place that offers a helicopter pad if you're looking for a breathtaking view of Ubud's renowned rice fields and a grand helicopter entrance from the only airport in Bali, the Ngurah Rai International Airport (1.5 hr drive {with traffic} from hotel, 15 min helicopter ride).2. The service was beyond outstanding. The staff was friendly, hospitable and quick to provide you everything and anything you need. We also loved the private transportation the hotel provides to and from your desired destinations. The concierge is quick to give you recommendations on the best dining, day and nighttime experiences and adventures in Ubud. A+ on this category!3. The amenities were divine. My partner and I stayed for two nights in a private terrace villa suite before trekking to our next Bali destination, Uluwatu! Comfort was king in our villa - from the plush, king-sized bed, private heated infinity pool and grand bathroom and centrally situated bathtub - every intricate detail in our villa was executed to perfection. We were very pleased.Now to the subtle cons:It appears that the Cascades Restaurant is an award-winning dining experience revered for its exquisite fusion of European and Asian inspired palate-pleasing dishes. We had a light dinner here one night and found the apps to be delightful but slightly underwhelming. The breakfast, while satisfactory, was slightly disappointing in flavor (i.e. bacon was well over-cooked and eggs served cold). Overall the food was good, but my expectations were much higher given all the accolades of the restaurant. The gym in the hotel was clean and provided all the essentials for a decent workout, however, the gym amenities and equipment were slightly dated. Not a significant con but a minor observation.Overall, a huge thank you to the incredible staff at Viceroy Bali. We enjoyed and LOVED every second of our stay at the hotel and will be coming back again the next time we visit Ubud!"

","Honeymoon ","This is the spot!Everything is of luxury. Suited for couples. Suites overlooking the valley full of trees gives a sense of being in the middle of the jungle with all the luxuries one can ask for. Ubud central is very close and the hotel had a shuttle service (7 seater) which will drop you off to one of 2 central points. They can pick you up. We did kindly ask a restaurant we ate in to call the hotel, we weren't waiting long. We did agree one day to be picked up at a certain time but this can be restrictive, depending on what you are doing.The hotel pool is amazing. Hardly any other people around. The room pool is small to swim but nice to chill. Massive shower...for 2 even.Ask the hotel staff for anything...they were happy to accommodate our every request.Good choice of breakfast.One evening we had a honeymoon meal in the restaurant. 9 small courses...lovely and filling.Perfect honeymoon spot."

I went there with my friends, but I can tell that it's perfect if you want to spend honeymoon and private time there. It gives you a serenity feeling.It combines a traditional Bali ambience with a touch of modern interior as wellThough it's quite far from the city center, but Viceroy provides with the villa’s private car if you need to go outside around Ubud.

And all this set in the middle of paradise.The villas are absolutely massive, and each have their own pool - bigger than just a plunge pool, but not a full swimming pool - and breathtaking views into the jungle. Because of the brilliant design of the rooms, each has an open balcony or pool with a view out to the jungle. It is incredible.The service was absolutely faultless.The food was superb: from a la carte breakfasts, through to evening cocktails and exquisite tasting menus at night time, we loved the food here.We thoroughly recommend this, especially for a honeymoon. You won't regret staying a the Viceroy!"

","Perfect honeymoon hotel ","My husband and I celebrated our honeymoon in Bali and visited four different locations. The Viceroy was by far the best hotel out of the four from every perspective; staff, location, rooms, restaurant, atmosphere and tranquility. Upon arrival we were presented with royalty treatment. We received a free upgrade and we were blown away by the room and the rest of the hotel. The room consisted of an extremely large and comfortable bed, an excellent mini bar, beautiful terrace with private sun loungers and an infinity pool which overlooked a beautiful valley. We were always treated to a chocolate on our pillow and even a rose bath was run for us on our last night. The location is perfect, Ubud is great to experience true Bali culture. The hotel provides a free private car to the centre of Ubud for when you need it and they can arrange to pick you up to prevent any taxi fees. The staff all seem genuinely interested in you and have a clear passion about providing you with the best possible experience. The restaurant served the best food by far throughout our whole stay in Bali. Albeit it is more expensive then the local restaurants, the menu and quality of the food is 10 out of 10. The view from the restaurant provides a very romantic setting. We were also treated to a complimentary candle lit dinner which was perfect.Overall we had an outstanding stay and we will definitely be going back."

","Exceptional Setting, Great Hotel. Thanks","This was the second of our tri hotel visit to Bali. The first was amazing so this had some living up to do. I'll begin by talking about the setting, it truly was as good as the pictures depict, All the Villas are set into a valley in the forests of Ubud so it does feel like you are living in a luxury retreat in the middle of a jungle.Our Villa was spacious and well appointed with a B&W music dock as well as well as a good quality coffee makers, DVD player and large television. The highlight of this room again however was the outdoors, we had a lovely infinity pool that was heated throughout the day as well as a Gazeebo overlooking the valley (a great spot for anyone who wants to read!)Breakfast was al la carte and had a good selection (especially the bakery items i.e. warm croissants and cinnamon swirls) again with a wonderful view might I add. The Cas-Cades resaurant was pleasing, the tasting menu provided many regional dishes with freshly sourced produce.The staff as expected were welcoming and attentive, this hotel is about a 10 minute drive from the centre of Ubud but the hotel does have a shuttle service whereby you will get a private transfer in one of their cars to the town centre. Another plus point is that wifi is available throughout the resort and not only in the rooms.Brilliant Hotel, Many Thanks"

","The best bit of Bali","We stayed at Viceroy Bali for 3 nights in villa Regal-2. I must say the service was the best we experienced in Indonesia. The staff was unobtrusive, helpful and pleasant. The hotel was a lot smaller, cozy and romantic compared to the other top Bali hotels that we stayed in. The food was top notch given the quantity of chefs that they hire. We were also very lucky to be able to attend the first night of Nick Bril’s tasting dinner experience, and it was the highlight of our trip to Bali both because of the quality of the food and the company. We also never got to thank Anthony for the end of dinner drinks and arranging the heated pool for the afternoon, so we thank you now. The hotel well deserves all the accolades and awards it has earned so far and I am sure there will be plenty more in the future."

","Quiet,cool, Green and Lush views. Its about the small things.","The hotel is lovely, especially the private pools in the morning, though there could have been a little bit more sun coming on to the pool area. The sunrises in front of the private pools, so when the sun sets its best to go to the main pool. It is windy this time of year and cooler in ubud, which allows you to dress up a little.Small details I noticed about the hotel which i appdreciate, each villa has umbrellas incase of rain, and the staff are well trained. when they see you taking photos they always ask if they can help. Found out a lot of staff have been there for the beginning 10 years ago! Says a lot about the owners!Property is immaculately maintained for 10 years old! Breakfasts are phenomenal and play a big part, order the coconut french toast, amazing. The rooms were clean and spacious, especially the bed and there are surprisingly no mosquitos, except at night, so be sure to close your doors.We emailed our trip plans which was mixed up a few times and I believe more than one person handles the emails so it gets a little confusing re-explaining to another person, so clear it up in person. There was a misunderstanding with our sunrise tour, which we were not informed it started at 230am,it was booked as a rice padi tour, which they said we had to book for another morning if we weren't going that day, though we didn't book for it. No biggie.Don't forget to change money outside of the hotel because they do not change dollars anymore, as a ruling in Bali.We went river rafting which was awesome but its for 2 hours and the hardest part was probably going back up the cliff side, be prepared! The staff were lovely. Its a honeymoon hotel, for couples and it lives up to its name though slightly ever so pricey.The massages were average, the only let down. The massage rooms would have been better to be grander and more spa looking."

","The best hotel we have ever stayed in!!!","My husband and I recently returned from a 5 night stay at this hotel for our honeymoon and we are so glad we chose Viceroy! The surroundings are stunning, the rooms are amazing and the staff are incredible. They cannot do enough to help you and are so friendly and warm. Our airline lost our bags on our flight over and the reception staff consistently rang the airport for us and kept us updated to help us get our luggage back.The food at this hotel is outstanding, including the breakfast which is included. As we were on our honeymoon we were also treated to a romantic candlelit dinner for two, which is just one of the many special touches this hotel gives you (with there only being 25 rooms in the whole hotel).This is the ideal hotel to stay in for honeymooners as it's private, romantic and beautiful.I think it will be very difficult to find a hotel as special as this one anytime soon but we will remember Viceroy for ever!"

","Very private heaven ","The hotel is a small hotel , but one of best in Ubod . The service is outstanding , rooms are so clean . They clean the rooms several times a day , I wondered at times how can they be that fast , as I go out of the room a bit and come to see the beds fixed :) we took deluxe room as it was the only one available and they were so helpful that they added 3 extra beds for my 3 kids (everyone got a bed ) so we ended up with our huge bed alone , and that made our stay more comfortable . Many complains here that the private pool was cold well that was not our case as we requested a heated pool from the start and it was so warm and my kids enjoyed it day and night . 2 mornings of our stay we had to go out of the hotel so early , and they were soooooo nice to prepare food boxes for us , every member of the family got a pastry box and a fruit box . That was amazing touch from them and made our mornings with kids much easier . The cascades restaurant is so yummy whether for fancy dinner or just for breakfast . This hotel is an amazing getaway and hidden gem ."

","Paradise","We had a 10 day holiday for our family, ourselves and 2 daughters aged 19 and 21, and everybody would be unaminous in staying our stay was like "" finding a little piece of Paradise"". We had originally booked for 5 nights and to stay in the Viceroy Villa. On arrival we immediately felt relaxed with our welcome, even after over 19 hours journey. The villa was perfect for our family and gave the privacy necessary with our daughters, but also plenty of room ad beautiful a garden, pool and communal area for us to all be together. The service of all the staff was exemplarary and the food delicious. We had several exam results to celebrate on holiday and each time the restaurant made it a special occasion. We were due to move to another area for the next 5 days and the Viceroy chauffeur provided us with a very informative trip. However as soon as we arrived at the other hotel we all realised that their accomodation & standards just couldn't compare and so within 22 hours we were back in the car and returning for a further 5 nights at the Viceroy. We were welcomed back by everybody we spoke to, as your personal care is a priority of the Viceroy, and Otto ( the owner) and his family are present daily to greet visitors ad ensure your needs are met to the highest standard. This time we stayed in two adjoining deluxe terrace villas, again with beautiful views of the forest ( and monkeys) and accomodation. I cannot recommend the Viceroy highly enough for location, accomodation and standards. Their high standards did not even end with our visit as my daughter left some bikinis in her room and they were kindly returned to us in the uk. Only tiny point to say is- on some nights we had families with young children next door, who were quite boisterous in the pool and would spoil the tranquility for some coulpes, especially honeymooners- so maybe request a room away from young families- in fact I think they may have been next door to us because we were a family- just with 2 grown up daughters & not little ones. It didn't bother us but as this is a review thought it worth mentioning to ensure the Viceroy is perfect for you too."

","I want to go back!","We stayed at the Viceroy Ubud, in Feb15 for my birthday, and I can’t say enough nice things about this resort. Despite the long flight from the UK, the Viceroy Bali is definitely one of the most beautiful luxury resorts that I have ever seen and the staff are exceptional! The Viceroy is settled in the middle of rice fields and palm trees! It is not in the heart of Ubud ""downtown"" (but you honestly don't want to stay ""downtown"" if you're looking for relaxation & beautiful views), but it is close (5 minutes) and the resort offers a free hotel shuttle, well actually its a chauffeur driven car. In Ubud there are lots of shopping opportunities, temples and places to eat. The food at the hotel restaurant ‘Cascades’ is fantastic and the cooks are ready to prepare anything else you might fancy that is not on the menu. There are only a few villas, and the terrace villas are huge, sparkling clean, and well-appointed. You can relax in the shade of your terrace and from the private pool look over at the jungle where you can sometimes see a troop of monkeys. You can even walk or run along the rice fields (do this early morning or its too hot) or use the well equipped gym. In the evenings have a pre dinner drink looking over the valley as the sun sets. I actually visited the spa for a couples treatment (not something I normally do) and it as awesome. From the reception desk to the restaurant to the spa, everyone is genuinely kind, friendly, and professional. A special mention to Mr. Agung for the disco lighting on my birthday treat and for fixing me up after my bike incident! Bali was great fun, and the Viceroy made our stay spectacular, and by the end of our holiday felt like family. It is a very special place.If you are considering spending some nights in Ubud, just stay here.It isn't the cheapest but to be honest. This is an expensive resort, but as mentioned here they do prove the long standing relation between price and quality!"

","Wow! Incredibly beautiful resort with excellent staff!","We stayed at (3) hotels in Bali - Viceroy (Ubud), Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa (Seminyak) & Ritz Carlton (Nusa Dua). The Viceroy was the BEST overall experience! The resort is stunning and the staff is EXCEPTIONAL!! (they helped us with lots of planning / booking of activities in advance of our stay & easily made recommendations / bookings for us while we were there - even coordinating a birthday surprise for my husband). The location is not in the heart of Ubud ""downtown"" (but you honestly don't want to stay ""downtown"" if you're looking for relaxation & beautiful views), but it is close by (5 minutes) and made very easily accessible with the free hotel shuttle; the shuttle drivers are also great - they had plenty of stories to share which brought us lots of entertainment / laughs & they taught us a few extra things about Bali culture! The food (the free breakfast as well as snacks & dinner) at Cascades was some of the best we had while in Bali. The only thing that I would note is that the bathroom for the Garden Villa is outside (still within the privacy of your villa compound) and the plunge pool is in the shade so it's a bit cold. I would recommend one of the other villas instead, but definitely should stay at this amazing resort!"

","Stunning","My husband and I recently stayed at the Viceroy Ubud, and I can’t say enough nice things about this resort. It is exactly the kind of place I seek out when looking for a hotel. There are only a few villas, so it is always quiet and calm. The villas are huge, sparkling clean, and well-appointed. The private pool overlooking the jungle (you can see monkeys playing in the trees if you look closely) was exquisite. The grounds are immaculate and gorgeous. The location is not far from downtown Ubud (which was great fun to explore). The breakfast was amazing – we were never disappointed with the food – in fact, of the four destinations on our trip, the food here was overall the best. But the best thing about the hotel was the staff. Maybe it’s the Balinese people in general, but the staff at the Viceroy were exceptional. From the reception desk to the restaurant to the spa, everyone is genuinely kind, friendly, and professional. Bali was great fun, and the Viceroy made our stay spectacular.

","A very high class resort that delivers on its promise","My wife and I spent 4 nights at this hotel at the very end of July. My wife loved it! One should expect a very high quality when staying at a place like this and - YES, the Vice Roy did deliver! We had a terasse Villa that was spotless. Service very discrete and friendly. The Villa came with a private pool and a cosy, small outdoor ""hut"" filled with pillows where one could relax in a bit of shade. The sun would hit our private terrasse until around 1 PM, a bit of shade in the afternoon was perfectly ok. The main pool next to the restaurant has sun longer if that is wanted. Check-in and check-out was flawless and a complimentary late check-out matching our departure and flight time was granted without hesitation.

","Superior and luxurious","Where to start, there are so many positive things to say about Viceroy Bali. Lets start with the first impression, after a long travel - arriving at the hotel You are accomodated fast and with precision, installed in Your ""villa / room"" and this is a experience many hotels could learn from. The front desk is extrem in the skills and smiles as well, so friendly and capable of making You feel special and unique. We stayed in a villa and this is a recommendation, You have absolutly everything at hand and in luxurious frames. The hotel in general is wow and the view like nothing You have never seen before, beauty everywhere You look. Food and drinks served at the restaurant is marvellous and splendid... All in all Viceroy should have Seven STARS, they deserve it... Unique, amazing, splendid, excellent, wonderfull and romantic as well... This is what vacation and travelling is all about... Do not cheat Yourself from visitting Viceroy once in Your life, this is guaranteed a life experience... Bon voyage to all travellers who love luxury... Home is where the heart is, part of my heart is still at Bali and in the picture perfect Viceroy... ❤️"

","Hard to leave!","We spent 4 nights here in a deluxe terrace room. From the moment we arrived at the airport we were treated like royalty by our driver, Chess, and the rest of the Viceroy staff. Our room was wonderful with our own pool, in fact, we hardly left the room other than to eat! The breakfast was excellent with plenty of choices. We only ate one dinner at the hotel as we enjoyed going into Ubud in the evening and very much appreciated the free shuttle service provided by the hotel. The food was good but might be the slightly weak link in what is a really fantastic hotel. My wife's fish dish was undercooked but after pointing this out it was deducted from our bill so no hard feelings. A wonderful stay and can't recommend highly enough. A beautiful hotel in a stunning and peaceful location."

","Definitely nice but not as nice as the price suggests.","All in all, the Viceroy is a very nice hotel. The staff is friendly and helpful. The views from the hotel are beautiful. I watched a troop of monkeys parading through the forest across the way from my hotel room when I woke up my first morning. However, there were a few things that I was surprised by given the cost of the hotel. The food is mediocre. Eat breakfast there because it's free and convenient but don't waste any time eating lunch or dinner here. Go into town to eat. This seems minor but the free milk in my mini-bar was expired by two months. These sort of details matter and stand out when you expect a five star experience. I'm really not that picky of a traveler, but when you pay that much money for a room, you expect most things to be in order."

","The relaxation you are looking for","The resort sits in the middle of rice fields. That is my favorite part. My wife and I visited ubud to see the monkeys and relax in Jun. The resort provides free shuttle service to ubud center so the monkey seeing was very convenient. We were able to wake up in the morning to have a very nice breakfast at the restaurant. Then we could just walk out of the resort and was immediately embraced by the borderless green rice field.The other parts of the resort were totally up to standard too. The villas were spacious. We tried garden villa and terrace villa. The room in the garden villa was actually more spacious. But the insuite pool was definitely better in the terrace villa. When we stayed in the terrace villa, we spent one entire morning looking at the other side of the valley because of a group of monkeys happened to be hanging out there. The feeling of total relaxation with food, drink, and monkey viewing was definitely one of most memorable experience among all of our vacations.The service was top notch too. No complaints.We didn't really use the common area or the public pool that much. But this doesn't belittle the nice view you can enjoy at the pool."

","Beyond WOW!","We stayed here for two weeks in June - July 2015 having carefully chosen the Viceroy from other hotels in the area. We were blown away by the stunning location, amongst picture perfect rice fields and lush tropical forest. Our garden villa was HUGE with a private outdoor area including pool. The bed (also huge) was super comfy with the softest bedding which made getting up a daily struggle! Bathroom and toiletries all exceeded our (very high) expectations. The whole villa is so tastefully furnished with a mix of traditional and contemporary styles.The entire Viceroy team from housekeepers, drivers, reception and spa therapists to waiters, bar staff, front of house and chefs were without doubt the best we have ever come across in our travels. Their genuine kindness, fascinating local knowledge, and great humour made us feel part of their family, and very sad to leave after two wonderful weeks. CasCades restaurant served a delicious and substantial a la carte breakfast every morning, with a (not so) casual menu for poolside lunches: burgers, french fries and spring rolls feature as you might expect, but prepared and presented to the very high standard of a top class kitchen. Chef Nic and his team spoiled us with unique dinner choices from the extensive menu of local and international dishes. They even created off-menu personal favourites of ours - thanks guys! Meanwhile Joy and her dream team of waiting and bar staff kept us fed, watered and entertained at all times - cheers!"

","Best hotel in Bali!","We had an exceptional stay at the Viceroy. During our holiday to Bali, we traveled to Seminyak, Nusa Ceningan, Ubud, and Nusa Dua. We stayed in four different hotels, three of which were 4 stars or higher. I can say with absolute certainty that our experience at the Viceroy was absolutely the best. We were beyond impressed with the quality of our villa, the friendliness of the staff, the attentiveness of the restaurant staff both at breakfast and while lounging by the pool, and the general services offered (shuttle to Ubud, shuttle to our next hotel, laundry services, spa services, etc.). We also were pleasantly surprised with the general cost as well. We felt that prices at the hotel were very reasonable, especially considering prices at our final hotel in Nusa Dua. All in all, the Viceroy was by far the best hotel we have both every stayed at, and we will absolutely return."

","Wow wow wow. Amazing beautiful place, heaven on earth!","We stayed here for 3 night in June 2015 for our honeymoon.We arrived and were given flowers and ice tea. We were then taken to our room and given a little tour and a a little happy honeymoon cake. :-)We felt like we had arrived in heaven and you couldn't take the smiles off our faces!!We ate at the restaurant every night, one night we got room service! The food was delicious and similar prices as you'd pay in England for a nice meal. We were pushing the boat out for our honeymoon so didn't mind.The bed is ridiculously big but more importantly comfy. :-)We loved the do not disturb lights that you switch on as it means you don't get disturbed in the morning.We were in room 28, we think it was one of the best rooms. Quiet as on the end but still close to the restaurant and no slopes to climb.Our only niggle would be that the pool was pretty cold and we didn't use it as much as we thought we would. I think this is because the sun has gone out of most of the villas by about 1pm. If you want to soak up the rays you can head to the main pool after this.I had my birthday out there as well and they bought me a mini birthday cake at breakfast.Unfortunately we couldn't check out later so waited by the main pool until our transfer at 6pm but was nice and chilled and the shower facilities are lovely.Oh, the free taxi runs to the town were great. We wondered around a few times.We would love to visit again in the future. :-)Thank you for a really relaxing few days to end our honeymoon. :-)"

The cocktails were great and the bar staff were friendly yet had a five star swagger about themselves. The meal was exceptional, the raw tuna starter was incredible. If you are in Ubud and want exceptional food there is no better place to go to."

","Beautiful hotel and wonderful staff","We spent four nights here and the Viceroy will definitely be on our short list of great hotels in the world. We stayed in one of the villas and the plunge pool was such a nice feature. Our room was private and spacious with amenities you expect and the bathroom was as well. The staff were so courteous and helpful, even brought me a spool of thread and a needle when I mentioned needing to fix a button. The drivers were always on time to shuttle us to a reservation and when we departed very early on our final day, they had boxed breakfasts ready for us that included a full meal and cold juices. A beautiful hotel in a gorgeous setting."

","Four star hotel pretending to be five star","This is a very nice hotel but the only thing 5 star about it is the beauty of the design and the location. The food in the restaurant is only average. It's not bad but not what you would expect in a five star hotel. Plus the service in the restaurant is spotty. Our room was very pretty but the sink, tub and shower were all outside--beautiful and very private but not the best for cooling off or dressing for dinner in a humid, hot tropical setting. The hair dryer was attached to the wall like you would see at a Motel 6. After what they charge for the rooms, you think someone stealing a hair dryer would not be a concern. As with all Balinese, the staff were very friendly and anxious to please but clearly not particularly well trained. The owner of the hotel wanders around like the plantation master. Perhaps he should wander around less and actually manage the hotel. The Viceroy is not bad but if you want a true 5 star experience go the Four Seasons or the Ritz which just opened."

","Paradise!","My husband and I stayed here for part of our Honeymoon in Bali. From the moment we entered the lobby the service we received was excellent! Our room was so spacious and luxurious and the private pool on our terrace meant that we very rarely had to leave the room, not to mention how comfortable the bed was! We had a terrace room.The whole hotel is so private and serene, a great place for a honeymoon couple. We had treatments in the spa on a number of occasions, one that included a 2 hour treatment followed by a flower petal bath! The staff were so professional and the massage would rival any of the top spa's that we have stayed in in the UK. Just perfect. Food was delicious in the cascades restaurant with great cocktails! It is on the pricey side compared to other places that we had stayed in Bali, but it was worth every penny! We will definitely be going back to the Viceroy in the future!"

","Best and most beautiful resort I've ever been to","I’ve been to several five-star resorts before, but the Viceroy Bali tops them all. Our room was so spacious, it was more of a luxurious apartment instead of just a room. We had the Deluxe Villa with private terrace and private infinity pool. The view from our terrace was absolutely breathtaking: imagine yourself standing high up a hill with an all-green scenery around you. On a side-note: many people will probably use the free shuttle to the city to eat out downtown, but I would recommend to at least have one dinner in Viceroy’s own restaurant (Cascades). Surely, it’s pretty expensive, but they have an amazing chef who creates beautiful culinary dishes. And to be fair, the price is the same as I would pay for any other haute cuisine restaurant. Try the foie gras ravioli, it’s amazing!Bali is an amazing place, we’ll probably go back again someday. Should that day ever happen, than I’d love to revisit the Viceroy: escaping reality for a few days and enter a world of total relaxing and luxury."

","Incredible atmosphere","My wife and I with our three kids spent a wonderful day at the Regal Villa of this classy resort. Not that you will find many kids there ;)The main reason of our visit was to enjoy the mystical view of the valley. And we did! The atmosphere gets into your soul and won't leave you for a while. The infinity pool gives you the sensation to float between the palm trees.The regal villas are at the bottom of the structure, being closer to the valley and its sounds, with an uncluttered view. Most of the other rooms are terrace villas on the top which also enjoy the view from their private pools but with some rooftops underneath. Have a look at the 360 degrees view on the website to get a feeling of what you will get.Our villa was well furnished with a Bowers & Wilkins Zeppelin speaker, a coffee machine with Illy espresso, a fruit plate and a big bathroom. It was great to swim in the fresh private pool in the morning while listening to the birds. The staff is very friendly engaging also in casual conversation when appropriate.A nice plus is the exquisite a la carte breakfast in the morning which will surely satisfy your senses. The only remark is about the hefty price that could be easily half of it while maintaining its luxury exclusivity. We are very happy we stayed at this top location. It enriched our souls and experience in Bali."

It is a perfect place if you want a relaxing holiday, stay at Viceroy Bali definitely could become a stress-relieved.From the beginning, the service was very good and the driver who picked me up at the airport was very friendly.The reception desk staff, the housekeeping staff, the Restaurant staff, and the PR manager Mr. Andi was very nice and really helpful.and the food is great.. I love it.It was an unforgettable trip I have ever experienced.All things in this Hotel are highly recommended!!If I have another chance, I would love to stay at Viceroy Hotel again."

","Wedding/Honeymoon","My fiancé and I were looking for places to chose as our destination wedding/honeymoon. After a friends recommendation, along with a quick online search, there was no doubt in our minds that the Viceroy would be the perfect fit for us.Customer Service:Top notch right from the beginning!! Panca and Andi's prompt email responses were extremely helpful, making us all but forget the 12 hour time difference, while making our wedding planning process stress-free. From the moment Dwi picked us up from the airport, we knew this was going to be the trip of a lifetime. Dwi was very friendly, extremely knowledgeable, and we became fast friends. While at the resort, buggy service is only a quick call away and the housekeeping is the best we have ever experienced. We would definitely recommend the couples massage at the Lembah Spa as well. Food:Breakfast each morning was nothing short of delicious. From freshly squeezed juices to fresh fruit, the menu is big enough to allow you to try something new every day. Lunch and dinner at the CasCades Restaurant was always an enjoyable experience with some of the best food we have ever had. We were also thrilled to have met their head Chef Nick who graciously customized our dinner the night of our wedding. Room:Once we checked in, we were stunned at how beautiful our room was. There were no words to describe the accommodations and the incredible views the deluxe terrace pool villa offered. Villa #16 is situated in such a way it gave us unobstructed views of the peaceful Petanu River Gorge below. The room was super clean and the housekeeping staff and room service was impeccable. Wedding:There are no words to describe what the Viceroy did for our wedding. Again, Panca, Andi, Jero, as well as Mr. and Mrs. Otto made our Wedding Day absolutely unforgettable. From the color scheme and decor, to the abundance of flowers and gorgeous set-up, every last detail seemed perfect. The staff also surprised us with a wedding album, professionally put together but the photographers we had. Once finished, Dwi kindly delivered it to us at our second hotel. All and all, our wedding ceremony and stay at the Viceroy lived up to every expectation as we hope to one day visit again. Our only regret was that we didn't stay longer. "

","Luxury Hotel but not Luxury Service","This beautiful hotel is located in the popular tourist town of Ubud, Bali. the setting for the hotel is beautiful and with just 25 luxury villas, it presents the opportunity for luxury service. the villas are beautiful, set on a hillside. our one bedroom ( garden villa #7 ) was a bit unusual in that the bathroom ( sinks, shower, toilet ) were outside, but not to worry, totally private. here's the issue. the climate can be very steamy, so more from a woman's perspective, getting your hair dried or makeup done can be challenging ! i don't believe all villas have this configuration but you might want to check on making a reservation.the villa has a fantastic plunge pool.on the PRO side, this resort : has very friendly employees and service; the setting and small pool complex is beautiful; the room is well appointed and clean; the breakfast , which is included, is al a carte so everything is fresh and made to your liking; there is great shuttle service to go into Ubud and for you iPad addicts, the internet service is quite reliable; the laundry service is excellent.on the CON side : the service is not very professional or reliable ( when compared to the Four Seasons in Bali, which we stayed at before coming to the Viceroy, the Viceroy service is 4 * and the Four Seasons is 5 * ); the most spotty service is found in the restaurant; the food is good but not great, there are 2 menus, a more casual menu for lunch and also available at dinner and a more formal menu at dinner; the pool area , which is located next to the bar/restaurant, does not have a full time pool attendant so you have to flag down a staff member to get service; the outdoor area at the villa and plunge pool, could use ceiling fans to get air movement and make sitting outside more comfortable; the restaurant/bar is open to outsiders and one day when we were having lunch at the bar, they seated a large tour group ( more than 12 ) who were really obnoxious and we couldn't wait to get the hell out of there ( i understand the need to draw revenue but if you're going to do it limit their size and seat them away from your guests; it really destroys the exclusive atmosphere ); one strange thing at the hotel is that the owner, an older Austrian gentleman, is there full time and without getting into details gives the atmosphere a plantation feeling not a professionally run hotel."

","Fabulous Hotel","The villa was the best. Each villa includes its own small pool, plus the hotel swimming pool itself is great. The entire property is gorgeous, everywhere you look there is nothing but natural and/or architectural beauty. The service is great, you couldn't ask for friendlier or more helpful people. Top-drawer experience start to finish. We ate all our meals at the Viceroy Restaurant, which is excellent (although it is all outdoor seating and it did get hot, plus the overhead fan was not working). Be advised that the town of Ubud itself is kind of filthy and really doesn't have very much to recommend it. However, the hotel is some distance from the town and the hotel itself is very clean.The Viceroy is simply an unbelievably beautiful place and I can't recommend it highly enough.The Viceroy is a hotel for couples and not ideal for families with kids.

","Absolute luxury meets absolute paradise...with a dash of minor 'flaws'","My fiancé and I recently stayed in this dreamy hotel, and everything about our stay was just about magazine perfect. We'd booked our own driver for airport shuttling, as well as one day of sight seeing -- cheaper than going through the hotel, and easy enough to research ahead of time - or, 'select' one of the hundred drivers awaiting customers upon exiting the airport. Our flight out of Hong Kong was delayed several hours, so our evening arrival made for a lovely hour and a half night ride to Viceroy; we'd even arranged for our driver to have a few beers [and water] chilled for the ride - highly recommend, it hit the spot and made the transport part of the adventure. As soon as we pulled into Viceroy, we could see luxury dripping from every pore. The adorable, friendly staff greeted us with delicious smelling frangipani leis, and a refreshing iced herbal tea. We were told we were upgraded from our Terrace Villa to a Deluxe Terrace Villa, which at first sounded divine... more on that in a bit. After a breezy check-in, we hop in their grounds golf cart and catch a ride to our room. Flowers are everywhere, and you really feel quite secluded, tucked into this tropical forest. The Deluxe Terrace Villa, first of all, is Huge. Mostly unusable space, but visually appealing of course in its well-appointed vastness. It has an outstanding large soaking tub, romantic open shower, ginormous larger-than-King-bed, and your own personal patio complete with private infinity pool. We immediately ordered from the 24-hr room service, and dipped into the fruit bowl and bottled water, provided daily - fresh and delicious (and great plane snacks upon departure!). Stepping out onto the patio revealed the starriest sky I've seen in ages, and peaceful sounds of night insects and a rushing river below. Absolute heaven coming from a bustling city. Our room service arrived right on time, and was pretty delicious, resulting in a fantastic sleep.... until 7am...The Deluxe Terrace Villas share walls. We lucked out with one on the end, however our neighbor decided 7am was the perfect time to plug his phone into the provided charger/stereo and blare techno music at 200 decibels. We decided before breakfast we'd request a switch to our original Terrace Villa reservation. The breakfast is included, ala carte, and quite yummy, with fantastic cappuccinos! The front desk happily accommodated our switch, even let us see it first, then said they'd call when it was ready later in the afternoon. Whilst waiting, we spent the day in our plunge pool, which was delightfully warm as bath water. I rarely swim because I'm a pansy about cold water, so this was a real treat. We spent all day floating and lounging in the poolside pagoda overlooking the gorgeous river valley. When it came time to switch, they transferred our bags and in we waltzed to another perfect villa - no shared walls. Same luxury, less unused space, this villa actually felt more romantic and cozy despite it's still-vast size. Appointed with the same amenities, we had no complaints! A word on the Cascades restaurant - wow they do an amazing job. Every single dish we had there, from breakfast to dinner, was outstanding. And amazing still were the cocktails! You won't get the watered down, all-inclusive resort style drinks here -- these were well crafted and top notch. I couldn't wait for lunch and dinners to try a new one on the list! The wine on offer was also terrific, so you definitely won't be hurting to leave the hotel for something tasty - the service and the food was truly way, Way above par. You're close enough to Ubud proper to utilize their free shuttle service should you like to venture out for artsy shopping or restaurants, which we did for one dinner and one breakfast (see my reviews for those!). Cascades is never crowded because the hotel is boutique small. You'll never worry about your getaway feeling like a people-smothering resort with a bouncy, fake tropical cd on repeat. It's all very low-key and classy, down to the music selections and live piano dinners - the pianist takes requests.. indulge, he's very good!The remaining days in our new villa proved fantastic and.. interesting. This is where I get trivial, where truly these are MINOR 'flaws' ... Viceroy is flawless. But! One must give truthful, constructive criticisms, so here goes: 1. The Terrace Villas apparently share one pool heater, so the water was unfortunately so cold, all romantic swimming ceased. I couldn't get in. We called about the temp multiple times, and there just wasn't much they could do. Did it ruin my trip? Of course not. But we did pay for a 'heated pool' as advertised, which I was very excited to partake for once. 2. I believe the Terrace Villas may also share water heaters/pumps? At one point the water pressure dropped so low during a shower it took 15 minutes to get soap out of my hair. It lasted 20 minutes at least, so filling the bathtub would've been impossible had I gone that route. 3. Speaking of hair, ladies, bring your shampoo/conditioner! I typically enjoy not packing these items as luxury hotels usually have fun, high quality goodies to partake. Unfortunately not the case here. I did love their 'green' approach of filling ceramic jars, but sans pumps, it's stressful trying to shake creams out of slick ceramic with wet hands while standing over ceramic tile. Not breaking one was an act of pure concentration. And a whole jar of the conditioner didn't condition or untangle a single knot -- I stayed in ponies and buns the whole trip.Again, deal breakers? Of course not! Petty things, but I'd be loathe to not enlighten my fellow travelers!At the end, Viceroy did actually compensate us for the heated pool issues, which speaks volumes to their class and stellar approach to service. They even made mention they were looking to install an additional heater in the coming months to mitigate the issue. I had the best sleep and recharge possibly of my life at Viceroy, and can't recommend it enough. Everything about the hotel is beautiful and of very high standards. You won't be disappointed with this tropical gem - they make it very hard to leave!!"

","Paradise Found - Bali Edition","The Viceroy Bali is a perfect place if you're looking for a bit of relaxation and culture. It's set in the city of Ubud, a city about an hour and a half drive from the Denpasar airport. The hotel is beyond perfect for a honeymoon. It's private and so incredibly accommodating. Don't miss the spa while you're there - top 3 massages I've had in my life! Go for the deluxe terrace villa - complete with massive room and private pool overlooking the valley below. Ubud has amazing attractions as well including rice fields, markets, temples, coffee plantation and monkey sanctuary. Stay a while. You won't regret it!"

","Incredible Hotel","The Viceroy is the most beautiful hotel. We stayed here a couple of weeks ago as the final stop on our honeymoon in Bali and it was the most perfect final two nights we could have wished for. The staff really make time to speak to you and get to know you and nothing is too much trouble. The actual hotel is better than in the pictures, we couldn't capture just how beautiful it was on camera. In terms of its location it is slightly out of Ubud but not so far that you can't go out to eat or visit the sights and there is a shuttle from the hotel anyway which is really good. It is slightly more expensive than other 5 stars here but totally worth the money. We really hope that one day we'll be able to go back again."

","Luxury in beautiful Ubud","If you got this far on Trip Advisor, then just book the Viceroy. You won't regret it. PROS:1. Located in beautiful Ubud. Ubud is full of Bali charm. It's an artist's paradise. Not quite overrun like Denpasar and Kuta, by tourists, but still contained a small village feel. 2. Shuttles! Free shuttles to two locations in Ubud. Both ideal for finding a great meal or shopping. Both within walking distance if The Monkey Forrest. Don't get a guide or book a tour for Monkey Forrest. Take the shuttle and pay the few thousand rupiah. You can enjoy it at your own pace.3. The villas and grounds are spectacular. Just gorgeous. See photos of the villa we stayed in. They speak for themselves. Just beautiful. Infinity pool. Huge King bed. Enormous bathroom with soak tub.4. Breakfast. It was included with our stay and the choices were great. It's made to order, but all you can eat. You won't go hungry and we showed up early every morning to get a prime seat. The hotel is not crowded. It's a boutique hotel, nestled nicely near a rice terrace. You can walk the terrace as well. It's scenic. I cannot say enough great things about Viceroy staff. They were superior in hospitality, all the way. Loved this place!We stayed in a Deluxe Terrace villa 22. It was on the end of the row, so if you get that one, you will have neighbours on only one side. That's a positive for me.CONS1. Since the hotel faces East, the sun will never fully heat your villa pool. By mid day you likely won't have much sun at all. Use the main pool from noon and beyond."

The scent of frangipani lingered everywhere, but was not overpowering. The villas were a little piece of heaven. Exceptionally large, luxurious and beyond peaceful - with frangipani tastefully throughout. Having your own private infinity plunge pool literally overlooking the Valley of Kings was the cherry on top. The food was excellent - even breakfast was a culinary delight and the turkey club a gourmet experience. The spa is out of this world too. Did a lot of sight seeing, thanks to Dwi's help, but dying to go back and just relax in the Viceroy next time. There really is no valid reason to ever leave this place. I cannot thank everyone there enough."

","Total relaxation","The Viceroy clearly deserves all the accolades it receives here on Tripadvisor. The Viceroy provides a unique jungle setting along with true five star luxury and service.We stayed in Terrace Villa 5 and couldn’t have been happier with our accommodations. Conveniently located at the bottom of a stairway which leads to the restaurant and main pool, our villa was beautifully appointed and had a striking view of the Petanu River gorge. We loved waking up at sunrise and watching the mist over the gorge from our private pool and bale as the sun came up over the tree line. The furnishings of the villa were both tasteful and comfortable. There’s a large open air bathroom located at the back of the villa with a soaking tub, open shower, dual sinks and an enclosed toilet. There’s also an outdoor shower off the pool. There’s a nice size mini bar fridge with extra space for personal items which you can stock up on in Ubud. Four large glass doors open onto the terrace or directly into your private pool. Air conditioning, along with the ceiling fan, provided just enough power to cool the room without making things too hot or too cold. There’s a large flat screen TV as well as a nice sound quality iPod docking station to play your playlists on while enjoying the pool and the view (something we did often).Included in the room rate is breakfast each morning in Cascades restaurant or for an additional $5 you can have breakfast delivered to you villa. There was a nice selection of juices, coffees, fruit plates, bread/pastry baskets as well as cook to order eggs and other items available. Service was efficient and professional and the staff will be referring to you by name within a couple of hours of checking in and throughout your stay. Complimentary transportation is available throughout the day and into the evening into Ubud and the surrounding areas for shopping or dinner at local restaurants. You can also arrange personal tours further out to temples, coffee plantation, the volcano, rice paddies, etc. All of the drivers we had during our stay were extremely personable and helpful.Our rate also included a 2 hour couple’s massage at Lembah Spa. It was by far one of the best massages we’ve ever had. The unique feature to the sap is that they only serve one couple at a time so you have the entire spa to yourself during your treatment. The only disappointment we experienced during our entire stay was with the one dinner we had at Cascades. It started when my wife ordered a cosmopolitan, which is on their drink menu, only to be told that they couldn’t make it because they didn’t have any cranberry juice. Then one of the starters we ordered was never served with no acknowledgement or apology from the wait staff. We then ordered a nice bottle of wine only to be told it was no longer available. After selecting an alternative bottle, they somehow found the original selection. Service seemed rushed at some points and slow at other. While the food quality and presentation were nice, portions were very small for the prices charged. We found this a bit strange because the service, quality and portions at the other meals we had at Cascade during breakfast and lunch were great.Even with the misstep at dinner in Cascades, I still give the Viceroy a five star rating. It’s a stunning property in a beautiful location with a great staff all working to make sure you have a great stay."

","Amazing Introduction to Bali","I guess if you are going to Bali and want to enjoy your most relaxing, catered and friendly vacation, there's no other place I'd recommend so far than Viceroy Bali. From the moment Dwi picked us up at the airport, we knew from his service and friendliness we were going to enjoy our time in Bali. The experience of checking in after 25 hours in travel from home to the Denpasar airport was first class. They made every effort to make it easy to go from car service to our Terrace Villa. Walking through the grounds of amazing flowers and green, lush surroundings was only the first sigh of relief that we chose the right hotel. Next, we opened the door to our Villa and knew that we made the right choice...as we gazed into the azure pool, relaxing Bale (outdoor hut) and all the touches of luxury you would expect.The staff is so friendly, and helpful. They are well trained for service, and are great at making suggestions of things to do around the area. The restaurant CasCades has a stunning view for breakfast, afternoon bar/drinks or a romantic evening dinner. The food is fresh, delicious and well presented - something a gourmand like me lives for!In fact, yesterday we spent all day in our hotel room, pool side, relaxing privately while enjoying the afternoon breezes and a view of the natural forest view from our balcony. They do a great job of keeping the property mosquito free and we haven't needed any anti-mosquito repellant on the grounds at all! Meals in the room are no less spectacular than in the restaurant - the food is hot, delicious, and well presented. There were so many delicious dishes to try, I recommend an evening of the Degustation menu (the Indonesian menu of course).We even had the pleasure of meeting the owner of the hotel and he was very cordial about our 10 day stay here. Would I come back again? In a New York minute (and that's no joke)."

","Best hotel we have ever stay at!! ","Well what can I say, we have the pleasure to visit many hotels but this hotel has been by far the best we have stayed at! The villas are just breathtaking! We would highly recommend the Terrace Villa 3. The views out to the jungle are just unbelievable. The villas are very spacious and private and the private pool and veranda are perfect to relax in your own villa if you wish or you can go to the main infinity pool which is also lovely. The staff were a highlight of our trip also, they were so welcoming and could not do enough for you. If you asked for something from reception you would have it sent to your room straight away! A must would be to wake up before the sunrise at 6:15 it's something we couldn't have but do each day of our trip! We can't wait to stay again soon! "

","Bliss","This hotel is a class above. The grounds, rooms (with your own pool!!) are really sublime. You can expect a very peaceful stay via very well trained and happy staff, and tasteful design all around.Take the hotel car to visit the local water temple, they treat you with chilled towels and water and looking after every need. Ok I have to admit something..I have eggs Benedict where ever I go, and I travel a lot. It's a good comparison between kitchens and style. Viceroy makes the best eggs bene I have ever had! Actually, the whole breakfast is brilliant and included in the price, and the view from the restaurant is beautiful. We stayed for three nights and spent a lot of time in the room. Why go out on the mad streets of Ubud when bliss is at hand? Ps bring your own champagne as it's very expensive at the hotel. Enjoy!"

The main pool is simply stunning and considering most guests are either at their private pool or out in Ubud or surrounding areas, you feel like you have it to yourself. The Restaurant serves up spectacular food for breakfast, lunch and dinner and I only wish I was there longer to try everything on the menu! The Degustation options are well worth it and I highly recommend. The extensive bar list was also impressive. Amazing wines and delicious cocktails that would rival any Sydney bar.The staff were amazing and made our stay very enjoyable. Nothing was too hard and then even remembered our names! The Management team are on the money have planned each element perfectly. I could not recommend a stay at the Viceroy more highly!"

","The most beautiful hotel ","We were here as the fist stay of our honeymoon and it was a great start. The room we got was spacious, clean and absolutely beautiful. I loved the outside shower and the private pool. One of the nicest thing about the hotel is the view of the Bali jungle and their breakfast (we tried a different plate everyday). The service is outstanding. I would recommend planning on staying a full day or two to enjoy the hotel, the view and the room, sometimes you get caught up in trying to get to know the city that you don't take advantage of the real gem, in this case the hotel."

","Breathtaking - truly beyond anything I could have imagined","The luxurious Viceroy is an oasis of modern luxury, tucked away in the secluded Valley of the Kings, a short five minute drive from the township of Ubud (with free shuttle buses to and from the hotel). The Vicaroy Bali feels like you're in our own private ancient city, combining the most beautiful and authentic traditions of Balinese culture with all the modern creature comforts. Only the true fighter will resist the relaxing temptation of the private horizon pool for a stressful time here. The staff are thoughtful, considerate and friendly and they make you feel like royalty here. The worst part about this place is leaving. But when you do, you'll be relaxed and satisfied that your time was well spent here in this Oasis."

","Beautiful& Private","An amazing beautiful hotel with stunning views of the forest, the infinity pool it has one of the best views and location, the surraundings are also very nice!It is a 15 min drive from the down town and they offer a complementary car service to take u there all day long!The restaurant is ok, but it can be better! The food selection is a bit limitated and very expensive! The food portions are fancy but small!The private pool villas are beautiful and stylish.Some of the people working there really amazing, some not interested :(Overall a beautiful experience, but next time I will try something different closer to the town."

","Beautiful","We stayed here for five nights while on our honeymoon and this was definitely our favourite place out of the 3 luxury hotels in bali we stayed (in the same price range). We had a garden villa and it was absolutely beautiful. We loved the indoor/outdoor design of the bathroom and pool area and the massive comfortable bed. The only problem with the pool was it was only heated twice a day, and as it's inside it doesn't get any sun, so it's too cold to use most of the time. It wasn't a big issue though, when it was heated we got to enjoy it as it was a very nice temperature.The view from everywhere you go within this small resort is stunning! And the food is absolutely amazing. The chef is fantastic. Even if you don't stay here I'd recommend visiting the restaurant. It's a pretty steep walk if you want to walk from your villa up to the restaurant or pool but you can call a buggy to pick you up (something we didn't think of doing, but fine as it helped up work off all the amazing food we ate while we were there). Breakfast was one of my favourite parts- it was always perfect, and just the right amount per portion. The restaurant is lovely but I really enjoyed it being brought to the room (something they do for an extra $5) to eat on our private terrace with the beautiful morning misty view. Wifi was fantastic, it's fast, included in the rate and you don't need a log in or password, it's just an open connection that's available from anywhere within the resort.Free shuttle into Ubud city center is great, a private car and driver will drop you off and organise a time and spot to pick you back up whenever you are ready. We had a couples massage while here and that was also really nice, we especially loved the rose petal bath in the spa, there must have been a thousand petals in there, perfectly set up to spell out ""I (heart) U"". There are lots of extra little things that made this stay really special- rose petals in the bath in our room on our last night, chocolate on the pillows each night, lots of bottled water in the room & in the door whenever you get in a car, honeymoon cake & birthday cake the day we checked out and great friendly staff that are happy to do anything for you.We just had a really great and relaxing stay and genuinely enjoyed every minute of it. A perfect little place right in the middle of beautiful Ubud."

","A perfect start to our honeymoon!!","By far the best luxury hotel we've ever visited!! The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. There was not a single request that was not honored. Barack called me Beyoncé, so he was my favorite!! :) He also told us about Havana for salsa dancing. Overall they all had great recommendations, Chess was great as well. Panca, the manager, was like a genie in a bottle, only you have an unlimited amount of wishes granted. We stayed in Garden Terrace Villa #9 and loved it! We thought about upgrading to a better suite but were already too attached to our villa. You can't go wrong with any villa selection. Breakfast was included in our reservation and it was the best part of our day. Everything is a la carte with no menu restrictions. Our room wasn't close to the lobby but that was fine as all you have to do is call the front desk and a buggie, golf cart, is there to pick you up within 5 minutes. I was impressed by the gym, although the treadmill abruptly shut off while I was in the middle of a run, no harm done :) overall they had decent equipment. We also included round trip transportation to the airport and I had a very pleasant conversation with Anggi about the Balinese culture in the drive to Seminyak. The Balinese are very inquisitive and ask a lot of questions, don't get offended by it, they are just curious and conversely answer any questions about them that you may have. A perfect start to our honeymoon! Thank you Viceroy Bali!!!"

","Relaxing Bali","After staying in another hotel in another city at another time, I couldn't figure out what all the hype was regarding Bali. I decided to try again and stay in Ubud this time. I found The Viceroy Bali. Now I can say that this is why there is all the hype. Viceroy Bali outshines and outdoes itself with regards to running a top notch operation. From the front desk to dining and all around hospitality this is on the mark. Room was very clean, spacious and comfortable, food and bar were excellent. We never waited long for a meal. Full breakfast off the menu was a great way to start the day. Spa is absolutely fabulous, infinity pool is wonderful. Staff are very helpful and friendly. Transportation to downtown Ubud is so convenient. What can I say other than I would come back here."

","Flawless!","We started our honeymoon with four days at this hotel and every single aspect of our stay, from check in to check out, was perfect. In the interests of objectivity, I've been wracking my brains trying to think of any negative points but I can't. It's truly the most amazing hotel I've ever stayed at. We were picked up at the airport in a hotel car and, from that point onwards, we were treated like family. The hotel is family run and I think this really comes through in the service you receive. All the staff seem genuinely happy and nothing is too much trouble. Everyone at the hotel wants you to have an amazing experience. We stayed in Regal Villa 2, which is down at the bottom, closest to the river. The room was superb and very comfortable. HUGE BED, comfortable sofa, big bathroom and a nice garden with an infinity pool. Pretty much everything you could possibly want. The view of the jungle valley is incredible and we had monkeys in the trees only a few feet away!The food is fantastic too! The breakfast is a la carte (which is perfect in the jungle as a buffet with all the insects around would be a disaster) and all the options are delicious. We especially liked the Balinese Benedict. The evening menu is very special too. French cuisine with a Balinese twist and all presented exquisitely. The pool and spa are everything you would expect from a 5* resort but with the added benefit of the amazing jungle view. We were very lazy during our stay (the hotel is that relaxing) but if you do want to pop into town, there's a free shuttle that will take you at a moment's notice. No timetable and no need to pre book. I'd recommend this again and again to any couple looking for a romantic getaway. As you can see, I'm running out of adjectives to describe how great this place is...perfect!"

","A slice of paradise","My husband and I stayed here for 6 days in mid March and didn't want to leave. Our booking included airport transfers and we were greeted promptly by Made at the airport.Upon arrival at the Viceroy, we were warmly greeted at reception and check in was attended to promptly.We booked a Terrace Villa and were upgraded to a Deluxe Terrace Villa. The room was luxurious, spacious, modern and very well maintained. Great bathroom facilities, huge comfortable bed and lovely linen. Comfortable lounge area in the room with TV/sound system set up and a beautiful terrace with heated pool overlooking a lush tropical gorge.Good lighting throughout the room and everything was spotlessly maintained each day. The housekeeping seemed to happen magically each morning while we were at breakfast.The gym is well equipped and has everything you need for a workout. Wifi was included and quick.We used the resorts shuttle into Ubud a few times and this worked efficiently and easily for pick ups and drop offs.Breakfast at Cascades each morning was a treat. You can order from a good range on the menu and it was better than having a buffet where you can tend to overeat. Everything was beautifully presented, flavoursome and arrived quickly. The service from Agung, Wayan and Hendra was very good and we enjoyed chatting with them during our meals.We had cocktails and dinner at Cascades a couple of times and again, everything was beautifully presented. Our package also included a romantic dinner one evening which was set up with rose petals and a special menu - thank you!We had a couples 2 hour spa treatment which included a massage, salt scrub, yoghurt and flower bath - just bliss - thank you to Sudi for looking after me!We were staying here during Nyepi so we ordered room service that evening which was delicious.All the personal touches were always on display here. Could not fault anything about the resort, the staff or the service. It is a credit to everyone involved and the staff should be very proud of the service they provide to guests.Thank you for making it such a wonderful holiday for us. We will definitely back."

","Good but needs some improvements","We stayed two nights in the Terrace pool Villa and the property is beautiful. The good A la carte breakfast Free shuttle to ubud areaRooms Front desk personals The badPaper thin walls we can hear everything Bugs in the room (to be fair we are in the forest) Breakfast takes a while after you order, and inconsistent. I think the head chef must have had the day off or perhaps drank too much the night before at the bunnies and bowties event lol. the first day it was so yummy and the presentation was nice. My flat white coffee had design, the next day the same coffee looked like a mess with no coffee art, my husband sunny side egg for his noodles was clearly overcooked and dried out. We also had ""dinner"" one night I was looking forward to the find dining menu more specifically the fore grias entree but when we got there only the lounge was available with the casual menu, we asked for the fine dining menu which was not the same one as the one in the room??? We were starving and the waitress clearly seemed preoccupied with the special event dinner so we just ordered a pizza and noodles.... Which took 35 mins to come.... Just as we were about to walk out..... The first day after we checked in we were on cloud nine, we got upgraded to the Terrace pool Villa for our Honeymoon and got so much attention. People knew our names, but the next day everything went down hill, it was like the staffs on the day of check in all got the day off the next day?? I guess the bar was just set high..... Regardless still a place to visit and stay.... Once in a life time"

","One in a Million","I spent two nights here after having spent a few nights at other hotels in Bali. I'm so glad I stayed here last, as I would have spent my entire trip comparing hotels to the Viceroy had I gone there first. Simply put, the Viceroy Bali is a dream. Secluded, surrounded by stunning jungle, beautifully designed, cozy spa, impeccable food, warm staff, gorgeous suites and grounds—the list goes on. Only when I left the hotel did I realize how little time I spent outside my room. With a private plunge pool and sala (a gazebo-style sitting area above the pool), I didn't need or want to. I can't say enough about this dreamy little place, except this: go there!"

They offer a complimentary driver to take you to any local restaurants, shopping and attractions. The staff and service cannot be faulted and we were immersed in such a peaceful and private surroundings.They also source foods, products and materials locally which gains huge points in my books.There is a Villa to suit everyone. Highly recommended and I will be returning.I recommend the Viceroy to all friends and family alike!"

","Beautiful Hotel, Excellent Service","My husband and 2 year old stayed at the Viceroy Bali one weekend in mid March. It was a most delightful and comfortable stay and would definitely recommend it to family and friends. We particularly liked that the hotel was so close to Ubud and in our opinion, the free private car shuttle service to the Ubud town was the most value added service offered. It saves you the trouble of having to look for your own transport or haggle with the town taxi drivers. It was safe, convenient and reliable. For a little more (USD 5 each way), the private car would also take you to the Ubud branch of Naughty Nuri's (which is a little outside the Ubud main town).The 3 of us also took the half day tour (approx 4 hrs) offered by the hotel. It covers the rice fields in Tagalalang, the Holy Spring Temple, a coffee plantation (with coffee/tea/cocoa tasting) and lunch with views of a still active volcano, Our guide for the day was the hotel's own staff member, Margi. Margi was an awesome tourguide, knowledgeable in many aspects of his hometown. From education, agriculture, culture, religion and even the legality or illegality of cock fighting in Bali - we had an extremely good time. Margi was also excellent with our 2 year old. He got her fish food to feed the fish in the temple and held a grasshopper in his hand to let her have a closer look at the insect. Definitely a big thumbs up to Margi for being such a wonderful driver and guide.The hotel itself is peaceful and serene. We stayed in a Deluxe Terrace Villa and the rooms are big, bright and clean. The bed was comfortable and the toilet/bathroom, luxurious. The villa pool was of a good size and very clean (but just be careful if you have kids because it is 1.45m deep). Breakfast in the hotel was also good.Overall, it was an excellent weekend ;)"

","Perfection - Dream Honeymoon Spot","My husband booked this hotel for our honeymoon. He specifically asked for a room that had a terrance private pool. The room, pool and view took our breath away. The pictures on this site doesn't do it justice. The service was top notch. They even will drive you for free to town and pick you up. Breakfast was fantastic though dinner left us wanting more. The only negative I would have is that there was no walkway up to the club house / reception and it was a up hill climb. However, you can call the reception desk and they would come pick you up in their fancy golf cart,...so I really can't compliant about that. All in all, I would really recommend staying here for the quality of the hotel and service."

","Idyllic Hotel, felt like a piece of Paradise on Earth","We stayed in the Viceroy Hotel in Ubud for three blissful nights at the end of our 10 day vacation in Bali. From the moment we arrived in the Viceroy we were blown away by the breathtaking scenery surrounding us. The infinity pool/bar & restaurant area, all overlook a forrest and if you look closely enough, you can see the monkeys swinging from the tress in the distance.Our Villa with own infinity pool was superb and we could have easily spent the three days cocooned in this little piece of paradise without going outside the hotel once. The staff were courteous and super helpful, even allowing us a late check out at 3.30 on the last day. The breakfast menu was one of the best I've ever seen and the options were endless. I can't think of anything to fault with this hotel.Maria(Ireland)"

","Privacy and Contentment","This is a small hotel with 5 star written all over it. The privacy of the villas is second to none, magnificent villas with personal pools and a huge wow factor. It has only 25 villas and is managed day by day by the people who own it. They have their own great stories and during the period of our stay all made personal contact with us and responded to our whims. The restaurant is first class and run with extreme efficiency and an excellent Belgium chef. He is interested in all the different nationalities that stay there, so he comes out of the kitchen and talks to the patrons to find out what foods they like and if it isn't on the menu he will go out of his way to make it happen.The staff have been given the ability to let their own personalities shine through, so they are not only very good at their jobs, but they are happy and love a good joke. Most of them started work here 12 years ago when the resort opened and they tell us that they will never leave, that blends into a happy workplace for them, which they pass onto the patrons in spades.We did all the tourist things that one does in Ubud, which includes the ridge top walk, rice paddy hike, the streets of Ubud, day and night and enjoyed them all.The volcano is highly visible from the resort and early morning photos of it are spectacular from the entrance of the resort.4 days before we left I found a hidden treasure curtesy of an American ladybwho has lived in Ubud since the 70's. We had taken a small hike on the track that goes past the resort, it consits of all rice paddies, she told me that at the end of the track to take a right turn onto a concrete path that the locals built to get into some other paddies. So I did, man it opened up to beautiful terraced rice paddies that no tourists go to, the volcano is its backdrop and because there is no power there,mothers are no poles or power wires. The walk is easy and spectacular, because the concrete is new it is level, so when you walk, you do not have to look down to check for trip hazards, therefore the walker enjoys the fields and the spectacular view of the volcano. The path winds its wat through the middle of the paddies and friendly farmers greet you with a smile and a wave. Half way around i found a small Koi fish farm, which is covered in water lilies. Towards the end of the track, the walker comes across rubber trees and banana trees , which in between the locals have planted their own vegetable crops, even a couple of cows. At the return part of the track is a river, which is controlled by small locks and the locals bath there and wash their clothes.The track is a hidden gem , that the resort staff can show you where to go. Do the walk early morning while it is cool and the light is perfect for photos.Just came back from massage at the spa, great way to finish the holiday, thank you Margaret , Otto, Amanda and Anthony for a great stay."

The ride from the reception to you ur villa is in a golf club car and it's make you fell very special. This is not a hotel or a resort. you fell like you are at home in your own story village.The villa are gorgeous, huge, all is like new inside and good smelling. The bed it's not huge it's extra huge :) the private pool are awesome ( may talk to the staff to make them a lilt bit warmer if the water its cold) .Walking fro the villa to the restaurant or spa or main infinity pool it's relaxing and very enjoying, you find a happy couple or a smiling staff member all the way :).The spa and massages are perfect.The restaurant it's one of the best with European dish and local Indonesian infusion. served a la carte the food it's absolutely delicious . You might have luck to be part of a show in a Balines traditional dance or piano classics. 5 * are not enough to classified this part of heaven. you look forward to come again and recommend all to book at least night there because it's like one in life time experiences."

","Luxury rooms with stunning views","The viceroy is stunning, it's ideal for honeymoons and we loved our stay here as part of our honeymoon - it was the most expensive hotel by far but (just about) worth splashing out! The huge rooms were so luxurious and well designed, set on a gorge with amazing private infinity pools that look out to forest where we watched monkeys swing from tree to tree - amazing! Our room, terrace and pool felt private and secluded.On the bad side, the restaurant serves pretentious overpriced food and the service was not 5 star, friendly but didn't compare to the Elysian in Bali which was a fraction of the price of the Viceroy. Two tiny examples being that we ordered room service and one item had been forgotten and on the last day we had to ring twice to remind them we needed a buggy to get us and our suitcases as we were checking out - when you pay this much you do expect perfection - service wise.The location is quiet and tranquil and they offer private shuttles to and from lovely Ubud town."

","Complete and utter perfection","I had initially booked for the week earlier but due to our daughter falling ill we had to change our booking. I was nervous about approaching the Viceroy about this as I knew how inconvenient it was.I received such compassion from the Staff who suggested other dates we could visit and a swift change was made. Absolutely no problem- we were very grateful and couldn't believe how easy the process was.When we arrived we were greeted with a fabulous surprise of an upgrade! We honestly couldn't believe it. The golf cart arrived and drove us to heaven - Villa 15.The view- spectacular & the ambience serene.Every detail was thought of, from the phone charger, the latest tv & stereo. The layout of the villa and amenities were fabulous.We were blown away by the total luxury and the service we received for our short stay honeymoon.We would thoroughly recommend the Viceroy in a heartbeat. We feel so lucky to have experienced this for one day! Anyone who has rated this anything less than a 5 could not have stayed at the Viceroy.We will return."

","Smaller scale 5 star with drop dead views","We enjoyed a 2 night stay at the Viceroy after 4 nights at Four Seasons Sayan and were not disappointed. Situated on the opposite side of Ubud to the Four Seasons, it allowed us to see another set of villages, streets and experiences of Ubud so it was a good combination when in Ubud for a week. While both resorts are above river gorges, the Viceroy is higher up, making for more expansive views, particularly at sunset. We were offered a low season reduced price package including daily breakfast, a complimentary couples hour long massage at their Lembah spa, free use of the spa jacuzzi and gym, and had our room grade upgraded on arrival. Complimentary wifi throughout the resort and a flexible daily shuttle service to Ubud through to 11 in the evening are also advantages ( the 4 seasons resort shuttle has 5 fixed time services on its shuttle and ceases at 5 pm, meaning if dining in Ubud, have to book a local taxi or pay additionally for the hotel car to pick up or drop off). The Cascades restaurant provided a beautiful dinner one night and speedy room service the second. We were also able to negotiate a very late check out on our departure day, till 6 pm, as our flight home did not leave until 1 am ( for an additional fee, but less than half of what a full day rate would be). The only potential negatives we experienced, and these were very minor, was there are a lot of mosquitoes in January, despite the resort spraying/ fogging while we were there; and a personal impression that the decor of the resort is perhaps a little more generic international than the more dramatic stone and wood of the 4 seasons. All in all we would recommend the Viceroy to higher end travellers who prefer the intimacy of a smaller but beautifully positioned resort. And we'd love to use the heliport next time!"

","Worth the extra money!!!! 5 star!!!!","From the moment we got to Viceroy we knew it would be the Bali we had been looking for. The staff make you feel like royalty from beggining to end and every step along the way.We stayed in there cheapest room the garden villa. Cheap is the wrong word to use because it was anything but. Amazing decor and ambience. Our own outdoor bathroom the size of most one bedroom apartments. Our own pool and the SUPER KING BED! !!!! If anyone has anthing bad to say about this place then they are impossible to please. The edgeless pool looking over the valley is a memory that will be edged into my brain forever. A must see for everyone in theor lifetime if travelling to UBUD!!! Do yourself a favour and spend a little more i promise you wont be disappointed.They also helped make our 5 year anniversary one to remember."

The free shuttle to Ubud centre is really great as well as the included breakfast :) The chef is amazing! Best view you will get at a restaurantThis hotel however would not be well suited to older people as there are alot of steps and the hill is steep to get to and from your room.

","Very good not outstanding","I must say that our review for Viceroy is quite mixed as our experience was indeed very good but our expectations were a bit different based on what we had read on trip advisor reviews which made us book this hotel as part of our honeymoon in Bali. Also our review is bit biased as well based on the fact that our first days in Bali was at the Four Seasons in Jimbaran which was out of this world experience and of course we compared one to other( equal cost experience as Viceroy)Things we liked in Viceroy:Overall hotel location which has beautiful jungle view.The room view as well, with the nice room pool and pagoda which also serves as great spot for postcard style pictures.Service was very good in regards to people being very willing and friendly.The transfer to Ubud which was really a great benefit.Things they were just good:Food/ breakfast was good but did not blew our mind away.Service was good, had its great moments but having been to Four Seasons before you could feel the difference between the small hotel training and the experience of very well trained staff that could almost read your mind and had the answer for all questions.Things we did not like:The fact that the actual rooms which are called villas according to our view are not exactly villas but suites. Villa for us is an independent building and this was not the case as our room was co joined to another room and we could actually every night hear our passionate neighbors:) therefore the outside part of room with pool and pagoda is basically a huge balcony and not a villa garden.For us however the biggest disappointment was the decoration/style of room/suite which is very simple, modern and does not have an atmosphere especially if you are on honeymoon. It reminds of being in a lux suite of a city Hilton/Intercontinental and definitely has no Bali touch apart from some vintage Bali pictures on the wall. Detail ...but even the lights ( at least most of them) in and out of the room switch on and off in groups therefore you cannot create a romantic atmosphere at night in the huge bathroom area or at the pool. Ok...call me a perfectionist but having a beautiful petal bath made but lovely staff...with all the bathroom lights full on bit ruins it..( suggestion add some candles/sticks in the bathroom area)Nevertheless, we gave four stars because it is a beautiful hotel and worth visiting ( maybe for a little less cost) but If I would go back to Ubud I would give it a try with a different five star hotel of the area.

","Perfection","Viceroy Ubud exceeded all our expectations. It's better than the best pics on their website, honestly. We agree with all the recent glowing reviews. Our Deluxe villa was at the bottom of the property, with literally breathtaking views of the private infinity pool, steep valley and lush tropical forest. The room was beautifully fitted out, and oozed quality... opulence without pretence. The service, facilities, food, cocktails and entertainment were all exceptional. The staff were skilled, professional, helpful and very friendly. Viceroy Ubud has redefined my idea of 'luxurious paradise'. Just book!"

","Honeymooners Paradise","The 5D/4N spent in the Terrace Villa of Viceroy Bali was undoubtedly the best any honeymooner could ask for. Be it the uber-luxurious villa with private pool, or be the breathtaking valley view from the balcony, or the cozy breakfast in bed options.After all this if you do manage to come outdoors, there's always the local sight-seeing in Ubud nearby with street shopping options and traditional Balinese dance shows every night. However, other attractions in Bali - the water activities/temples/beaches are a good distance away from the hotel."

","best side of Bali","Exquisit food. Absolute privacy. Did you know the water in Ubud is spring and much better than Kuta/Seminyak? Which is just another reason why we prefer Ubud. The Viceroy is close to Ubud but far enough away to avoid bad smell and noise. Cocktails by the main pool or skinny dip in your own infinity (delux terrace). And the heavenly menu...best in Ubud, probably bali, maybe even Indonesia."

","Paradise, one of the Luxury Resorts that you've always wanted to come back","I think of all the places that I visited and traveled last year 2013, Viceroy Bali totally Top my list (Deluxe Terrace Villa where I've last stayed) and this year 2014, I made a point to come back once again to this beautiful & amazing hotel.It was two weeks ago, when I visited Viceroy Bali and stayed for 3 days & 2 nights in two different Villas (Garden and Terrace). Viceroy Bali is located 5 mins. from the centre of Ubud and 50 mins. from the airport. On our first night, we stayed in ""Garden Villa"", which has a modern and unique design concept with a vast bedroom and sitting room opening onto an open garden bedroom which blends with an indoor swimming pool and lush tropical garden with a day bed. And on our second night, we stayed in ""Terrace Villa"", a more expensive villa than Garden villa, that feature a ""Bale"" pavilion perched dramatically over the private swimming pool with wonderful views over the RIver George, the vast bedroom and sitting room opens a designer bathroom. And, the view from this villa is amazing!!!Their breakfast menu in Cascade Restaurant is Fantastic, and a lot of great choices. During our dinner, we also tried their ""Indonesia Degustation"" Menu, a six-course local Indonesian cuisines, which I'm sooo highly recommends. And, our highlight of our stay is their ""Cleopatra SPA Treatment"" at Lembah Spa, which after their Spa treatment, I feel rejuvenated and relaxed. A 2.5 hours body treatment & pampering, from Body Exfoliation Scrub, 50 mins. Balinese Massage, Pedicure or Facial, to Floral Bathe. You can also use their facilities Hot Therapeutic Jacuzzi and Sauna.We also visited the ""Monkey Forest"" (one of the main attractions in Bali), which is only 10-15 mins. drive from Viceroy Bali and, Viceroy Bali offers a FREE car transportation to and from Ubud Centre, which is totally convenient for the guests. After 3 days & 2 nights staying in Viceroy Bali and second time being here, this luxury resort still WOWed me. No wonder, Viceroy Bali recently won 3 Recognised Unique Excellence Awards ""Asia's Best Boutique Hotel"", ""World's Best Honeymoon Boutique Hotel"" and ""Asia's Best Honeymoon Boutique Hotel"" by 2014 Boutique Hotel Awards (Knew and Read it on their Reception Wall).As a Traveler, who have stayed in too many luxury resorts/hotels. Indeed, Viceroy Bali, is one of the Luxury Resorts that you've always wanted to come back and I'm soooo highly recommending this hotel especially for all the Newly weds or Honeymooners!!! And, for all the people who want to fully relax and wanted to visit UBUD for the very first time, this hotel is a must-visit for you,Note: To know more about my stay here, read my BLOG.http://olympusgirlinsg.blogspot.sg/2014/12/viceroy-bali-one-of-luxury-resorts.html"

","A peaceful paradise in an island of beautiful people","Me daughter and I came to Bali because I had been here 45years ago! I knew it would be a beautiful holiday and things would have changed over the years, but what hasn't changed are the people and the landscape. We chose TheViceroy to stay for 10 nights and had the most wonderful time. We stayed in a deluxe villa ( an upgrade) and had our own paradise. Monkeys came to visit us, so did little birds and cute geckos. The view of the thatched rooves and green jungly valley were amazing! The food was out of this world as was the amazingly friendly staff in the restaurant ( special mention Agung, Edi and many others) - we've never laughed so much! We all cried when we said goodbye- we will never forget The Viceroy, Otto,Anthony and all the staff - thank you for welcoming us in to your ""family""!"

The staffs remember your name & room number, makes you feel special.The room in the terrace pool villa is spacious! The pool was beautiful overlooking the valley.The breakfast in the only restaurant at the hotel is amazing!! You pretty much order what you want and how many dishes you want!! Huge selection too. The restaurant serves the best room service- pretty much food from the restaurant which you have in your room.The hotel also offers free shuttle to Ubud centre.

","Perfect if you love boutique","I can see why fellow travellers rave about Viceroy. The staff were the star of this place. Nothing was too much to ask for and we were just well taken care of. The room itself was also very impressive. High ceiling which was adored. I can only tell you how grateful I am that the pool was heated - it means you can jump in during any time of the day, not having to worry about the temperature. Some things I'd like to address though. First it's about the pillows. We tried asking for firmer pillows as we found the ones in the room being too soft, and we were a bit disappointed that the hotel didn't have any other pillow types. I wouldn't need an extensive pillow menu but it would be nice if I could have other choices. The other would be the television. Its size would be perfectly fine if you sat on the sofa in the living area; but if you want to sit in bed and catch a movie the television is really a bit too small. Lastly, the villas are close to each other and you are basically connected to the villa next door. Which can be a problem when your fellow traveller is slightly less considerate and decided to start turning up the wifi system at 7am in the morning. I am absolutely grateful that the staff helped us deal with the issue in a swift manner but I must admit I was expecting a bit more privacy between villas.There is only one restaurant in the hotel and the spa menu is a bit restricted, but food was of very high quality and treatments at Lembah Spa were very relaxing. Having a free shuttle to Ubud from 7am to 11pm gave us the flexibility to find places to eat outside.I loved my stay at Viceroy very much, but I must admit I was caught slightly off-guard by Ubud itself - coming from a stay in Seminyak I was expecting Ubud to be much quaint and people-free compared to the nightlife town; however, I was overwhelmed by how many tourists there are in Ubud particularly Asians."

","Excellent Hotel","Stayed in a pool villa (number 10) for five days and hardly left the Viceroy. It is such a nice property. The staff were very friendly and eager to help. Even if you choose to stay in the cheaper garden villas, the common area pool is amazing and there is lots of room. The property is set among rice paddies so if you want you can go for a stroll out the front door and it's just as picturesque as inside. The Cascades restaurant has great food at good value, ask for the Casual Dining / Room Service menu if you want cheaper dishes than the pricier European dishes on the A La Carte menu, but would prefer to enjoy the view from the restaurant. The Breakfast menu has a wide selection and you may order as much as you like.The spa is a bit pricey, there are plenty of options for that in Ubud, as well as restaurants if you want to try some other places. There is a free shuttle to the centre of Ubud or the Supermarket, although the local Taxis are pretty reasonable - 100k will get you from one side of the city to the other. Otherwise it is a moderate 30 minute walk.There is an extensive range of books and movies available in the library to borrow, as well as a modest but complete air-conditioned gym."

","Best place for a honeymoon","We stayed at the Viceroy in October, and what a lovely villa it was to stay in. My husband had carefully planned and researched our honeymoon, and it was only the best he wanted. We certainly loved every moment of our stay at this fine establishment.Staff were very friendly, always had a smile on their face. Breakfast was lovely, we tried everything on the menu, nothing better then having good breakfast overlooking the ubud forest.We never managed to get a massage at the resort as they were booked on the timings we were free. but there are plenty of other great massage places around Ubud.Free shuttle service is very handy for going into town for a evening meal or shopping. They arrange for pickup when were finished.Only regret I have is, having to leave and come back home. Will certainly revisit again, and hope service and quality remains the same."

I was rather concerned when we arrived about going outside to the bathroom during the night, slightly worried about insects or bugs, but no need ....not a bug to be found. The villa was beautifully furnished and we had the best sleep ever. A lovely restaurant definitely worth a visit. A great service is the shuttle, we just requested a car into town and were dropped off at one of two locations in town, so much better than waiting for a shuttle bus. We hired a car with the very helpful Maddie, who drove us around and looked after us very well, taking us to the rice terraces and a couple of temples."

","Dream came true of a dream I never even knew I had!","Having always wanted to visit Bali, I didn't realize I would get my chance to and in Viceroy out of all places to break my Bali 'virginity'??? Can someone say spoiled?!A group of friends travelling Asia invited me out on a last minute getaway. I was sent one of the stock photos but it honestly did not do the resort justice. Trust me. The view of the jungle that can be seen from anywhere in the main lobby/restaurant area is absolutely breath taking. From the minute you reach your destination, you are greeted with friendly servers who quench your thirst with a glass of long island iced tea and adorn you with an orchid lei. Then came the second breath taking view which was that of our Presidential suite: a open concept living area that was literally open to the private pool, cabana and terrace sharing the same view of the jungle as the lobby. To either side of the living area was a massive bedroom with equally massive bathroom. Over 4000 square feet of space in this suite to be exact! My initial trip to Bali was preplanned for three days but that went out the window after the first night I spent in this hidden paradise in paradise. Over the course of our five day stay, the staff got to know us by name and really took notice all the little details that a 25 suite resort is able to notice. There was 6 of us which meant a plethora of towels needed for all the showers/swims/makeshift floor mats. The staff noticed this while cleaning and without fail, delivered extra towels to us every night for our midnight swims. We also got approached by the owner/gm(?) himself asking how everything was and he even sent over a round of delicious Irish coffees.Needless to say, I would come back here in a heartbeat! Kudos to the wonderful staff."

We loved every second of our stay in Ubud, from the fine dining at cascades, to the free transport into Ubud itself to the Balinese language lessons we instigated at every opportunity with the amazingly patient and friendly staff. The room more than exceeded expectations, with our private pool and gazebo, and we LOVED the outside chess table for winding down the day with a drink and a game.

","Unbelievable Honeymoon!","Having read the countless reviews, my wife and I decided to book the Viceroy for our honeymoon...and what a decision that turned out to be. There is a reason why so many have left raving reviews for this hotel, it is without doubt the best hotel I have stayed in. From the surrounding scenery, to the luxurious rooms and the impeccable staff, the Viceroy is pure paradise away from home. We stayed in the deluxe terrace villa, and I would only recommend staying here. The room's are very large in size, with an enormous bed (biggest I've ever seen!), your own espresso machine, incredibly spacious bathroom, and best of all, your own private pool. We stayed for 2 weeks, a long time in just one resort but not once did we feel we overbooked. The staff really ensured we were comfortable with every aspect of our stay, and are genuinely so cheery and happy to see the guests each day. No task is too much for them, and they will try every possible way to ensure your request is met and done. Whilst staying here you also get to meet the family who run the hotel. They are very friendly and warm and always made us feel welcome. The hotel itself is beyond beautiful. You can quite easily laze about each day and not be tired of the view. It's location is also very good, close to central Ubud with free shuttle's there and back - this we felt was great. There is so much to do in Ubud, but one thing the hotel offers to cycling through rice paddy fields which I would highly recommend! If you are travelling to Ubud, I wouldn't recommend staying anywhere other than the Viceroy...by far the best hotel in Bali, and for a honeymoon, its pure magic."

Villa 10 has the best view of the forest, without having to overlook all the other villa rooftops. Room service was spot on and the small touches of leaving fresh flowers in our room everyday was delightful and refreshing. We recommend the breakfast, we managed to try out everything besides the carrot and Ginger Juice which was always unavailable. Free shuttle service to and from town was a great service, which was very handy. Every member of staff was friendly and welcoming, it was great that they all knew us by our surname. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi, we felt like we stepped into paradise.Keep up the standard and service!"

Amazing villas (we stayed at deluxe villa 10) with incredible food at the Cascades restaurant. The staff and drivers were great and while it certainly isnt the cheapest place to stay in Ubud, you really get what you pay for. Only 10min drive to shuttle to the centre of Ubud town. The spa treatments here are also excellent. The villas are very well appointed and the pools (both main and villa) are very nice. Be aware that as this place is quite exotic you also wont see too many other visitors..most stay in the villas and are on honeymoon/loved up! Not a bad thing at all!Overall high quality, and the head chef (Belgium) while a bit aloof makes amazing food. Truely stunning.

","Unforgettable Honeymoon","Over the last two years my wife and I have stayed at a lot of hotels. The Viceroy is, by far, the best of them all. Future hotels we stay at now have the unfortunate disposition of being compared to this place. The people, the food, the service, were all second to none. Every member of the staff, and I mean every member, was so friendly and eager to please and their disposition was genuine. At NO time did we feel like they were being friendly for a tip. The view from the villa is so serene. Made to order breakfast in the room on the bure over the infinity pool was a great start to every day.

","A little piece of heaven","Wow is all i can really say, even typing this i become speechless. There are just soooo many positive and incredible things to say about her i just don't know where to start!?..The service is out of this world, by far the best place I have ever experienced and I am pretty sure no one will ever come close to comparison either. We were greeted and literally made to feel like we were royalty, flowers in place around our neck, drink in hand, flannel on the ready, then once all checked in we were then taken to the Viceroy Villa (this was the room we stayed at) on a golf buggy and on route to the villa we were given a 'show around' of the area which by the way was mind blowing. Beautiful secluded villas nestled among the heights of the jungle of Ubud. The swimming pool and restaurant area are picturesque to the fact that before you do anything you have to take your camera out and capture the entire place in every possible angle as you know you wouldn't believe it unless you have pictorial evidence that such a place exists!We were taken to our room which was a little piece of heaven! Ginormous living area which leads into a giant private swimming pool, not 1 but 2 bedrooms!? all equipped with shower rooms, water features, statues and rose petal baths! The pool is in your own private garden which over looks the jungle where i would stand in awe and watch the monkeys and lizards as I continue to have my camera glued to my hand) There is a generously sized 50-60 inch flat screen in your living area, cappuccino machine and ipod/phone docks in literally every corner of the villa plus god knows what else!! Plus a little seating hut in the garden, should you not want the sunbeds or sofa.At this point i had to pinch myself to check I was actually awake and this was not one of those dreams where you wake up depressed because the dream was in fact 'dreamy'.. but fortunately for me, I was well awake and happy to continue to indulge in such luxury!The restaurant in actually the equivalent of a 2 Michelin star restaurant and omg you can certainly see why, the breakfast was out of this world as well as dinner! you can see why there get queues of people wanting to eat there who are not even staying at the hotel!.. We had the privilege of getting to experience and watch some really fine Balinese dancing during dinner on one of the evenings ...and i mean 'top end' Balinese dancing which made dinner that bit more pleasant too! Once you 'lily pad style hop' across the stream stones into the restaurant and experience their food and witness their style, you can see what all the fuss is about! For example my breathtaking prawns were served on a slate.. original and flawless ajnd you are constantly catered for in the same royalty like way. The swimming pool and bar are are out of this world... just glorious and boast beautiful views of the jungle via the infinity pool and swim up bar, where I got to experience their Long island ice Tea which to my standard was top notch! I can see why this is a honeymooners dream.. the only thing is now I have taken my girlfriend here for a holiday, where on earth am I meant to take her for our honeymoon to top this!?... impossible task?.. i think so!..So yeah I still don't feel this review gives the place enough justice.. it is THAT good!! I will certainly return here one day and i cannot recommend this place enough!.. Make sure you visit, if you do not then this is a massive loss to you!"

","If I could give this place 6 stars, I would!","There are so many positive things to say about this place, I just don't know where to start!We arrived here straight from the airport to be greeted by the team on reception, fresh flowers around our necks, cold drink in hand and chilled face cloth so we were relaxed for check in! The team really do bend over backwards to make your stay perfect for you.The hotel is in a secluded area, amongst paddy fields, just a 2 minute drive from Ubud town centre. The hotel provides free bus service to and from the hotel from 7am to 11pm and are very flexible with drop off and pick up locations.The food in the hotels restaurant is an amazing standard. We had breakfast included in the package and were not disappointed - the staff cater for any needs - we didn't need to ask for anything other than the main menu options but they will help you if you have any specific requirements.There are 25 rooms in the hotel and you will not be let down by any of them. The light, spacious high ceilings just add to the character. The cleaners are fantastic and everything is as you would expect from a 5 star resort.This location is so private, you don't really see the other guests until meal time. The pool is stunning and is located close to the restaurant where the staff are happy to bring food and drink to you throughout the day.You can also dine in your room for $5.00 extra - not that we needed to as the restaurant was never loud or overly busy. The hotel also has live acoustic guitar and piano during dinner a few times a week and the music is very relaxing and adds to the atmosphere.The gym has everything that you will need for your stay and if you are into yoga, we saw a few couples taking yoga classes during the mornings.I really can't say enough good things about this location and I will certainly be coming back here again in the future. This place is a hidden gem in Bali and I highly recommend that you visit."

","Breathtaking","This was my second time in Ubud and first time at Viceroy. Blow me down, this place is luxury jungle paradise within minutes to Ubud town. When it comes to 5 star properties the Viceroy know how to wow. My pool villa was extraordinary, if only it had a kitchen I would quite happily live there. Complete privacy and an outlook that lingers in my memory now I am back amongst the Sydney rat race. This was probably my first resort where the pictures do not reflect the actual live beauty. The gazebo adjacent to the pool was comfortable and enticing. It's been ages since I've read a book and that's exactly what I did in between pool dips. The spa on premise was luxurious with a bath of thousands of petals in the shape of a love heart. It must have taken them ages to prepare this, a thoughtful act I will cherish forever thank you Viceroy management. There are so many other features outside your own pool villa that I wish I had more time to enjoy. A lovely swim up bar, public infinity pool and wonderful restaurant. By the way the breakfast was not only a perfect way of starting the day, but I couldn't believe how well presented the dishes were when they came to the table. Not many people compliment the presentation of breakfast in their reviews, but it was unbelievable, like a creative work of art and much appreciated. What a great chef and team. Dinner was romantic and the lighting perfect. The food was sensational. If you get a chance to stay at Viceroy you are some of the luckiest people in the world. In over 70 counties and 100's of hotels and resorts I've staying the Viceroy is the top of my list. It replaces my previous top resort in the when I was last in Bali 8 years ago. Bali the home of affordable luxury. In Viceroy's case, splash out and enjoy at least 2-3 nights here away from the hustle and bustle of Seminyak. The visions will remain a lifetime. I can not wait to return."

","Heaven On Earth","We booked 5 nights and enjoyed the hotel so much that we were fortunate that the hotel staff was able to squeeze us in for another night. We have stayed at hotels throughout the world, and this hotel is the best overall that we have ever stayed at. Prior to staying here, we stayed at what many describe as the best hotel in Indonesia (St Regis @ Nusa Dua), but despite a superb stay, somehow the Viceroy was able to make us even more happy than the St Regis did. The view is spectacular, the room with a private pool outstanding, and the food perhaps among the best in Indonesia as well. We would hope to return in the near future with other family members. The free service into Ubud is reliable by hotel staff, and they were always able to come and pick us up at a moment's notice. Even more interesting is this hotel is family owned, and was designed by the owners who now have their children involved in the day to day management of the hotel."

","Heavenly hotel! ","We stayed here for 4 nights as the last stop on our honeymoon and it was the perfect ending to the trip of a lifetime. Every detail of this hotel is well considered. The room was luxurious but still fit in beautifully to the natural surroundings. Service was impeccable - the entire staff was warm, friendly, and very helpful. The hotel is a quick 5 minute drive to the amazing town of Ubud and the hotel offers a free shuttle service all day and evening. And the spa was amazing - best massages we got in Bali! The restaurant is very nice, offering a bountiful free breakfast in the morning. Our room had a small private pool but we chose to spend most of our time at the main infinity pool that has a swim up bar and incredible views overlooking the gorge into which the hotel is built. We also really liked the hands on, personal touch of the hotel owners, who were on site throughout our stay and made a point of greeting all the guests. Overall could not have been happier and are dreaming of the day we can return!"

","Above and Beyond","We have just arrived back home to Australia after 3 nights at the Viceroy and what a truly fabulous 3 dayAfter staying in Uluwatu and Seminyak it was welcomed and relaxingThe hotel would rival any 5 star I stay in for work with the added inclusions of truly outstanding professional staffEvery need was catered to , drop offs and pickups from Ubud in stylish vehicle dinner reservations made at restaurants as well as hair appointments!!Only feedback is please update the spa - it is tired and desperately in need of an upgrade commensurate with the rest of the hotel- service was lovely but the majestic view is wasted as you are directed into small clinical roomsThat aside we will definitely be back Thankyou "

","Exceptional","We chose the Viceroy as the place to spend our last few days in Bali. Going by the high praise from Tripadvisor reviewers and the high end price tag, we figured the place would be pretty special and wanted to save the best to last. As with so many previous reviews I will say that our expectations were exceeded, by a very long way! Levels of service from staff across all areas of the hotel are flawless. These guys really know what they're doing. Combine their professionalism with the natural warmth and helpfulness prevalent in so many of the locals we encountered in Bali, and you've got something pretty special. We stayed in a deluxe terrace villa, which was huge, spotless and extremely well appointed. Great bathroom, huge bed, espresso machine, massive flatscreen with plenty of channels, DVD player and a B&W Zeppelin iPod dock (I want one of those at home). The terrace was heaven, with your own private pool and Bale in the sky.Food was brilliant. The Balenese Bennedict at breakfast an awesome reinterpretation of my favourite brunch treat. The a la carte menu was diverse and delicious. I only wish I'd been able to fit more in.The whole hotel manages to feel grand yet intimate. All the communal areas, should you decide to leave your little piece of villa heaven are peaceful, immaculate and beautiful. The views from the villa and hotel are stunning, and sunrise as the mist lifts off the river valley is well worth getting up for. We've stayed in luxury hotels around the world, and my partner and I are in agreement, the Viceroy Bali is the best of them all. A big thanks to the Viceroy team for the last few days of our holiday everything we hoped for and more. Brilliant"

","Best hotel I stayed during my honeymoon","This hotel was my first destination in my honeymoon. After a long trip we arrived at this amazing hotel with our own private pool, big bathroom, and big room. Even though the hotel is amazing, the best part was the service. Everybody was very nice and did everything with a smile on their faces. We took a private tour on our first day and the guy that took us around was the best, his name is Jes/Jess/Yes. If you are going to Ubud, Bali, this is the place to stay."

","Truly relaxing and comfortable place","Villas are extremely specious and comfortable, the private pool was always refreshing. Very good service in all areas of the hotel, staff helpful when needed. I must say we had an extremely nice and relaxing stay, coupled with some visits at interesting places on the island. And the Belgian chef at The Cacades Restaurant is good, one must try it (especially seafood or the beef with some Australian wine :)). Enjoy it!"

","Amazing place - best place to relax","Part of our honeymoon was spent at Viceroy Bali (whole 9 nights). It was the most amazing place ever. We had our own large private villa (Deluxe Terrace Villa) - It was very spacious and had an amazing luxury feel about it. Everything was really luxurious; the room was well designed, nice bed, good TV/sound system (also for smartphone connection), free Wi-Fi, you had 2 sinks, a decent bath and a nice tub (we used the pool mostly though). Outside we had our own private pool witch we first were unsecure was big enough to swim in, but it was actually alright for a few strokes (5x3 meters) - so a decent size for a private pool. Over the pool was a cozy pagoda like place to sit and relax - also a really lovely spot. All in all we felt really at home instantly and felt that we were a very luxurious place at the same time - we stayed here a pretty long time (9 nights), but never really wanted to leave - and when we did for a day trip or to visit Ubud, we always looked forward to returning to the hotel and our villa.The hotel is a smaller one (26 villas if I remember correctly) so it never felt crowded - actually most people was in their own villas, so it was nice and quiet everywhere. The staff was always really helpful and always has a lot of attention of your needs - they helped with everything and always smiled. Top service all aroundThe hotel has a restaurant which is really really good. The breakfast (make sure to get it included! It's worth it!) Is a la carte, but don't worry if your hungry - you can order as much as you want :) Freshly squeezed juices and every dish was delicious - we ate way to much because it was so yummyAt evening the restaurant offered really good food as well - it was however a bit pricy we thought (European standard prices I guess), but the quality was always really good. It's definitely worth a visit, but if you stay here more nights I would recommend visiting one of the many good restaurants in Ubud (use the hotels free transfer service) Other good things- Free airport transfer- The hotel is too far out from Ubud to walk - but the hotel has a nice (free) transfer service to Ubud which worked perfectly. At day you could be set of at certain areas but at night they picked you up everywhere in Ubud - we used this, a couple of times and we never waited more than 15 minutes - super service. - It seems like ½ (at least!) of the people staying at Viceroy are honeymooners - this means quiet, relaxes people in love => a nice quiet romantic atmosphere everywhere - perfect for your own romantic holiday - Friendly and efficient service everywhere - The staff was really good to clean the room while you were eating breakfast.... you never had to wait - it was just done while you were away anyways - perfect! - The fitness area was pretty good as well (for a hotel this size at least)- The spa had a beautiful and romantic flower bath - fun to sit in a tub full of beautiful flowers :)- As honeymooners you get a cute little romantic ""have good honeymoon"" cake at arrival - that was really appreciatedThe only negative thing I can really think about is that the sun wasn't on the terrace of the villa so much. It was there from maybe 9am to 13... So if you really wanted to get a tan you needed to sun some of the time at the common areas - these were however also good, but we would just have loved the sun to be on the villa terrace more time of the day :) But we are talking details now.Also the price level is quite high for Bali, but you can probably guess this when you book :)All in all we had an amazing stay here and were quit sad that we have to leave - the hotel isn't cheap but it was a really amazing, relaxing and luxurious place for our honeymoon - we were really sad to leave and will definably like to return someday"

","Relaxation Guaranteed","My wife and I stayed at the Viceroy last week for three nights and we cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Many hotels profess luxury and perfection but the Viceroy delivers on every level.Excellent accomodation and with an excellent restaurant. We loved this place and will be returning. We found all the staff at the hotel very sincere and work very hard to make your stay perfect.On first arrival we noted that very few people were hanging around the general resort area's. I found out that this is because to villa's are nigh on perfect and we spent most of our three days in ours when we were not checking out Ubud itself.Must also mention the excellent service where the guys will transport you to Ubud and back whenever you wish. We found this service excellent and managed pickups via emails when we could get a wifi signal (which was easy to do as many places have open wifi)Don't even think about it. Book this holiday now!"

","The Viceroy treatment","Having stayed at many resorts around Bali on our 2 week trip, the Viceroy firmly takes pride of place at the top of the list. The dedicated and personal approach to ensure anything you require is catered for is one of the many perks of this great getaway located in the hills. Fantastic food, superb service and a very convenient on demand shuttle service make this a home away from home. We stayed in a garden villa with a private pool which whilst on first impression was seemingly close to others is tactfully segregated to make each villa private and secluded inside and out so you maintaining a feeling the view is yours alone."

","Private, five star luxury in the heart of Ubud","Our honeymoon stay was nothing short of phenomenal. From the immaculate villas to the extraordinary service, facilities and views I could not provide any higher commendation.A private chauffeur is able to take you and pick you up to any local destination, with staff going out of their way to help you find the right tours, cultural experiences and activities should you be interested. I was just blown away at the level of care and service we received, with whichever driver we got asking us about our daily activities and enjoyment.The complimentary morning breakfast at Cascades was also amazing. A wonderful menu and delicious food. We were in heaven.Quiet, classy, private and tranquil with awesome staff and a central location. Just perfect."

","First class service, beautiful location and a very luxurious experience","We enjoyed a superb 6 night stay in the Viceroy. We stayed in an exquisite deluxe terrace villa with a pool and beautiful views over the gorge. We came to Ubud 10 years ago and I was bitten mercilessly by mosquitoes. At the Viceroy I wasn't bitten once and so I think the hotel must be doing a good job of mossie control.The breakfasts were a la carte, varied and delicious. There were a few minor lapses in service which I'd put down to translation. Cascades Restaurant is lauded by the hotel as the finest in Ubud. I think that might be stretching matters a little but the food was very good. We enjoyed a dance performance with our meal on one evening although sadly only with a taped accompaniment rather than live gamelan.We also enjoyed cocktails at the bar overlooking the gorge.The front desk could not have been more helpful both prior to our arrival and during our stay and we appreciated the free shuttle to Ubud in the evenings and the reasonably priced hotel car service to places outside the central Ubud area. We had a wonderful tour to Kintamani, Tegallalung, a coffee plantation, Pura Tirta Empel and Goa Gajah with one of the hotel drivers, Chess. We were able to tailor-make the tour according to our precise specification and Chess provided an informative commentary throughout the tour. We also enjoyed a few hours of pampering in the spa although with hindsight perhaps the ""male"" spa package was a little too effeminate for my husband! I would love to go back to this hotel again."

","A luxury retreat with an amazing staff!","Our stay in Ubud will remain one of those fantastc moments you keep in mind for a lifetime - mostly thanks to The Viceroy team who made it amazing. The hotel is a very peaceful and luxurious retreat with very nice views on a valley and its river. The deluxe vila we occupied (#15) had a private pool and very enjoyable Balé. We found the room very well appointed. The hotel is charming, and restaurant CasCades delicious. The staff is gracious and welcoming. We also did a half day tour and had good time with our driver - MAGA - who we found very passionate. He showed us many temples and nice places around, with excellent explanations. We just headed back to Seminyak today and - again - experienced the professionalism and great friendliness of our smilee driver DWI. Thank you Guys for making our stay such a nice one!"

","Luxurious stay - simply the best Ubud has to offer","We have stayed at the Viceroy 3 times in the last 18 months and have aleady booked our next stay for later this year. This hotel meets the desires of the most discerning traveller. Every facet of its operation is geared towards perfection - the wonderful staff who greet you by name, the room fitout, the bed linen, the heated plunge pools, the gorgeous gardens, the facilities generally. The food is simply delicious. Despite having travelled the world staying in 5 star hotels , I have no hesitation in declaring the breakfasts at the Vice Roy as incomparable. The problem for us is that we believe we have experienced the best Ubud has to offer ...and are now loathe to even trial anywhere else. Aah well - that will be our fate - to return to the Vice roy time after time after time."

","Very good but not outstanding","The resort benefits from its location on a steep hillslope which allows a breathtaking view from every villa. The villas themselves are really spacious with tasteful furniture/interior details and all the modern facilities you expect nowadays. The restaurant is located on the top of the resort, so wonderful views during all meals. Staff of the hotel as in the restaurant was always very friendly and courteous.Areas of improvement:- Cleanliness: glasses and cups in the room were not really clean. It seems that the daily cleaning is done in the room's sink rather than in a dishwasher- Restaurant: while food is basically good, the dishes are small and even considering the good quality clearly over-priced - Customer Service: 1.) If you pay at least USD 600,- ++ per night it's more than fussy that they charge you USD 1,- for a stamp (!)2.) The hotel's rates for trips and airport transfers are too high compared with other hotels of this standard within Indonesia"

","Wow. Expectations blown away","My husband and I stayed at the Viceroy for 4 nights to complete the balinese leg of our honeymoon. I had read about the Viceroy extensively before booking it so my expectations were really high - and they were absolutely exceeded. We were picked up in Seminyak and I was beyond ill....not sure what it was from but I felt like death when I arrived. The driver on the way could not have taken better care of me - I later found out he has worked for the hotel for 15 years and LOVES it... I think all of the staff do and its part of their secret :). When I arrived the rest of the staff quickly escorted me to my room and then even the chef (who is FABULOUS) made me chicken soup and anything else I wanted to calm my tummy. When I finally woke up feeling better, I then was shocked by the majestic beauty of the Viceroy. It was amazing. Our private pool was fantastic and the room was beautiful.... Unfortunately, my husband was then ill as well but the hotel was great yet again and took phenomenal care of him too.... And when we werent ill, we explored.... and the hotel staff made great recommendations and suggestions so that we saw 'their' Bali and not just the experiences in the brochures. The driver that had taken such good care of me also drove us around for an afternoon and brought us into a temple, explained the significance of different areas etc - he was PHENOMENAL. If you go, you must go out for an afternoon with him!Now, we normally venture out to eat at least a few times - the restaurant here was so good, we didnt want to.... I would highly recommend it! So, even though Bali is quite a long way away, my husband and I are both already talking about when we can go back to visit the Viceroy. It honestly doesnt get better than this!"

","Almost perfect!","We had part of our honeymoon here and it was fantastic. The setting is awesome and it is genuinely luxurious. Our villa and private pool was beautiful and immaculate. They also turned the temperature of the pool up on request which was lovely. The couples spa session we had was amazing , best we'd ever had. The free shuttle service in and out of Ubud was really useful and convenient. The staff sorted out any issues we had straight away and were always welcoming, friendly and attentive. To be exceptionally picky we were surprised on our last night when we got back to the hotel at about 11:05pm to be told the bar was closed. A mild annoyance but we got a couple of glasses of wine to take to the room (disaster averted)! It also got odd towards the end of our stay when we started to get phone calls and knocks on the door asking when they will be able to clean/turn down the room. Surprising when at the start they miraculously did it when we were out which we thought was a great touch. However, this place is amazing and we loved it. Best hotel we've ever stayed at. Thoroughly recommend!!!"

","High expectations.....exceeded!","Within minutes of arrival I knew we had made the right choice. The awards for Best Small Luxury Hotel in Asia and Best Luxury Hotel of Bali hanging in reception seem well-deserved. Terrace Villa; luxurious AND spectacular. You pay for the best and that's what you get. Al a carte breakfast was divine. Extra entree; no problems! Filled us up. Spending a day on the grounds of the hotel was beautiful and relaxing. Taking the on-call shuttle into Ubud was easy and effective for getting around. Staff were discreet and respectful. One thing that was a little strange, on one night as we were getting ready for dinner the staff came to perform the evening turn-down while we were in the Villa. Uncomfortable, but only briefly. On other nights they always seemed to time it perfectly to coincide with us being out of the room. If the main pool and the villa pool were a couple of degrees warmer it would've been absolutely perfect. Ah, if only. There's nothing like spending hours in a warm pool. Was unfortunate that 10mins in either pool was about all we could handle. I've read some negative reviews of Cascades restaurant and I can't understand them as our experience was perfect. Yes it's not cheap but it's true 5 star dining and a great experience. Just forget the bill, after all, it's a holiday and a true Bali luxury escape. We'll see you again Viceroy. Flights booked already for 2015."

","Amazing place! Would stay there again for sure","Friendly staffAmazing food (pricey but it is worth it)The views are amazing from everywhere you lookI saw monkeys while I was having breakfast with my husband It's not walking distance from the centre of Ubud and there is nothing around the hotel for you to eat or shop but they offer a shuttle car service at your request anytime until 11pm they pick you up from the hotel and back at the time you wish so that's very convenient. The breakfast is not the traditional buffet breakfast as you order from the menu but you can eat as much as you want you just need to order what you want and they bring it to you. If you don't feel like waiting at the restaurant they charge $5 and take the breakfast to your room. This place is the best from the best is bali. The only thing is the pool it is freezing cold so sadly I couldn't enjoy it as much and the pool from my villa was cold too :( this place would be 100% perfect just with heated pools other than that nothing else to fault. I would definitely stay here again!"

We followed our stay with two other reputable luxury hotels, but none came close to the level of service, competence, value, and attention to detail. The food and drinks at Cascades were also lovely...we had wonderful breakfasts, dinners, etc. We also had a heavenly couples spa treatment. I would endure another 26 hour journey from the US in a heartbeat to come back to the Viceroy. Thank you for making our honeymoon something incredible!"

","The best hotel in Indonesia!","This hotel is amazing in every aspect possible! From the moment I was picked up at the airport to the moment I left the hotel, I could not have asked for more. The villas are luxurious, clean and quiet! The owners are Australian and always happy to have a chat and make sure you are being spoilt! Staff are also friendly and very helpful. I have done a lot of travelling in Indonesia and stayed at the a lot of the best hotels, but the Viceroy is by far my favourite. My last stay at the Viceroy was my third visit and I wouldn't stay anywhere else!"

","Simply a Great Hotel in Bali ...","We stayed at the Viceroy as a break from the Villa we rented in Jimbaran .... I am so pleased we made the effort to visit Ubud and the Viceroy....a wonderful reprieve from surf central!I am always slightly cautious when taking our 5 year old to hotels that are so slanted towards romantic couples but there was nothing to worry about. The Villas are extraordinary.... due to being so popular we had two different rooms on our visit. The first was the Garden Villa (1650 sf) ... very luxurious, with an indoor plunge pool, which was a huge hit with our daughter. we then moved up two categories to a Deluxe Terrace which was the same size but newer with a different layout....and of course, equally as enjoyable.The food is also noteworthy, there is well produced local dishes but the european cuisine is worth considering. My wife had fish, my daughter chicken and I had a medley of local dishes...all very good. We were not drinking but there was an extensive wine list and cocktail menu. Breakfast is prepared or cooked fresh, so may take a little longer than a normal buffet. However, the food is delivered when ready, so if you want your fruit first, order your eggs when the water melon and mango arrives. The whole place has been carefully designed by the owner, Otto and his wife, Margaret. It is a well run family business which has the benefit of having the owners eye being on site....but not in an obtrusive way. Their daughter (Amanda) was a huge help with our short trip.. her suggestions and ideas maximised our stay. If time is of the essence, I would recommend the services of a guide. We used Putu from mikeputubalitour@hotmail.com I wish we had stayed an extra night and travelled to the volcano and lakes a little further north.I wish the Syrowatka Family all the best for the future.NB ... If you are in search of some healthy eating options I would suggest Clear Cafe which offers some quite unique vegan, raw and fish food and juices."

","Great boutique hotel","Stunning location in a river valley with lush vegetation all around, villas are beautiful and of very generous proportions with a wonderful bathroom and an heated private pool outside. All kept to a very high standard of cleanliness. The view from the room, spa and restaurant alike are nothing but breathtaking, especially in the morning sun. Spa offered very good massages and the restaurant prepares good dishes, service is very friendly and helpful at all times. Transfer to ubud free of charge was very good as well.Only small negative was price of some extras compared to going rates outside the hotel, but nothing that should prevent from appreciating the sheer beauty of the place and surroundings."

","Wonderful","If you really want to rest and renew yourself, you should come to Ubud. We selected Viceroy due to amazing comments in tripadvisor and now i understood why people like this hotel. First of all, hotel has an amazing arhitecture, they considered every detail even while constructing. We stayed in villa and it was so comfortable and had amazing jungle view. you can just sit, rest in a small sitting area in the balcony and sleep while listening birds and other sounds coming from the jungle. Restaurant was amazing. i am impressed by the chef. i tasted many dishes there and all were amazing. All people working there were very nice and talkative but they dont bother you too. Only one negative thing that i can say (but this is not their fault) is that you shouldnt forget you are in the mountain. Although Viceroy thought every details and took actions but nevertheless, you can easily see some small (not dangerous) animals like lizards or ants. i think you need to consider that we are their guest in their jungle. This hotel is not cheap but definetly value for money!!"

","Dream come true!","Well, what can I say... words cannot express how you feel at Viceroy Bali. It is just amazing. We are just back from our honeymoon and I have never felt so relaxed! Our days started with a beautiful breakfast and an awesome view. We basically had everything on the menu on the last day! The yoghurt and sumbawa honey was my favourite. We spent days in our private pool and balé spotting monkeys in the valley across! Sometimes we ventured into Ubud itself. We noticed a lot of guests came for a short time and went on to somewhere else in Bali. We spent two weeks in Ubud at the Viceroy and we are so glad that we did. Ubud is so beautiful and even though there are lots of tourists, it does not feel too ""touristy"". Then in the evening we went to the bar for cocktails at sunset looking out to Bali's highest peak. We took a day trip one day with the wonderful Gama. This is totally worth it. He is great fun and very informative. He made us appreciate the Balinese culture even more. He also picked us up and dropped us off at the airport (a real luxury service) so he really became a good friend. All of the staff became like family there. I have never seen such extreme team work before in every process, from cleaning the room to presenting breakfast.We had some lovely dinners at the hotel including one romantic candlelight dinner (they know how to do honeymoons!). The chocolate fondant is a must for chocolate lovers... I had it every time! We also had a great couples treatment that I would totally recommend near the start of the holiday to get you on track for pure relaxation!I really cant say enough about the place and we would definately go back there again. Our dreams really did come true."

","Fantastic","My wife and I has stay there for 2 nights and it is not enough. We have booked ourself onto the Garden Pool Villa Room. The Ubud area is nice and not so busy as the nua dua area. (Although on the first day arrival, it takes us almost 1.5 hour to reach there because of traffic jam and the distance).We have tried to use all the hotel facilities including the swimming pool, gym, reading room, the restruant, spa but most importantly the room and bed is fantastic and it would be so relaxing. The staff are all friendly greeting us and try to bring the details well thought. They have decorated the room as honeymoon couple with welcome cake and also flowers in our own bath.We also tried on the last day to go for a half day tour and to our suprise the visit to rice paddle, volcano, trying out the bali coffee and tea is all amazing and well arranged. The weather in Bali is quite unpredictable but still we do have a few sunshine and the experience is great!We would sure re-visit this hotel in future. (Stay in July 2014)"

","Engagement in heaven!","Viceroy Bali in Ubud is an amazing place to stay. It is a place where things are done with perfection.Viceroy Bali is tucked away in the jungle with peaceful surroundings and stunning infinity views. Our villa itself had a super king sized bed with the best linen bedding imaginable, a perfect spacious bathroom, a large outdoor seating area and an awesome infinity pool overlooking the valley with a beautiful Bale to lounge. It was probably one of the best setups I've ever seen. The amenities were top!The food in the restaurant was excellent. I was lucky to meet the Chef - Nic is his name - in person to congratulate him. As this stay was an engagement stay, (luckily she said yes) Nic made a special and unique tasting menu with all the dishes my fiancée loves. This dinner was served in the privacy of our villa and now destined to be one of the most memorable nights of our lives.All the staff are very accommodating, helpful, efficient and kind. Anything you asked was done in the blink of an eye. Several of the hotel staff remembered our names and greeted us throughout the day when we passed them. It made for a magical atmosphere. Viceroy Bali is a sight to behold and you really hate leaving for any reason; however, sooner or later you have to come back down to Earth."

","Another wonderful stay at the Viceroy!","Our family recently completed our second stay at the Viceroy. We simply cannot speak highly enough about this resort. As a family of 5 (2 adults and 3 teenagers) we took 2 Deluxe Terrace Villa's, parents in one and children in the other. The Villa's are separate so provide privacy and are connected via a large door in the outside courtyards. We would thoroughly recommend this setup for a family. As usual the rooms were absolutely immaculate with everything you would want at your fingertips. The beds are huge and very comfortable. Since our last stay in 2012 the food at Cascades restaurant has got even better. Breakfast is great and dinner was absolutely superb. We ate dinner at Cascades each night for the 3 nights we were there and were blown away each night by the presentation and taste of the meals. Another really great part of a stay at the Viceroy is the staff. Without exception staff members are polite, always willing to assist, like to get to know you as a person / family and seem genuinely pleased and privileged to be part of the Viceroy 'family'. We also had a number of very interesting chats with Otto, the owner of the hotel and very much appreciated his hospitality. Aside from the great rooms, spectacular food and the staff the highlight of the stay was a bicycle ride, hosted by one of the staff through the beautiful Ubud country side. We rode through villages and rice paddies, seeing a side of Bali that was special and different to the usual tourist sites. We would recommended making this a must on any visit to the Viceroy. So......all up another great stay at a truly wonderful resort....we would recommend Viceroy with hesitation to anyone thinking of staying."

","Beautiful Villa, Stunning View","I can't rave about The Viceroy enough. The staff were so friendly and accommodating, always smiling and asking how our day was. Breakfast was delicious. Entree sized dishes meant we could try a few things off the menu - citrus crepes are a must! The Deluxe Terrace Villa was immaculate, beautiful marble floors throughout. It's the kind of villa you can't help but take photos of as soon as you walk in the door. I was travelling with my mum and we both overpack so it was nice to have enough space in the room to unload our toiletries and hang up our clothes. The private villa pool was heated and we spent most evenings sitting back with a glass of bubbles gazing over the valley. We visited the spa twice opting to have one of our massages outside under a marquee surrounded by flowers and valley views. Such a peaceful way to unwind. No stress about getting to the main pool area early to snag a day bed as the entire time we were there it felt as though we had the place to ourselves. Big shout out to Obama of Ubud who treated us like VIP's the entire time we were there :)! A truly magnificent resort. Can't wait to come back."

","Beautiful Luxury Resort","My husband and I recently stayed at the Viceroy Bali for the first 2 nights of our honeymoon. We arrived in the middle of the night very tired from hours of flying and was greeted by Dewa at the front desk. He was extremely kind and professional and put us in our room immediately. We stayed in the Deluxe Terrace Villa #1. When he opened the door to our villa our mouths dropped in awe! The room is gorgeous and spacious with modern amenities. There is also a terrace with our very own plunge pool, sun bathing chairs, and balinese bale for relaxing. They also decorated our room in celebration of our honeymoon and provided us with a delicious ""Happy Honeymoon"" cake. That was a very sweet touch to our wonderful stay. The complimentary breakfast at the resort was amazing! There was a mix of western meals and Indonesian, along with different pastries, coffees and teas. The resort also provided a complimentary shuttle service that allowed us to explore Ubud. Thank you Viceroy for getting our honeymoon on a great start!"

","The most beautiful hotel not just in UBUD but in Bali...","My husband and I stayed at this beautiful boutique hotel during our time in Ubud, bali. I can't express enough how beautiful this hotel is, how professional and friendly the staff is and how lovely the owners are. Let me start by the hotel itself. As you enter, you are greeted by a smile, a glass of yummy iced tea and a frangipani necklace... You don't know what's expecting you until you pass the lobby and suddenly realize that you're in heaven... The view of the lush forest in front of you, the floating gazebo and the infinity pool give you a true image of paradise... such a romantic place..This hotel has 25 villas, with a beautiful design in every single type of rooms... What I love about this place the most was the attention to details and the little touches here and there... The flower bathtub they make for you upon request, the little flowers left by housekeeping everywhere and the lovely, authentic design of the private villas as well as the public areas. The rooms are so beautiful you don't even want to leave your villa!!!This hotel is owned by a lovely family whom eventually will come and get to know you personally. The professional and well mannered staff in the CasCades will call you by your first name every morning and greet you with smile... They will go out of your way to make your stay a memorable one... This is a boutique five-store resort where you feel right at home... definitely doesn't have a corporate feel which we love the most in the places we choose to stay at...Our driver during our one-day tour arranged by the hotel was Magri. A very well-mannered and knowledgeable fellow who showed us the true Bali. We thoroughly enjoyed our visits to temples with him. On the way to the airport, our driver was Made, a young lively Balinese guy with a cheerful spirit. He made the 1.5 drive to the airport a very enjoyable one...Breakfast is very delicious... fresh juices & tasty dishes. from the Crepe to the omelettes and the coconut rice pudding... To die for...Thank you, Otto, Margaret and your wonderful staff for making our stay in Ubud an amazing one... we will be back very soon..."

The front desk will take you in to downtown Ubud at the drop of a hat, and pick you up whenever you are ready. The Monkey forest is a must!!A special thanks to Kadek Dwi, he is an absolute gem of an employee!! He dropped us off in Ubud center and drove us to the most amazing rice fields and temples.....not to mention finding us the most beautiful hand carved door company for our one of a kind bathroom door!!!!

","Amazing holiday experience!","I have just had the most beautiful 3 nights at the Viceroy Bali with my sister and 4 of our cousins. Wow did they look after us! From our first walk down those steps into the resort, we knew we were in for a treat! Our accommodation was magnificent, truly first class and the resort was absolutely beautiful. The breakfasts were amazing, served by dedicated and friendly staff. The pool, the lounge, the boutique and the grounds were simply superb. This resort is run by a very professional and friendly family. Nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff at the resort. Our drivers were informative and friendly, particularly the girls' favourite, Mr Obama. We explored Ubud and went to some lovely restaurants during our stay, so my only regret was not dining at the wonderful restaurant in the Viceroy, we simply ran out of time - I will just have to return one day."

","Gorgeous Villas, Superb Dining","The Viceroy Bali is a very, very nice resort near Ubud and I am tempted to give it a 5-star rating... but as a solo traveler I must give it 4 stars. This is a very romantic honeymoon resort on a safe, private compound. Even the lowest-tier Garden Villas are absolutely stunning. The dining at Cascades Restaurant is superb. The staff is friendly and attentive. But they're just not quite sure what to do with a solo traveler. Perhaps this could be a future opportunity for the Viceroy? A mixer promotion for like-minded single travelers? I would return for that.The town of Ubud can be rather hectic and although it is definitely worth seeing, it is nice to return to the quiet and luxurious calm of the Viceroy at the end of the day. There is nothing wrong with sitting by the pool all day, either. I enjoyed that one day, writing in my journal and sipping cocktails.The dining is really a highlight. The executive chef (a Belgian fellow) has really honed his craft. Whether you choose the Indonesian sampler, the Degustation menu, or individual entrees, you are in for a real treat.It's hard to imagine that there is a nicer resort than the Viceroy in Ubud. If you are a couple looking for a romantic getaway, look no further."

","Stunningly set and very well run small luxury hotel","The genius of this hotel is how the architect has used the location on the side of a valley to create stunning public areas and for all the rooms uninterrupted views and great privacy. This is a small luxury retreat hotel and it fulfils the role beautifully. Staff are excellent and nothing is too much trouble. I particularly liked the hotel providing what amounts to a free taxi service around the local area. The management have very wisely decided not to sweat the small stuff (which annoys luxury travellers) and make sure you are provided with bottled water/milk/coffees/loads of towels etc without any aggravating extra charges..Restaurant is very decent with a relatively small selection of dishes at reasonable prices considering the quality. High tea in the afternoon is done very nicely.This is not a family focussed hotel it's more a romantic couples place but the staff were very kid friendly and took the time to help entertain our energetic 6 year old, making paper birds/planes and even helping him fly a home-made kite with local kids.I can't imagine anyone being disappointed by a visit here."

","wonderful experience","We went to the Viceroy in Ubud for our honey moon, and I have to say it was one of the most fantastic experiences i have ever had. First, the Lobby experience is so unique that you can't help but be awe-struck from the second you enter the hotel. A buggy then takes you to your villa, we stayed in a 1-bedroom villa with a private pool. The villa itself is beautiful, spacious and retains the cozy element. The view from the villa is phenomenal, I cannot recommend it enough! The staff are so extremely helpful and nice. Anything you need, they are there to help. the hotel also provides shuttles into ubud, which is an amazing town/city with lots to see and do. the shuttles are, of course, nice luxurious vans that seat up to 6 people. the hotel is very quite, so don't expect your shuttle to be filled with people. The hotel also has a wonderful restaurant, which were we chose to have our breakfast every day right next to the superb pool with the jaw-dropping view. the food is fantastic, I implore you to at least dine once there. our trip to Bali was fantastic, we stayed in several hotels throughout our stay .. but i have to say the Viceroy takes the cake home."

","Heavenly honeymoon at Viceroy","This resort was a hidden treasure. I was very surprised when we found this stunning resort in the small town of Ubud. The villa 6 was gorgeous. We had a massive bed with romantic netting. We we're on our honeymoon and they'd set up roses and candy for us. The bathroom, pool and day bed are all open to the outdoors but our bedroom was enclosed with air conditioning and living area where we had breakfast in the morning. The food was great but a bit pricey so we didn't eat there often. But the staff is wonderfully friendly and accommodating and speak English very well. It was a heavenly honeymoon."

","Luxury room, great breakfast, friendly staff","We just got back from an around the world honeymoon and the Viceroy Bali was our chosen hotel in Ubud. My choice for this hotel came solely on other reviews of the hotel. It was a great choice for a romantic location in Ubud. We had the hotel driver pick us up at Denpasar. He arrived in a traditional Balinese outfit. He was a lovely chap and taught us about Balinese culture on the 1.5 hr drive to the hotel. Arriving at the hotel, the staff were just as friendly as Kadek. The property is on the side of a hill looking into lush landscape. It is really breathtaking. My favorite view was from the restaurant, The Cascades. When deciding on what room to reserve, I went back and forth between the garden vs the deluxe terrace. In the end, we decided the garden suite looked beautiful. Either way, these rooms are fantastic. They are huge- I mean as large as our home in the USA. With equally large outdoor space as indoor space. They are equipped with many details. The staff prepared a fresh rose bath for us, twice, during our stay. Really this hotel is everything you can dream about. As a mosquito magnet, this hotel must do a great job of spraying because I didn't have a problem at all- even in the pool at night. This hotel only has 25 rooms, so the service is exemplary. The gym is wonderful and they have a nice library of books and dads, for a night in.Coming from my discerning foodie husband, ""Cascades was the best breakfast I've ever had."" They include a three course breakfast as part of the night stay. The dinner was also wonderful at Cascades, but on the expensive side. We chose to eat dinner in the restaurant once, and in our room once. Food was great. Our one complaint- the spa prices. We were planning to have many spa treatments, but the price was just too much more expensive than going into Ubud. We even went as far as contacting the nearest hotel, which was $30 cheaper than Viceroy. Town prices are $80 cheaper than the hotel prices. During our stay, the spa was empty most of the time, with almost all of the guests couples, I didn't understand why this was the case when I'm sure most were wanting to keep their money at the hotel. I'd be willing to pay a little more than town based on atmosphere, but not 4 times as much. Prices need to be reviewed. Also, there is a free shuttle to and from the center of Ubud. Great service!"

","Landed in paradise!","We landed in Bali on our first wedding anniversary and as soon as we entered the Viceroy we were speechless. The hotel was small, private, quiet and the backdrop of the Viceroy was nothing short of amazing. We were taken to our garden villa which was incredible - beautiful views, clean, very modern and luxurious. To our delight my brother had arranged a surprise anniversary dinner for my husband and I.The hotel had made this experience unforgettable, they had a arranged a private 5 course dinner and we were seated in a secluded gazebo which had been decorated with candles and flowers! The menu had been specially printed for us and we received a complimentary anniversary cake! The staff were so helpful and always polite - nothing was ever too much trouble for them. Cascades restaurant food was the best food we ate in Bali. We popped out to Ubud town centre for a couple of nights to try the local restaurants but soon regretted not eating at the hotel! We even ate the Four Seasons and even their food did not compare to Cascades at the Viceroy. Throughout our stay we would get a small complimentary dessert to celebrate our anniversary. My ONLY improvement for the restaurant would be to have more of a variety of dishes - maybe a set of specials every night. This would probably have made my husband and I eat there every night. The complimentary shuttle service is brilliant, you will be dropped off and picked up from Ubud centre at your request.We stayed here for 6 nights and wished we could have stayed longer... will we back? 100% yes!"

","Luxurious villas, beautiful location, delicious food and superb staff","We stayed in a deluxe pool villa and it was sensational. Large, luxurious with everything you could want at hand.The staff could not be more accommodating or welcoming. Nothing is too much trouble for them.The food? Read my review of Cascades restaurant. This place stands on its own. It's not just a dining area in a hotel...it's a gastronomic delight. (Breakfast alone is an amazing treat)There are only 25 villas on site, so the level of attentiveness is very personal. You are not just another guest here. Their motto is if you're not happy for ANY reason...pick up the phone and call someone. You'll always find one of the owners on site and he/she will make sure they know who you are and that you are satisfied.As a smaller venue, they put on extra entertainment for the guests in the form of music, wine matched dinners and local dancers. They seem to aim to only display the best in class (the primary Balinese dancer who appeared when we were there has received numerous awards and teaches dance at the highest level)There's regular shuttles, but the drivers are more than happy to drop you to any venue in Ubud and collect you when finished.We had a brilliant time and will be back."

","Paradise!!!","My husband and I stayed here for the second part if our honeymoon and what an absolutely amazing, breathtaking place this was!We stayed in deluxe terrace 16 which was right at the bottom of the hotel but had such magnificent views of the rainforest. We had a fruit tree right outside next to our bale which would attract wild monkeys, it was great. (The monkeys are scared of you though so if you make a noise they scurry off so just sit back and watch them quietly)The quality and attention to detail paid in the room is second to none. Absolutely beautiful. The only negative thing I can say about this villa is that its at the wrong angle for lots of sunlight so we did most our sunbathing up top in the main pool..but thats definitely not a bad thing anyways!Staff were so attentive and friendly, they made our stay even more enjoyable.Viceroy Bali is definitely a place I would love to come back to if visiting Bali again."

","breathtakingly beautiful","Upon entering the impossibly beautiful Viceroy Hotel, I was in the first part speechless. The first thing that you take in the quintessential, yet elaborate Balinese style buildings nestled effortlessly into the natural surrounding environment. The tropical valley and babbling river as the hotel's backdrop instils a aura of calmness and relaxation. In short of more appropriate words, the hotel is simply perfect.The friendly, professional and unimposing staff provide everything expected of a world class holiday destination. The luxury villa that we stayed in was stunning, modern, opulent and exotic. The tranquil surrounds offered by the opposing valley and faraway volcanoes were spectacular and it felt like you were light years away from the hustle and bustle that can be Bali. As evening descended upon the villa while enjoying a refreshing beverage, fireflies emerged from the shrubbery below, it is as if nature was putting on private show for us. A complementary driving service to town for dinner and drinks topped the evening off. The CasCades restaurant was the next stop for brunch after a sleep in. The quality food and beverage service was as good, if not better than any other service that we had experienced in Bali. The location of the Viceroy is close to the numerous attractions of the Ubud region, world renowned for its charm.Unfortunately, we were only together at the beautiful Viceroy for one night and despite this I had easily the best time that I had on my holiday in Bali and perhaps any holiday that I have been on. It is not hard to recommend the Viceroy to any traveller that wishes to have one of the most amazing holiday experiences."

","Abolutely perfect!","This will be a review full of superlatives but I am not exaggerating - it was paradise! We had only three days in Bali - the Viceroy made them perfect!This is an amazing place - secluded luxury where stress and tension melt. From the meet and greet at the airport to the escort to our villa in Ubud with its views of the forest and totally private pool our introduction to Bali was perfect. The villa was so luxurious that it was a struggle to leave it for long enough to see something of Ubud and it surroundings. However, the car and driver (a delight!) supplied by the hotel meant that we saw as much as we could manage and were able to sample a little Balinese culture and eat at different local restaurants (although the food and service at the hotel was very good it is also nice to try local places - some of which a very inexpensive)It's not cheap but we are so glad we chose to stay there."

The staff were really friendly. It's away from it all. Perfect to wind down. The shuttle in and out of Ubud was a great addition.The pillows were the best pillows I have ever slept on in my entire life."

","Very Nice","I liked this hotel very much. So much attention to details. We stayed in a Deluxe terrace villa.Our room was extremely well appointed. If I had to find a fault I would say that due to direction and size there isn't much sun bathing space, or sun in the afternoon. The food in the restaurant was good and the service spot on. We were really shocked when we arrived and the pool was empty. They had an ""emergency"". but they still did not contact us and we booked through the hotel. Any warning is better than none. We came back after it was open again and had a swim. They should have bought us the bottle of wine, but they didn't. I'm not sure if I'd stay there again. There is a lot of high end compitition in the area…"

","Heaven found","From arrival to departure this was a amazing experience of the senses. Jaws literally dropped at how beautiful our villa was as we arrived late one evening. Jaws dropped again as we opened our doors wide to our stunning private pool and the unspoiled greenery of the gorge beyond. Impeccable service. Stunning food. The friendliest staff. Quality at every turn. Expensive but definitely worth it."

","The staff are amazing!","We stayed at the viceroy last May. The hotel is immaculate! rooms serviced twice a day. the room was spacious and beautiful with its own infinity pool. We over looked a forest with some local monkeys keeping us entertained on the other side of the valley. The restaurants food and service is to die for not to mention the beautiful location. What really made this stay special was the staff! nothing was too much trouble and they made holiday really something to remember. The hotel in itself is a holiday!!!"

","A little piece of heaven.","The Viceroy has to be one of the best hotels in Bali. The energy is beautiful, the staff are wonderful and the location is private and tucked away. The city center is only 2 km away, so you are not far from anything. The pool villas are spectacular, intimate, with amazing views.I have stayed in many luxury 5 star properties around the world and this property now is one of my favorites."

","What a fantantastic place to stay!","We stayed at Viceroy for 3 Nights and it was the most beautiful hotel we have ever stayed in. The location is very special, overlooking the forest and the villas were just so nice with beautiful furniture. We stayed in the Deluxe Terrace Villa, which is 150 sqare meters, it was awesome! The food was great, and they had the best a la carte breakfast. The staff was amazing, they were so nice. One of them (think his name was Gama) took us for at guided tour for 4 hours to see the holy spring water temple, rice terrasse and the vulcano. He really made this trip special. Viceroy also have a free shuttle/pick-up service to and from Ubud for their guests, that was really great too. This place is even more beautiful than the pictures you find on the internett. We would give it 6 stars if it was possible! You will not be dissapointet if you choose to stay here."

","Heaven in Ubud. Luxury at its best.","Incredibly extravagant and over the top hotel that I have ever been to. We selected this little gem as the first stop for our honeymoon and stayed at the Deluxe Terrace Pool Villa. The great thing about this resort is that it is a small secluded resort in Ubud comprised of private pool villas. The villas are gorgeous and spacious. The rooms, the bathroom, pool area is a sight to behold.The staff was generous from the start and impeccable in their services. The resort is heavy on your pocket but once you get here you know there is no substitute to ultimate luxury. The setting of the resort is just amazing that you see this huge valley fall down in front of your private pool and the lush green landscape is staring right back at you and there is no noise and no distraction. Its just sheer opulence.Even the main pool in itself is breath taking. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. Probably the best in Bali. The hotel has a little shuttle service they provide near the Ubud market that we used once to around idyllic shopping. The only thing that I would recommend is adding more vegetarian options to the food menu. The main pool, the rooms, the private pool with gazebo are outstanding. Thank you Viceroy Bali, for making my stay unforgettable."

","Bliss","Fantastic in every way. It begins with our perfect driver Nova meeting us at the airport and answering all our queries whilst revealing interesting anecdotes on the way. Our deluxe terrace villa was jaw dropping awesome. For once I didn't feel like leaving the villa even to sightsee (very unlike me). The little outdoor pergola over the infinity pool was the perfect place to chill. The restaurant offered very good food and though initially we thought the selection for breakfast was small (compared to the buffets in most 5 star), the quality and service was exemplary. Chef Nic is definitely doing a great job. The only small complaint we have is the absence of fans and AC in the restaurant area which would have helped on a few very hot and humid days. Overall the service is efficient and heartfelt. Special mention to Agung, Widiasa and Pande who made the best drinks!!"

","Wonderful way to start our honeymoon!","From the moment the Margi picked us up at the airport, we loved this place. Margi was not only our driver from the airport, but also took us on a tour one day to a local temple, coffee plantation, rice fields and volcano. He did a wonderful job of making us feel comfortable, explaining everything he could and he truly made our stay at the Viceroy even better (if that is possible)!Now into the details...we had the deluxe terrace villa and the view overlooking the forest with our private pool and so much privacy was awesome! This place is 5 star all the way. We travel a lot, and we simply cannot recommend this place enough if you plan to stay in Ubud.The rooms are enormous with a lot of privacy. The room service is awesome and very welcomed after our 30 hour journey from Chicago to Bali. The breakfast in the morning was very good and we arranged a special honeymoon dinner one night which was great as well. They arranged flower petals and candles and a special honeymoon cake for us which made us feel very special.Hands down, don't even look anywhere else. Stay here!"

","Unforgettable honeymoon –蜜月之选","Enough have been said but how good the Viceory is but I want to add more! Me and my husband spent two days here for our honeymoon and we were upgraded to the Deluxe Terrance Villa. The villa itself is so spacious and I really appreciate the traditional Balinese ceiling once I lay down on the huge bed. The privacy or the pool and floating gazebo is exactly want you needed during the honeymoon. Having breakfast at the restaurant while enjoying the morning lush view across the valley was simply heaven. The food at restaurant is amazing and service is just superb. All the villas have similar views but if you do not mind walking a few more steps, I’d recommend villas in the lower level where you will not overlook the top of lower level villas if you stay at the top level (close to the reception/spa/public pool and restaurant)."

","One of The Best Best Honeymoon Place!!!","Reason I choose Ubud and Viceroy because I want to experience the unforgetable-tranquil-romantic journey. And it turned out to be an exceptional experience. Wanted to cry in the last day (want to stay here forever!)Spacious Room (we stayed in Deluxe Terrace Villa). Incredible ambiance. Very tranquil and peace.Very recommended for couples/person who not wanting to leave the resort.The Cascades Restaurant serves an exceptional food; French with Asian twist (love the various kind of Ratatouille; Asian and Mediterranean). For breakfast they don't have buffet so we can order everything that we want in a fresh condition (in love with the rice pudding with coconut milk and Mango Trifle)I also enjoyed the spa in Lembah Spa. Very recommended.They also have free shuttle to the centre of Ubud. Also Airport pick up and drop off service.The staff, manager and everyone there were friendly, always smile and polite. Definitely first class service."

","Exceeded Our Expectations","My sister and I just came back from a fabulous 3 night stay at the Viceroy and I must say, the resort exceeded our expectations. We booked a terrace villa but was upgraded to a deluxe terrace villa, which was such a pleasant surprise. The villa itself has every amenity that you need, and then some. The temperature of the pool was perfect, complimentary bottled water and fruit every day, chocolates with turn down service, excellent housekeeping. Staff has been exceptional, even the owner was very friendly. Buggy rides to and from the villas were always fun. Shuttle service to Ubud town is complimentary, take advantage of it. Every meal at Cascades has been very good, a bit pricey though. Breakfast items are made to order and are very good. I highly recommend getting a Balinese massage in the spa. We rented bicycles to go around the resort and rice paddies, we enjoyed this throughly. The resort is perfect for couples and honeymooners because of its boutique quality and personalized service. The resort's location is not ideal for night life, shopping, or restaurants but theres always the shuttle to take you to Ubud town. But the views are what you're paying for, they are unparalleled. A trip to Bali has been a lifelong dream of ours and staying at the Viceroy has been the best decision we made."

","Exceptional Service - incredible ambiance, boutique environment","In and around Ubud there is no shortage of wonderful hotel properties. Much of what makes them great is the natural beauty and the engaging architectural features. Having stayed at many different and exceptional properties around the world, Viceroy Bali stands out because it has the feel of a private boutique retreat - as if designed for rock star getaways. Each villa feels like a private villa - your private villa - on a cobblestone street as if when going back to retire you are just walking to your own home. Naturally individual infinity pools overlooking the gorgeous ravine doesn't hurt! The chef Nic Vanderbeeken provides the in-house restaurant ""Cascades"" with amazing food - the presentation is crazy! Personally, I like simple food and preparation the most - so I was a fan of the breakfasts more than anything else although we did enjoy the tasting menu one evening. Having said that the breakfasts were so incredible, I think I could have had one again for dinner. Prices were very comparable to other resorts - but I think more reasonable than a few of the other restaurants that we were recommended to try around Ubud and candidly, Cascades is far and beyond the best quality.The general manager, the front desk associates Jero and the entire team were simply amazing. Accommodating. Wonderful. We wanted scooters for a couple of days. And there scooters are brand new, had ponchos in them in case there was rain and we were given lots of ideas about where to travel. By the third day we knew our way around everywhere. Just arrived home, parked our bikes and that was it. Cost for the bikes was 100,000 rupiah each which is about $8. I read somebody complaining that they were $5 somewhere else - but seriously…. waiting for you at the lobby brought around by the staff and absolutely perfectly maintained? This is living!The pool would have been nicer just a touch warmer in my opinion, but we had rain and that might have cooled it off. And the spa was amazing but I think the manager should try another resort just to get those finishing touches right. It was as if the spa was just shy of being what it was capable of - although I am splitting hairs here because it really was sensational. And lastly, the piano playing is great in the evening - but in general there should be some thought put to the piped in music playlist. This incredible hillside environment could benefit from a mix - from Buddha/lounge to Tony Bennett and so on. But I cannot listen to another Barbara Streisand some again. We seriously had to listen to ""Feelings"" on two evenings. I think this is just a tweak.In conclusion, it had a boutique feel, was well priced but had a level of personal concierge style service that made it feel like you were at your own private retreat with all the bells and whistles and benefits of a resort. Viceroy Bali I look forward to coming back."

","Top of the bill","This hotel was the best I ever stayed in (and I'm rather spoiled). Great location, great room (deluxe terrace villa) with a fine terrace with pool overlooking the rainforest and rice fields and a remarkable silent airco, nice restaurant runt by the Belgian chef Nick, friendly staff (especially our guide on a couple of tours: Nova), great spa treatments and the management makes you feel like family. They appreciated that we were long stay guests as most guests stay only for max 3 days. The managing director Margaret Bainbridge, her husband Otto and her son Anthony were great hosts. For example: when we made a remark to Anthony that the rain shower was not raining it was fixed the next morning. I asked Margaret which brands of cigarettes were sold in the kiosk. As mine wasn't they send a driver to the village to buy it. All in one: comforting pleasant!"

","""Stunninng, Traquil, Relaxing and Peaceful""","There are some places you stay that bring tears to your eyes when it is time to leave. The Viceroy in Ubud is one of those places. In our short two night stay we already felt like we had become part of the Viceroy family. We were swept away on arrival by the friendly staff with a beautiful lai of frangipani's and rose petals and a yummy ice tea. Immediately you know you have arrived somewhere very special. The view from the area around the infinity pool is simply breathtaking. This area of Ubud gives a feeling of quiet like no where else. The rooms here are so spacious and comfortable. My two boys were very excited to see their very own plunge pool and were quite taken away by the size of the shower! Sleeping a family of four can be testing at some hotels, usually they will only allow three in a room. But the reception staff here were more than accommodating. They provided a spare bed and the king size bed was roomy enough for my 9 year old son to squeeze in. (there is also a large comfy lounge) Although I could have stayed here for a length of time with my husband, two nights was plenty with two boisterous boys. Although they absolutely loved it, The Viceroy is more of a honey mooner's location. The Viceroy is the kind of place you want to share with all your loved ones. It is an experience."

","Absolutely Wonderful!!!","My partner and I stayed there six days and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay!! The rooms were very big, very private and romantic. We both had the best sleep at Viceroy! Loved the sheets so much that we even tried finding the exact kind in the shops in town, but no luckWhere does one start with the food. The food was out of this world! We loved getting up each morning to have our breakfast. We loved how it was not a buffet and how it was very fresh and that we could order as much as we wanted. My partner loved the bacon and said it was the best bacon he had ever had. I loved the rice pudding because it reminded me of my Nan’s rice pudding which she was very good at. Each dish at Viceroy I found took me to back to fond memories. Everything about the hotel was perfect but what made the hotel special for us was the staff. They were always very friendly and helpful! Everyone there was always smiling and polite. We had two drivers who took turns taking us to town and they were very very good drivers and people. (Nova) thank you so much for making our trip to Lovina very smooth. The hotel can arrange their cars to collect you from a place to their hotel or from their hotel to your next destination. We did that both ways and would definitely recommend it as you are collected in royalty style and welcomed the same way.Thank you everyone at Viceroy for making our trip to Bali so magical and unforgettable.

","Amazing Ubud retreat!","I had the fortunate pleasure of accompanying my daughther on a travel-writing trip to Bali that included a 3 night stay at the Viceroy, Ubud.The 5 star resort was luxurious to say the least. Our villa with private infinity pool lacked for nothing and overlooked the jungled valley, emphasizing the peace and tranquility of the surrounding area. The Cascades restaurant was a gourmet's heaven and the adjoining spa, complete with a 2 hour treatment left us feeling completely relaxed and wanting to stay there forever.The service from the staff was friendly, welcoming and first class.I look forward to returning here someday."

","Beautiful resort and amazing views from room","My husband and I stayed at the Viceroy for our honeymoon in November 2012. The grounds of the property were absolutely beautiful, everything was made of marble. The villa we stayed in was gorgeous and our balcony had the floating gazebo above the private pool. The views from the balcony was the jungle and it was stunning, you can hear birds and monkeys playing in the trees. Breakfast buffet was very good. Hotel was very quiet and we hardly saw the other guests. Price wise however, we felt it was a little overpriced, especially since we saw how far the US dollar can really go in bali. The center of the city was probably a 10 min cab ride from the hotel. I recommend renting a scooter in the city and checking out the sites in ubud!"

","Wonderful Honeymoon","We really enjoyed our honeymoon at the Viceroy Bali in Ubud. The staff were very welcoming, friendly and helpful throughout our stay, with good attention to detail. On arrival we were offered an upgrade to a larger apartment, which was such a lovely surprise. It was luxurious, with its own pool and pagoda, kind size bed and spacious living space (you are not overlooked at all). The hotel itself has fantastic views across the forest and a very attractive infinity pool. We enjoyed breakfast, lunch and dinner at the hotel and all food was up to a high standard. We did wish, however that there were more Balinese dishes on the dinner menu (although it was clear that the restaurant was predominantly French). We enjoyed a special night at the hotel which showcased Balinese dancers and a great menu, which was a highlight.Other highlights included a free shuttle service to and from Ubud (a great cultural town with lots of restaurants and craft shops), free bike hire so that we could explore rural Ubud from the hotel (got lots of great photos of the paddy fields, etc), petal bath on our last night and the cocktails (Lychee Martini was a favourite). We couldn't recommend this hotel enough to you if you are looking for a luxurious honeymoon with an exclusive feel."

","Overrated hotel, avoid at all cost.","where to start …My wife and I wasted 2 precious night at this overrated hotel. We arrived at the hotel after a night at Kayu Manis Private villas in Nusa Dua, where we enjoyed and pampered by Kayu Manis's hospitality.We arrived at the lobby of Viceroy Hotel with the hotel's shuttle, we proceed to the reception, BUT , the first words I received upon my check in was : ' How can i help you?' Well, we came with your hotel's shuttle to your hotel lobby and the lady receptionist asked me , how can i help you? Well, should i reply her that we came for a job interview ? or should I tell her to rephrase her welcome note to at least : ' Welcome to Viceroy, Mr …' Luckily the front desk manager, Mr Puca ( if i m not mistaken) was really helpful, in fact , he is the only well trained personal in this overrated 5 stars hotel. He greeted us and we checked into over villa with a little delay.THE SPA, We took a 2 hours spa treatment, one hour is complimentary from over room package. Base on their website description, this is a world class , out door spa where you could enjoy your treatment open air. Don't worry my friends, if you use the spa you will never enjoy that privilege at all. Indeed , the therapistS, only 2 of them, never even smile during the 2 hours treatment. I m from malaysia , I could understand what they are chatting during our treatment, basically , they are discussing how to charged us for the treatment. I mean, we spend so much money to enjoy our treatment , and what their need to do is concentrate on our treatment and we will pay whatever we should pay, thats is not need to discuss the payment during the treatment, We felt like they frighten that we will not pay them after the treatment.The treatment is indoor, even though the spa is empty, no other customer, no open air spa treatment. The hotel provides complimentary jacuzzi and sauna, which located within the spa, but you need to make an appointment to use the facilities if they is no other customer using the spa for treatment. To make it short, bad attitude of the staffs and bad treatment, the treatments are costly but you can find better spa in ubud town area which only costed usd 10. The restaurant, pricey but the food tasted like a fast food restaurant. But I have to say, I did complained the standard of the food to the restaurant manager, a gentlemen from France. He accepts my complain and did deducted the main course of my wife from the final bill, which is a reasonable touch as the food is really terrible. The service, is bad compared with other same standard restaurant. the staffs are not well trained besides a young man Mr Agong. In Kayu Manis private villas and spa Nusa Dua, all the staffs know your name, including the cleaner, wherever they meet them , they know your name .In viceroy, is completely opposite, 95% of they staff don't know your name, what they knows is smile at you. I mean you have less then 30 villas in your hotel. How hard to remember all your guests' name?We booked a private tour guide which costed us 160 usd for 8 hours, they price is higher that other hotel i asked e.g. Nusa Dua/ Hanging tree . However , we took the price is fine if we could get a professional tour guide to introduce us around Bali. On the morning of the tour, we found out that the tour guide is the driver of the hotel shuttle ! and with the hotel shuttle we will be having our tour. Ok , we can still accept that if the driver is professional enough, but the whole trip , what he did was driving the car ! We asked him to bring us to a shop where we could buy local foods as a present to our family. he brought us to a shop, we bought lots of local foods , but found when we reached home that the food are all expired or not in good condition. Bad bad arrangement by the hotel.Lots more bad experiences during our stay in viceroy. I wished we werent there. The two night we spent there is bad if not horrible.My opinion is that , they doesn't care about the service, everything there is about money money money. What they want is money, and money only. I don't think they care about review or return customers, their purpose is the to take whatever money they can from the guest.In Nusa dua the breakfast in our villa is FOC( room rates is 400 USD pernight). in Viceroy they charged USD 5 'delivery fee' to have your breakfast at villa ( room rates is 750 USD). I mean why USD 5 ? I wouldn't be so upset if u charged me 40 USD, but why 5 USD ? So why the service in Kayu Manis Nusa Dua is so much better then the service in Viceroy ?My conclusion is Kayu Manis is managed by a chain hotel corporation , where as the viceroy is a family run 'overrated', 'badly manage' , '5 stars' hotel. I wonder anyone in the family have any experience or qualification in hotel management. Maybe what they have is money , but without any common sense and management skills. They only purpose to run the hotel is to earn money and not about service , definitely doesn't care about the guests experience in their hotel.Unless you have plenty of cash to splash for nothing, try avoid this overrated hotel at all cost. they are plenty of hotel around, try Kayu Manis. Lastly, do not get attracted by the hill side views of this hotel, it is nothing special, just trees and thats it, it doesn't worth a trip ."

","You will not regret your stay! STAY AT THE VICEROY!","I will keep this short as most reviews mention how superb the Viceroy is :-). We have stayed at many 5 star boutique resorts in bali, this being the most recent. With out doubt the experience my partner and I had here simply second to none. What made the difference was the sheer fact that the staff were absolutely amazing. Everyone from reception to the buggy cart drivers, the gardeners to the shuttle service drivers were so friendly they just made you want to stay longer! So knowledgeable and willing to go the extra mile. Yes the resort was beautiful, the views awe inspiring, the rooms to die for, the food impeccable, grounds amazing but the people and staff really made an effort to make you feel ULTRA Special. This simply doesnt happen at the big resorts. The Viceroy is a small boutique resort with a small number of elegantly designed rooms designed for intimate settings and to escape. You certainly dont come to Viceroy if youre looking for thousands of people by the poolside, loud music and alcohol induced shenanigans! Before we go, a HUGE shout out and thanks to Gama a fantastic shuttle driver and Bali historian historian extraordinaire! A resort well worth the money."

","The reason you do NOT want to stay here...","........you will never want to leave! The Viceroy Bali is a top notch 5+ star Ubud paradise. The Viceroy Bali understands it is all in the details. No stone is left un-turned. Every need is anticipated, and you are left wanting nothing. Upon arrival (after a 30+ hour journey from the US), we were upgraded to the Regal II Villa from a Terrace Suite. The Villa is breathtaking, private, opulent, immaculate, peaceful, and welcoming. When we booked our excursions, while enjoyable, I couldn't wait to get back to the Viceroy. The staff genuinely cares. The Spa was amazing. Cascades restaurant was delicious. I decided that if I win the lottery or become independently uber wealthy, I will spend at least 3 months per year at the Viceroy Bali. I cannot say enough about this wonderful place. Everyone deserves this experience at least once in their life."

The hotel looked great, and after 5 night on the beach, jungle environment looked perfect. The deluxe villa we stayed in was huge, as was the pool in front of it. A little gazebo is a really nice touch, and the views from the pool and the gazebo towards the jungle were astonishing. Bathroom was very nice, with very interesting stone floor in the shower.Restaurant is located above the villas and also looks great, and the food was very tasteful. I loved the fresh pineaple juice for each of our 4 breakfasts, but the dinners were also perfect. Stuff was friendly and smiling all the time.Really enjoyed the stay."

","Best hotel we've ever stayed at!","My husband and I stayed at the Viceroy Bali for our honeymoon, and it was the best hotel experience we've ever had. The staff are extremely attentive, the villas are amazing, and the spa was also excellent. Staying here was extremely relaxing and just what we needed. We would love to go back there in the future, although making it all the way to Bali is probably not something that will happen too often for us."

","Recharging on the edge of a jungle stream","Service A+Amenities A+Location A+Staff A+The pictures on the resort website really miss all the fine details of the wonderful location. Polished marble floors and opulent decor inside our villa and throughout the grounds are only matched by the service we have experienced. Service that started in customs, to the hour drove to the property, to NEVER hearing the word no. Notable are the reception staff that have bent over backwards to make my honeymoon so very special. Notable is Stephan, the restaurant manager with wonderful knowledge of wine and food... Every meal bringing us a little something special. Walk up to reception and ask for a lift into town. In minutes we are carried away and dropped off in Ubud with dining recommendations, temples to see, streets to walk..all completely safe and filled with friendly helpful people. The Bali people are a kind and caring culture, really something to immerse yourself in. Back at the property we plunge into our huge infinity pool, lounge under a vaulted ceiling pavilion that covers a large seating area between two staterooms. We draw a bath and sit in silence as a wall of water trickles down in to a pool behind our bath. I did mention opulence???Customer service, location, amenities, and beautiful grounds make the Viceroy Bali a must visit destination."

","World class resort with impeccable service","We are staying at the viceroy bali for our honeymoon and are loving the people, the service and our villa! We had a minor bump in our stay and the manager handled our situation with the very best customer service possible. We could not be happier with the service, the amenities, the spa and our villa! Stephan, the restaurant manager has provided us with excellent service and food/ wine recommendations. The shuttle drivers are wonderful and made our experience amazing by recommending where to shop and eat. The resort is conveniently located near the town, but feels worlds away from civilization. Our spa service was outstanding and we will be revisiting the spa again before we leave. We cannot believe our view from our villa. We are staying in the Viceroy villa. The view is gorgeous, the pool is very large, and the bathroom is amazing! We have 100% privacy in all areas including the pool and Sala in our yard, and being that it is our honeymoon, this is very important to us. Overall, this is a world class resort with impeccable service, well kept grounds, and a perfect location for a romantic stay."

","Where do I start","This ies a true 5 star if not 6. We stayed in viceroy 4 nights on our honeymoon. I suggest staying in the deluxe terrace rooms worth the extra money. On arrival had a minor problem that was taken care of imediadately by the owner of the hotel Otto and parka one of the managers, both of whom are great people and very friendly. This hotel has it 100 percent right you feel like royality, from the comfort of the rooms, to the service, to the view, everything is simply wonderful and worth every penny. I would come back to Bali just to stay in ubud and the viceroy. I read other reviews that said the rooms are dirty etc, but I saw none of that maybe those are the older rooms. Two things I would say is one the spa is good but not out of this world special and two the food is good in the restaurant but they should have more easing going food on the menu, everything the have on the menu now is fine dining. Would I suggest this place ? Most definetly, but as I said go for the deluxe terrace, those are the newest rooms. Thanks again to Otto, parka, and the whole wonderful staff for such an amazing time...."

","Has potential to be a true 5-star Hotel","My wife and I recently traveled to Bali for 10 days and stayed at three resorts (Viceroy, Banyan Tree-Ungasan, and Club Intercontinental). The Viceroy was a very charming small resort with beautiful architecture. The room we stayed in was the deluxe terrace sweet. This room was very nice, however the daily room cleaning service failed to clean the shower during our entire stay. On the last day of our stay I went to go for a swim in the pool and luckily noticed that it was empty. I notified management and they worked on fixing it however it had not fully refilled prior to our departure. The restaurant is over rated and over priced compared to what you can find in Ubud. The breakfast that was included is limited and a little disappointing. I felt lucky that I had received and offer to stay 2 nights for the price on one (didn't feel like I got rob as bad). I have stayed in a number of SLH and this was the first time I have been disappointed. I will not stay here next time."

","excellent and food intolerence friendly","We had a very relaxing stay for 4 nights at the VIceroy. The staff were exceptionally helpful. Having recently found out that one of us needed to avoid gluten the restaurant manager and his staff were brilliant. Having let them know when we arrived i was furnished with gluten free slightly altered dishes at every meal. The food was excellent and the gluten free bread that they made was ok.Although the hotel is out of the way there is a free car service back and forth between town which makes it easy to pop out to the shops or get a meal if you don't want to alwyas eat in the hotel.Our villa was very clean and very spacious, we were slightly concerned after staying in a hotel before where each room had a private pool, but this one was very clean and pleasant.We really felt looked after by the staff."

","Good but not luxury","Having spent 10 days at the fabulous Oberoi in Seminyak, the next part of our stay was 3 days at the Viceroy in Ubud.Look if your looking for a very good hotel, in a beautiful area,with good service, large rooms and a heated plunge pool, then look no further, but do be aware that you can get the same for less than half of the US$625 per night you will pay here.There are no luxury touches that one would have expected. Even though we were upgraded from a garden to terrace villa on an Amex deal, its still 50% overpriced( compared to other Ubud properties)We stayed in Terrace villa 3The light fittings are by IKEA, and the light fitting in the alcove in the shower was loose ( see pic), the shower splashes here, so was concerned about electric safety.The balustrade around the pagoda ( short piece) was lose with a 50 ft drop onto concrete below.:- danger of deathThe wc room comes complete with a bacteria growing toilet brush, most quality hotels removed these in the 90's, after studies showed the dangers of these ( maybe for $625 I was expected to clean my toilet) also in the wc room, housekeeping never cleaned behind the door, dirt and cobwebs built up. Dust on top of mirrors..housekeeping very poor.The public wcs for the gents have a cubicle containing both wc and urinal, you cant use both at once, and when you use the wc it brings your nose down to the level of the acrid smells from the urinal;A poor offering of tea in the room, one expects loose tea and teas bags, this was no better than a 3 star hotel in a city centre. there is no kettle, just a coffee maker that dispenses lukewarm water.The skirting behind the desk and curtains was thick with dust see photo, not cleaned for weeksThe plunge pool was dirty at the bottom, lots of dirt in the cornersOutside furniture poorly maintained, in fact rotten, as brike when usedThe main pool area, there is nowhere to put your clothes except the floor..most hotels provide something even if its just a shelf under the table.Cascades restaurant, did however delight with its food, both for breakfast and evening meal, the restaurant manager always gave a warm welcome, and provided helpful local info. However they use a $3 door bell to call waiters when food is ready, which is really irritating ( a silent pager system is available for a few hundred $.The view is poluted by the bright lights in the restaurant, they would do well to turn them off and just use the candles on the tables. Breakfast was good food wise, but again cheap tea bags were served.All in all not worth the money, for cheaper we could have stayed at the 4 seasons!"

","Outstanding!","We only stayed for two nights but had a really memorable stay.My husband and I have stayed in fantastic hotels all over the world and in our opinion, the Viceroy is up there with the very best. This is a very friendly, beautiful, boutique style hotel with a lot of character.It was our wedding anniversary and the Viceroy went out of their way to help us enjoy our stay. We were upgraded from a Terrace to a Deluxe Terrace room which was very beautiful - huge bed, fantastic bathroom and so clean and fresh. All the staff were very friendly and efficient.The concierge arranged for us to visit a local market in Gianyar which was exactly what we were looking for with NO other tourists.While we were staying here, we popped over to the Four Seasons, Sayan, (where I nearly booked) for cocktails but it was absolutely not in the same league as the Viceroy. I'm so pleased I made the right choice.We particularly liked the restaurant, Cascades, where we had a lovely meal. We started with great cocktails by the pool with delicious canapes and looked over the dinner menus while relaxing with our drinks. Then we ate at the very beautiful restaurant. I am French and I know my food and believe me, the food here is certainly the best I have had in Bali. The attention to detail is exceptional. They even made a surprise anniversary chocolate dessert which was a lovely touch.I have just read a review dated 22 September by a lady from Abu Dhabi. Hmmmm. I cannot believe we are talking about the same hotel!! One questions their standards .......Thank you to Stephane, the restaurant Manager for making our stay so very pleasant and also for the list of recommendations in Seminyak! Very helpful .....Breakfasts were fabulous too with stunning views! You really could just eat anything or everything you liked on the menu. Just amazing!We highly recommend the Viceroy which was the highlight of our trip, along with the Alila in Uluwatu!"

","Doesn't worth the money spent. Avoid it!","Me and my husband staid 4 nights in a TERRACE VILLA.The hotel pretend to be very exclusive.. few villas, an heliport.. but nothing is working as a luxury and exclusive place and here why:- the private pool is so cold that you can't use it!!!- the concierge suggest us to go so early (5.45 am) at the rice paddies that it was so dark that we couldn't even take some pictures!- the TERRIBLE restaurant manager was keeping asking to try the restaurant in the hotel! My god.. he was miserable and desperate. Why not to tempt guest to come to the restaurant with other techniques? The restaurant has horrible reviews... of course people don't go. And it was sad... no more than 3 pax for dinner.. - One morning we left the hotel very early so we asked to packed something specific for breakfast since my husband has several allergies. The carton box of the breakfast was presented in an horrible black plastic bags (like the garbage bags!!!), and it was wrong.. they didn't make what we asked for.! so my husband didn't have his breakfast.- The service is just ok... we made few questions.. because we felt that something was not very clear.. how is it possible that in an hotel with such a big name and reputation things are going that way.. They told us that the hotel is run by a family. The hotel manager is the son of the owner but he's never there.. and they've been training for another local guy...- We've been upgraded to the terrace villa because as they said the villa we reserved was old and they want to offer us a better stay. Of course we were happy and surprised. When we entered in the room I asked what was the name of the room we reserved because i didn't remember.. He told me : it was a garden villa, if you don't like this one you can go back in that one! ?????? I was like: whaaaat??? Is this the way to answer!??! No words.If you are used to stay in luxury hotels, it doens't worth the money. Maybe it can be good for the honeymooners that will see a luxury hotel once in their life. That's it. Avoid it!!"

","A little slice of paradise ....","We had a blissful week in The Viceroy. The staff are exceptionally helpful and can't do enough to help you. They have a car service that will take you to Ubud town centre during the day and the evening and will collect you when you are finished, they are really reliable and the service is invalauable. The restaurant is amazing but rather expensive, perfect for a special occasion. You can take a trip into Ubud and get an amazing meal for approximately £3!The spa is beautiful and a calm and tranquil place to relax.The hotel over looks what can be only described as a Jurassic valley where you can see monkeys' from your terrace and imagine you are in the middle of nowhere. We had a Terrace Villa which had its' own pool and overlooked the valley. It was super quiet and we had a fabulous week. I can only praise the staff again, they were SO helpful and pleasant, I would certainly return again."

","Amazing resort; far from beach","I was booked in the viceroy villa (Presidential Suite) for 4 days here. Probably one of the better hotel stays. The Viceroy I believe is family owned which gives it a much more personal feel.Check in was simple; I was showed to my room. The villa had 2 bedrooms, a large living room and a full sized pool. Bedding was good, finishes were ok. The restaurant in the hotel was probably the best restaurant in Bali. I had breakfast there 3 days and it was delicious; ended up ordering dinner there twice also (also delicious). I stayed at the Bulgari hotel after the Viceroy and the restaurant at the Viceroy was far better than the Bulgari hotel.Service was pretty good; they do what they can to accommodate you. I was single at the time of traveling and was attending a friend's wedding. The only complaint I have was that everytime the staff entered my room, they looked at me ridiculously and asked me ""you are staying here by yourself"" and snickered behind my back (its typically a couples resort). Perhaps the most important thing to know about this hotel is that it is far away from the beach. If you don't plan on going to the beach or if you plan on staying in two different hotels, then its not a big deal. WIth the traffic in Bali, if you want to go to the beach I do not recommend staying at this hotel unless you plan on taking the helicopter exclusively. My friend took a 4 hour taxi ride to visit me at my hotel, roughly 20kms maximum. All in all, good stay, worked out for me because I stayed 4 days here and 3 days over at the Bulgari so I got to experience both sides of Bali."

","Amazing! Heaven on Earth, I don’t want to leave this place","I visited Viceroy Bali for 2 days and 1 night last week of August, and my experience of stay is so “AMAZING and UNFORGETTABLE”. This 5-star hotel is in the heart of Ubud, where the place is so tranquil, peaceful and beautiful. Viceroy Bali has a grand entrance; Helipad is the first thing that you will see once entering their hotel. The staffs are so warm and welcoming. They gave me garland, welcome drinks and cool towel on my arrival.I stayed on the “Deluxe Terrace Villa” and the room is so beautiful and fabulous, have super size king bed, huge bath tub, hot & cold shower, day bed, 42” inch LCD TV, iPod/iPhone docking station, and “inside pool” which has the most spectacular view of the forest and river.The breakfast is amazing! A-la cart style (buffet) meaning, whatever your choices in the menu you can order and they will amazingly cook for you. On my second day, I went to their SPA (Lehmba Spa), had 1 hour massage, body scrub, floral bathe, Jacuzzi and steam sauna, that gave me 2 hours of full relaxation (mind & body). And, at night, I had a seven-course meal romantic candle light dinner which has the best selection of food (credit to the F&B Manager for choosing finest menu).I left BALI that my heart is in “Viceroy”. Been to many places and stayed to many hotels but my stay in Viceroy is the best so far... And, I am so recommending this for “couple” who wants to have a romantic vacation or honeymooners. This place is such a paradise that convinced me not to go somewhere else in Bali but to stay only on their hotel. Wonderful staff, amazing room and tranquil place.Viceroy is the best place to stay in BALI!!!"

","Ubud Bali experience of a lifetime","Staying in ubud is a must do for a Bali vacation. The viceroy was beautiful. We had villa #1 and it was so relaxing and peaceful. Our driver Muggy was so helpful and knowledgable and friendly. He took us to the elephant sanctuary and the rice terraces and the water palace temple and for a tour of a traditional Bali family compound.

I have done a lot of travelling and visited many places around the world, but this hotel by far has to be one of the most magical places I have had the privilege of staying in. The privacy, tranquility and over all experience is truly perfect if you are in need of relaxation and pampering. Each and every detail of this amazing hotel is a credit in so many ways. The hotel has everything you could need, and your stay can be tailored to suit any wish or requirement. The restaurant offers exquisite cuisine, the spa offers beautiful treatments my massage was unbelievable. I organised a guided trekking tour, as well has having high speed wireless Internet through out the property, access to a gym, my own private pool and oasis, and complimentary shuttle service to and from Ubud. The hotel is safe, secure, and pure luxury a must see for anyone traveling to Bali or wanting to experience a holiday you will never forget."

","Simply Paradise!","The fact that. I am writing this review from my sun bed on my private terrace at the Viceroy, on the sixth day of a seven day stay at the Viceroy, speaks volumes because I'm normally rather lazy about making contributions to Trip Advisor. However, this hotel is so fantastic that I have to share my experience with others. The problem I have is that this place is so great, I don't know where to begin!Firstly the accommodation is absolutely fantastic - as good, if not better than the photographs. We are currently staying in a Deluxe Terrace Villa and it is outstanding - the best Hotel room I have stayed in, by far. Our private infinity pool and terrace area is simply stunning and we have loved using it every day. Several contributors have commented that the pool was too cold to use, but I have enjoyed swimming in ours every day - the trick is to switch off the fountain for a while before entering the water as this allows the sun to warm the water more efficiently. Any potential visitors to the Viceroy should be reassured to learn that this hotel has excellent systems in place to ward off unwanted insects and bugs - we haven't been bitten by any mosquitoes, which is quite remarkable!The staff at this place are some of the best I have ever encountered; They are so warm and friendly and cannot do enough for you. In addition, it is refreshing to find that the owners are regularly on hand to meet and greet guests and they are genuinely interested in receiving comments and feedback from visitors.The food at the Cascades Restaurant is first class and the wonderful breakfast menu will meet the highest expectations. In addition, we have enjoyed the ambience of the restaurant in the evenings and the excellent quality of the food and wine. The prices seem to us to be quite reasonable and certainly what we would expect to pay in a hotel of this calibre. Stephane, the restaurant manager, needs a special mention, as he provides a very attentive, yet discrete, service to all his guests. The Lembah Spa is also great with friendly, attentive staff. We have enjoyed our treatments and have more planned prior to leaving this place.Another good service is the free shuttle to Ubud and the availability of drivers and cars for private tours. We enjoyed a great afternoon tour with Catur (Number 4) as our knowledgeable, friendly driver and guide.Thanks, once again, to everyone at the Viceroy. You have made sure that we have enjoyed a wonderful, relaxing break at your remarkable resort. We intend to return to the paradise that is the Viceroy, when we are en route to Australia and New Zealand next year."

I can't speak highly enough of the place; it is haven like and the atmosphere of the hotel is relaxing beyond measure.The staff genuinely seem to care that the guests enjoy every minute. The staff at the Cascades restaurant in particular; they were so impressive. I have never encountered anything like it and I have travelled ALOT. They are just so eager to please WITHOUT being intrusive at all. You really enjoy the meals there. The food is excellent, really delicious and wonderful. The manager, Stefan, is incredibly knowledgeable and is always on hand to make wine recommendations etc., Breakfast was a DELIGHT every morning.The rooms are beautifully appointed. We visited the spa twice and it was truly excellent. I am a massage connoisseur and I was very impressed. I plan to return for sure. It was a wonderful experience. This hotel really is unique.

Beautifully decorated and spacious, clean, with ample space for luggage and clothes. Nice small swimming pool with just the right temperature for a refreshing dive!The only restaurant in the resort - CasCades - was beautiful and with very nice food, excellent manager - thank you Stefan! - but with slow service which most of the times we did not mind as the staff are SOOOO friendly and attentive. Drinks are RIDICULOUSLY expensive!!Keep in mind that all meals are a la carte, so if you are a fan of buffets this resort is not for you. There is plenty of choice though, the cuisine is French/Indonesian and excellent.The owners are there most of the times to greet you and see that you are pleased with your stay.There is a small boutique with a good variety of local things to buy for you, your friends and your relatives if you so wishThe weather was a bit of a let down - August is supposed to be dry and sunny - but who can you blame for this!?All in all we had a great time and we would gladly go back.Whilst we were there we visited the monkey forest, the local market, the elephant safari park, the rice paddies and the coffee and teas plantation. They are all worth a visit but the elephant safari park was the best for us (our first time in such a place)"

","Lovely Honeymoon","We stayed here for our second part of our honeymoon. This has to be one of the most amazing hotels we have stayed in ever! We were given the terrace villa 1, which had amazing pretty much 360 views through glass windows, however after 1 night we had asked to move as the room was not bug proof at all! Geckos were coming in through small gaps and making noises all night and we woke up to bugs on our sheets from them falling from the roof! We then got moved to one of their Deluxe Villas, which was perfect and had no problems for the rest of the stay.The staff were very friendly and attentive, could not fault this in any way. The hotel's free shuttle service was brilliant as we could get into Ubud centre quickly without struggling with public transport. Few negative pointers: There was building work going on outside our villa, which we were aware of but they did start this at 6am in the morning which we thought was a bit early. The drinks in the bar/restaurant are very over priced and cocktails were not good at all. Finally the pools in the villas really should be heated as they were very cold and we hardly used it.But overall a beautiful place :)"

","Amazing!!","We spend our Honeymoon at Viceroy and was not disappointed. What a beautiful and amazing place. We loved every bit of it. We had booked a Deluxe Terrace Villa which was really big and with out own pool (a bit cold though) The bathroom was beautiful and the terrace was very private and had a beautiful view over the valley. Very friendly and helpful staff. Top service!! Very romantic place!!The food from Cascade Restaurant was more than amazing. We were surprised every time from the breakfast menu, to the local Indonesian lunch to the 6 course menu. Wonderful!! On out last night we had our ""private"" dinner with flowers around the table and curtains closed around us. Indeed a very romantic night.However, that massage my husband received was not very good, and they didn't ask us if we wanted a male or female masseuse. Besides that the spa is also beautiful located, and once done with your massage you can go out to the Jacuzzi and enjoy the view over the valley.Thanks again for a wonderful stay in Ubud."

The staff was excellent and they made our stay even more special than it would have been, going out of their way to do the little “extras”. The location is beautiful, with great views.

","Stylish boutique hotel in Bali's cultural heartland-","Everything about the Viceroy is stylish! It is built on a ridge overlooking a river valley covered with rainforest, with glimpses of rice fields in the distance. There are many superlatives for this resort: friendly, attentive service; very good food; a genuine interest in the guests from management and staff.The first impression is of the layout of the buildings on the site – the architecture and the decoration of the public spaces and the rooms are of a much higher standard than typically encountered throughout Asia.The room we had was spacious, beautifully appointed and with its own private infinity-style swimming pool overlooking the river valley.Cascades restaurant was excellent, with a wide range of European and Indonesian dishes.The Viceroy is a smallish hotel with about 25 villas. Consequently, the staff seem to know every guest by name. All very helpful in recommending things to see in Ubud and the surrounding district.The Viceroy is expensive but we felt they delivered the value that we expected."

","Relax in luxury","Nothing short of spectacular - the beautiful grounds, the unbelievable views and the impeccable service make the Viceroy incomparable. My husband and I spent 4 days of our honeymoon here and it was heaven. Even at full occupancy, the experience is relaxing, quiet and romantic. The only minor let-down was that on check-in we were promised 'something special' in our room the following day (as they were aware we were celebrating our honeymoon), but that appeared to have been forgotten. It's neither here nor there for us to have anything special done, but it's hard to ignore after it was promised and unfulfilled.Breakfast at the hotel restaurant CasCades was included in our rate...and in a word: Wow! We also had dinner at CasCades on 2 nights as well and I have to say, they were by far the best meals we had in Bali. CasCades offers mainly French cuisine, with a few popular Indonesian options. My only recommendation here is that they perhaps vamp up the local menu. When in Rome....Service was unobtrusive but totally attentive. My husband was fighting off a throat and chest infection since we left Canada, and finally succumbed to getting on antibiotics. The hotel arranged for their on call doctor to arrive within 30 minutes (at around 8pm) - fast, efficient, and relatively inexpensive.We also had the wonderful opportunity of meeting one of our favourite staff members at the Viceroy, Made Gama. Gama picked us up from our hotel in Seminyak, and we were struck with his kindness and respectful openness. We requested that he take us on a couple of customized tours and they were the highlight of our trip. He humbly shared so much about his homeland - and showed us several awe-inspiring spots that make Bali so unique. Thank you Gama; we're fortunate to have met you.And thank you to all the Viceroy staff - we hope to see you all soon!"

","Absolutely Amazing!","From the moment we were picked up from the airport we were treated like family! The level of professionalism paired with excellent personalization made our experience in Bali a dream come true. The fact that you have the option to have your personal driver to escort you around the island offered a sense of security you will need to explore the ends and out that Bali has to offer! When you book your stay ask for Katut the Driver...he is the best!"

","Outstanding","We visited the Viceroy in June for 4 nights during our Honeymoon. It was an outstanding property and they provided many little touches to make our stay feel great: candle-lit dinner for two, rose petal path, and a complimentary couples massage were all included.Room: We stayed in a deluxe terrace villa. The villa was very spacious and the private infinity pool overlooking the gorge was absolutely stunning. Our favorite feature though was probably the shower – definitely the biggest rain shower head we have ever had (would love one like that in our house some day!) Service: 5-star service the whole way. Food service, turndown service, cleaning service, spa service – all of it was outstanding. But what we really appreciated was the guidance and advice of the staff when it came to booking activities. There is a TON to do in Ubud, and the staff at the front-desk was super helpful every night talking to us about potential things to do. And importantly, they were also always available with a buggy whenever our legs were too tired to make the walk back to the villa.Food: Far and away the best resort food we had all week. Cascades was outstanding. We ate there every morning (breakfast is included) and also tried the high tea in the afternoon and dinner on a couple of occasions. Stephane the food & beverage manager is always nearby waiting with recommendations, and his advice was always appreciated! On our last night the wait staff set-up a private table for us near the pool deck and even put together a personalized menu for us. It was a nice touch and really made us feel special on our honeymoon. Even if you don’t stay at the Viceroy, we would definitely recommend stopping at Cascades for a meal.Overall, Viceroy was an excellent choice for the honeymoon. The setting overlooking the gorge is outstanding, and the staff is top-notch. Really no complaints on the resort or the service.Looking back on our trip, however, Ubud was the one part of Bali where we spent very little time in the actual resort. There was so much to see and do that we did not really spend time just lounging at the pool or taking advantage of other resort amenities. With that in mind, it may make sense while in Ubud to scale back on the accommodations and put that money toward resort upgrades on other parts of the island where you’ll actually spend time at the resort."

","Amazing place!","I've stayed at the Viceroy twice and was even married on the grounds. It's the best place on the island.. It's such a private, relaxing and luxurious hotel..I understand that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but for those who have given the viceroy anything less that a 5 star rating... well they are just wrong. The whole hotel experience is flawless."

","Excellent hotel with excellent staff","Firstly, I'd like to start with the staff. This is a wonderful hotel in its design, luxuriousness and many other aspects but it wouldn't be half the hotel it is if it weren't for their staff and I hope the owners know, respect and reward this. It is exceptionally rare that having nice staff goes beyond a small bonus but the service and friendliness from the Viceroy staff is second to none. In particular, Catur (or ""Chess""), one of the drivers deserves special recognition. Always going above and beyond and one of life's good guys - he made our holiday at the Viceroy. Also very special was Agung, our waiter at Cascades restaurant. Friendly, funny, generous, knowledgeable....Anyway, onto the hotel.... It is wonderful. We stayed in a 1 bed pool villa (room 15). We arrived by helicopter (a must if you've got the cash!) and were led to reception where the staff gave us the option of a room immediately (we were a good 4 hours before official check in) or waiting for a better room which should be ready in an hour. A very nice touch to have the choice. Anthony, the owners son also came and made a personal welcome and suggestion. The rooms are beyond luxurious. Huge, exceptionally well appointed, amazing views - they really have it all. You're in your own perfect little world for the stay. The food in-room is delicious and fairly reasonably priced. Location wise it is only 10 minutes into Ubud - a fascinating town with loads to do. The other nicety is a free shuttle, whenever you want it. Simply call guest services 10 minutes before you want to go and hey presto....We did white water rafting (good fun if a little simple and a conveyor belt of tourists), monkey forest (interesting for an hour or so but beware of the little bu**ers if you have food on you) and a bike ride (hot but totally worth it) up to the coffee plantation (you can buy ""cat-poo-ccino"" beans for only £50 per 150g - normally 3-4 times this in the UK). The only slight disappointment was the Spa. Is hard to put your finger on why but there seemed a totally different vibe here from the staff. They seemed bored and the massages were very second rate. Nothing too major, just disappointing for us compared to the rest of the hotel.All in all we would highly recommend this hotel and we will definitely be back again!"

","3 nights in heaven","We stayed here as part of our honeymoon back in March 2011. We were here for three nights and it was our first time to Bali. From start to finish this was pure luxury; the food, the location, the villas, the pools-just amazing...We had a great value honeymoon package with a pampering couples massage and degustation. The food here is probably in our top three restaurants of all-time, worldwide. Even a simple snack like a club sandwich was elevated to the extent that we still salivate thinking of it over two years later!If you are after romance, great service, privacy and total bliss-come here. The experience of sitting on your bale next to your private plunge pool, overlooking the forest and valley is unbeatable and utterly relaxing. The bathrooms are also out of this world and we wish we could find a bath like the ones here!Thank you Viceroy for making our honeymoon beautiful."

They just always say yes. Regardless of what you want they just make it happen. The staff are so genuinely friendly and happy to have you. That is a beautiful thing about the Balinese people.

","Behold The Viceroy, Bali - Just a special touch of paradise","When it comes to a stunningly immaculate resort, coupled with breathtaking views, superior staff hospitality, and food that will leave you wanting more (even after you’re full) — The Viceroy (Ubud, Bali) ticks all the boxes — and beyond. In April 2013, my wife and I spent our honeymoon in The Viceroy for four nights. After leaving, let’s just say we would have loved to have extended our stay for 40 nights (if only). Resort – 10/10Nestled in the lush forest mountains of Ubud this resort offers some of the most picture-perfect views a resort has to offer. The deluxe terrace villa (with a private infinity pool) is immensely luxurious and spacious. The highlight of the villa is the private infinity pool which overlooks the beautiful green valley. If you’re not one to sleep-in during a holiday, make an exception because watching the sunrise on the mountain horizon will definitely leave you feeling entranced and in awe. It’s worth getting up early to see this spectacular occurrence. In the glorious dawn upon waking up, the sun rays luminously pierce through hazy fog and in to the lush palm trees.In the evenings, the villas are very quiet so expect nothing less than a good night’s sleep. In fact it’s so quiet, you could hear a gecko crawling (not that that there were any in the room).If getting around will be a major part of your stay, then the Viceroy conveniently offers a shuttle bus every fifteen minutes where a driver will take you downtown (or a desired destination around Ubud). Service and people – 10/10Friendliest people — ever! The hotel staff at Viceroy are extremely warm and kind-hearted. One thing that strikes you is the sincere welcoming feeling that staff provide you to such a degree, that it almost feels like they would move heaven and earth just to make sure that your needs are fulfilled. More so they certainly make you feel more though you are a family member rather than a travelling guest.Another plus is that almost everybody speaks English (fluently), from the hotel staff to the local villagers of Ubud, which was certainly refreshing. The simplicity of having to deal with locals who can speak English – something many, many South East Asian resorts have lacked – was most certainly delightful to deal with.When it comes to staff hospitality at Viceroy, the staff here are the definition of customer service.Food (Cascades restaurant) – 10/10Perfection. Elegant. Satisfying. Delicious. Delightful. Beautifully presented. These are just some of the words I could muster to describe the to-die-for food at the Viceroy’s award winning restaurant – The Cascades. The food at this restaurant is something to behold. The menu is divided in to two sections — lunch and dinner – both offering a mouth-watering selection of inviting entrée, main courses, and dessert. As a seafood buff, the highlights of this menu for me included lobster bisque and lobster mornay just to name a couple (see photos).The Cascades also offers a generous range of cocktails and drinks that are indeed second to none. The highlight was the Smiling Margaret cocktail (named after the wonderful owner), and the reasonably priced 50-year-old Remy Martin Congac XO.To get the most of the Cascades experience, a cocktail by the bar overlooking the sun setting upon the mountains with a Jazz pianist on the grand piano is definitely a must-do at this resort.To Margaret, who made our stay here that extra bit special – thank you so much from the bottom of our hearts."

","Simply Outstanding - Possibly Addictive","I arrived 2 days ahead of my wife and was immediately struck by the relaxed atmosphere. Within 12 hours of her arrival she also commented unprompted that the Viceroy was intoxifying n its relaxation and it was hard to think beyond just relaxing all day. Our free 2 hour session at Lembah Spa was wondrous, an eye opener even for my wife who knows her spas! The staff could not be more helpful or friendly, they are close to hand but not intrusive, extraordinarily polite and helpful. This was apparent even before my arrival in the efficient manner they took my reservation and answered all my questions. The rooms lack nothing and as a frequent business traveller it is rare to be able to say that. All the electrical outlets you could need, where they should be. Comprehensive information for guests. Superb shower and bath. Pool setup just right. Restaurant, truly fine dining, maybe a change in menu occasionally as after a week n seems monotonous and combined with seemingly v high prices for food and drink, will encourage guests to eat out more - but I did enjoy every mouthful and sip! It's not a cheap holiday, but worth it. Only other place that made me feel this good was Montra in Koh Samui. If management could persuade the farmer on the opposite side of the valley to remove the unsightly tin sheeting and other contraptions, the view would be even better."

","fantastic although obviously quite spendy","i traveled to bali with a friend and we split the responsibility of finding hotels. he booked us 2 nights at the viceroy. apparently there was some online deal but even so, it was $500US per night. i nearly passed out when i discovered the cost.having said that, it was lovely. our room was huge with a small private pool and a deck overlooking a valley and rice paddies. we loved the room -- absolutely no problems with it. the staff at the hotel were delightful, and they drove us into town on a couple of occasions. they are pretty strict about dropping people off at one of two places -- yes, i understand that ubud is becoming a huge sprawling town but honestly it would be nice if they would extend this service to more of ubud. (we were there during the low season, not many hotel guests, and hotel cars seemingly always available).the breakfast was awesome. you order a la carte but there did not appear to be a limit on how things you could order and everything was delicious. definitely some of the best food i ate in ubud.so, stay here if you want a great memorable hotel and don't mind spending a small fortune. there are equally incredible but less costly options in ubud, though."

","Simply Paradise","I had spent several days in Kuta and Seminyak and the hustle-and-bustle and tacky tourism that has overrun some of these locales wore me out. So upon arriving at this jewel of a hotel, I finally was able to relax and experience the rejuvenating powers of this magical island in a peaceful, serene setting. There is one thing that stands in my mind, more so than anything else, in describing the Viceroy and that is serenity. The lush settings, the warm and intimate staff, and the presence of other like-minded guests really add up to give one a sense of being in a time and space that transcends the sterility that sometimes permeates the usual five-star chain hotels. I didn't feel this way staying at the Viceroy. I felt as though I was being treated like a dear family member who had returned after being away for a while, not the usual forced smiles and corporate, servile attitudes I'd encounter elsewhere. I highly recommend this wonderful establishment if you are the type of discriminating guest who seeks the intimate and warm, over the over-hyped corporate brands."

","Wonderful","After staying 4 nights in Samaya Seminyak, we were thinking to go to Samaya Ubud. Then in Small Luxury Hotel's web site I saw Viceroy and after checking comments in tripadvisor, we decided 4 nights in Viceroy and it was a very good decision. If I write here, like some others, "" this is the best hotel in Ubud "", it will not be fair because I did not see the others. But it is not also fair this hotel is in 29th place in Ubud tripadvisor.! It has to be surely in first 3.When you check in, you are welcomed with Balinese hospitality and till you leave you feel it. In every small corner in the villa or in the hotel you can also smell Balinese culture. Wood carving products, statues, all let you feel that you are in Bali. Also Perfect balance between privacy and nature.Deluxe Terrace Villa's are simply wonderful. Very nice decorated, big enough and pool with a nice bale in front of jungle view is amazing. This is surely a hotel over 5 star standards.Cascade restaurant is also very nice but menu is limited. It is hard to eat there everyday because of limited choices in menu. Of course it is also normal for a hotel with 21 villa only.When I come to Bali again, no doubt I will stay another 4-5 days in Viceroy."

When searching for a quiet place to finish on a PhD, I found the Viceroy. The small 5* boutique Hotel is perched at the cliff of a ravine in the ravishing jungle forest just 10 min of Ubud. My terrace villa left nothing to my dreams, an own infinity pool, had it, a small gazebo hut on top of the pool for my academic needs, had it, a fridge filled of a choice selection (free of charge), had it, a shower & bath area of half room size (20m2) - had it, a huge bed super king size - had it! Not to speak of the marvellous Spa (checked in twice!) and the outstanding restaurant and bar called CasCades. A true dream in the green! I can recommend it to any honeymooners wishing to escape the huzzle and buzzle of Bali and enjoy the secluded-ness of an island in the jungle. So to say like Tarzan & Jane.... Just 5*"

Not recommended for kids as they don't have much facilities apart from the spa and area for yoga. What I like about the resort is that the staff is very friendly, top class service. The free shuttle to and fro Ubud town is a plus. The food served at Cascades is superbly amazing with generous portion and ingredients for western meals, but not so for local meals. If you want authentic local meals at less than half the price, you can have them in Ubud town. Would definitely come again !!"

Not because we where unhappy but just to experience something new - but at the same level. Well, after surfing for hours we decided we will stay at Viceroy again...

","One of the best in Ubud!","Having stayed at several hotels in Ubud and other parts of Bali, this is truly one of the best hotels I've ever experienced. The villas are fantastic and impeccably maintained, with every detail paid attention to. Each has a private pool and all the amenities you'd expect from a 5 star property. The food is amazing and all meals are served a la carte. If you prefer to use the main pool rather than spending the day in your villa, you will always find a spot there, too, even when the hotel is full. You can rent bikes as well as scooters to explore Ubud, or the hotel will provide transportation to and from the town center complimentary throughout the day. The entire resort is beautifully maintained and you feel like you're in a brand new hotel but with servcie levels you'd expect from an experienced, seasoned team of professionals. Definitely something I will recommend to family and friends!"

","Impeccable place - but has Ubud lost it?","I am a seasoned traveller - please read my profile to put my review into perspective. I lived in SE-Asia for 6 years in the early 2000's and still come back lots. I stayed at the Viceroy with my wife for 6 days just before new year. For people less familiar with Bali, it is a high end Ubud boutique hotel; there are about 4-6 similar ones around Ubud, such as the Alila or the Hanging Gardens. Hotels around Ubud provide the rice terrace / mountain type holiday feel, whereas Kuta, Seminyak and most other well known suburbs in Bali typically are the more ""Beach type"" places. Make sure the mountains / rice fields is what you are after if you go to the Viceroy (or any hotel around Ubud)If this is what you like, then the Viceroy does a fantastic job, at a high end price. The rooms are very luxurious even for this top end type of hotel, probably the most luxurious I have ever seen in the tropcis. This makes unfortunatley for a somewhat less ""Bali style"" environment (which would be more rustic) however the rooms make up for it with pictures and art pieces as well as the design of the exteriors and the overall 'village' style feel of the property which is very ""Bali"". We had a lux terrace villa, I think that is the medium room category, with plunge pool. (BTW I think the plunge pool and innter courtyard are a ""must"", we would have been disappointed had we only had the communal pool available, see below). The room was very large, had also a very large bathroom, big bathtub and oversized shower, and everything worked perfectly. Best part of the villa was the very private plunge pool and the little private pagoda built half over it, half hanging high over the edge to the valley; it was our favorite place of the trip. Overall, the room quality is really what makes the Viceroy stand out compared with the other abovementioned places, it is phenomenal. All (~22?) rooms are build into the slope of one side of a valley which contains a little river (that can be heard but not seen) and you pretty much look into the other side of the valley with a very nice view of palmtrees, rice fields and lush greens into every direction. While the view directly ahead is a bit limited as you are below the crest of the valley, you can see the Bali vulcanoes one you look to your left, through the valley, which makes a fabulous view particularly after rain, when mist comes up all around. Fantastic view. Service around the room was just perfect and very friendly.As to facilities, the restaurant was nicely built, had great service and good food, and is apparently one of the best fine dining restaurants in Ubud. However, we felt a little lonely at times, and menu choice was also limited, both for dinner and breakfast, particularly after 6 days. Wine, as in so many places (but not all) in Bali, is ridiculously overpriced, some bottles up to 5x their retail price. Still, a top notch restaurant, and the bar to the side was very nicely designed to make the most out of the proximity of the restaurant and pool and the view over the valley. The Spa was nice although a little 'clinical' in appearance. However, I had absolutely the best treatment and massage I ever had, including many in Europe, all Asia and Australia. Outstanding and professional. Very impressive, and at a fairly reasonable price. The gym was very good, with all basic equipment and free weights provided, and less outdated than you typically find in boutique hotels. The treadmill was not working though. The communal pool was very nice with that same great valley view from a bit higher up, although the space to 'hang out' there is a little limited. The Alila or the hanging gardens are probably better if 'see and be seen' at the main pool is what you are after; however, for us it was not a big deal as we were mostly lying by our own plunge pool in our private courtyard anyways. Overall therefore, the hotel was absolutely outstanding - if the small, boutique and sometimes somewhat overly quiet feel is what you are after.However, what did put us off was Ubud in itself. While one might argue that that should not be part of the hotel discussion, I believe it has to be, as the hotel is very small and most people will want to venture into the city at least for dinner, but probably also for shopping and a bit of local experience. This was the problem for us.I have been to Ubud for the first time 12 years ago, and already then it was fairly ugly experience to walk through the city; since then, it just got a lot worse. The crazy traffic, constant contruction sites, incredible pollution, dangerous footpaths (if any), dirt and ruins everywhere this time got to me after just a day. It has been there for the past 10 years plus, but has multiplied to an extend where I just didnt want to go into Ubud anymore, other than for dinner after suset when the traffic had quieted and the dirt wasn't so obvious. Still lots of nice restaurants around, however I could not get over the feeling that Ubud was in the process of 'being left behind' as all shops have opened franchises in Seminyak, Ubud is growing but not in quality but quantity, and infrastructure remains as bad as ever, but with 4 times the traffic. Seriously, I dont understand why people still go there, it has lost all of its original 'alternative / nature / romantic / hippie' charms it was once famous for, and all the new developments in Bali are elsewhere on the island. If you want to stay in your resort all day, you can still have the rural rustic flair; other than for that, I will not return. All this is a little unfair to the Viceroy, as they have done the very best and created a luxurious paradise within their boundaries, however location and surroundings are important and my tip is to think this one through very carefully; the very negative Ubud experience has definitely spoiled some of my holiday mood this time around. A couple of tips on the side: do your shopping in Seminyak, not Ubud - much more choice of the same kind; ""mosaic"" is a really good fine dining alternative, and ""bridges"" still has the old ubud flair, style, quality and food at better prices - at least by night. If you like the review, please vote 'helpful' or leave a brief compliment ;-) and happy travels!"

","Absolutely perfect!","I have never been compelled to review a place on Trip Advisor before but my stay was so amazing it deserves the praise after our 6 night stay. The Viceroy is where I chose for my honeymoon and it was absolutely perfect. I would highly recommend it for a honeymoon, getaway, or rejuvenation trip. - the property is stunning with amazing architecture and every detail thought through. - you are surrounded by tranquility- the food was amazing. We had reservations booked in Ubud but canceled all but one night because we enjoy staying on the property and enjoying the food. - the staff was extremely kind and accommodating. Wonderful service!- I am not positive but I think they said the place was 75% full and we felt like we owned the place.- we recommend the sunrise volcano hike (early wakeup but worth it) and the massages are amazingIf I was to complain about anything it would be that there isn't another Viceroy in another part of the world. I would definitely travel there. We followed our stay at The Viceroy with 4 days in Phuket on the beach and it was the perfect compliment to our stay at the Viceroy. Thank you Viceroy!David C. USA"

","Don't bother staying any place else in Ubud.","What an amazing place! The attention to detail unsurpassed -- from the beautiful stone & woodwork down to the in-room amenities. Staff were lovely, food superb, owners were absolutely delightful, architecture and landscaping stunning & the views into the jungle were spectacular. From our terrace, we could see monkeys swinging through the trees! We spent HOURS on the balé and in the private pool (not wanting to leave our fabulous room, except of course for a luxurious spa treatment)! I gush… but for good reason. Can’t wait to book my next holiday here."

","Remote Paradise in Bali","I planned an extended 5 week trip from NJ to London, then Singapore, Phuket, Bali then Paris before returning to my home in The Garden State. After a week at the W Hotel in Seminyak we headed to the Luxury enclave of The St. Regis Bali. from there we decided to change the scenery all together and spend 2 glorious nights high above the rice fields at the Viceroy in Ubud. The property shines with exclusitivity from the moment you approach the private road to the resort and pass the Viceroy's private helipad. Even though we arrived by private car service and not a Helicopter we were greeted with the utmost joy and courtesy. The extremely attentive staff and front office manger quickly escorted us to our villa perched high on a cliffside with dramatic views of the rice fields and river far down below. Its a magnificent view and very tranquil, serene environment. The villas have their own very private infinity pool overlooking the cliffs. The pool area is adorned with Balinese statues and and lounge chairs. It is pure luxury in a palace like setting. This is the absolute perfect addition to any trip to Bali. There is no other choice of lodging in this area of this caliber. The Bali Zoo and the Monkey Forest are both very close. In addition Ubud is a artists town full of shops and cafe's and paintings. It is a fabulous town and definite place of interest that is not to be missed. although it is a short 1 hr drive from most Resort hotels , a brief one or two night stay here is very relaxing and enjoyable. The rooms are pure luxury, the food is impeccable and the service is exemplary. Take my advice..you will be happy you you did.!!"

","Simply Paradise!!!","As you pass the helipad you're greeted by a wide open lobby and smiling faces. Then you can call for a golf cart and driver that is happy to take you to your room. And this is where privacy & luxury meet. Your own private beautifully landscaped courtyard. A bedroom surrounded by glass on three sides opens to your courtyard. The bed is a grandiose oversized king fit for a fairy tale. The room is extremely large and spacious.Looking out at your own luscious courtyard with personal infinity pool is calming. Little hidden nooks of relaxation within the courtyard are everywhere.The entire bathroom area is outside, but still under the courtyard half covered roof. The actual toilet area looks through a glass area into a private atrium. The octagonal (big enough for 4 ppl) shower with multi-jets soothes every ache. But do not dismiss the spa because you will miss heaven. The spa experience is indescribable. No words do justice. Just do it!The main pool is worth a visit for sure. A huge infinity pool falling into a distant jungle landscape. You will wear the paint off your camera's shutter button here.The food... Let's just say they brought the fine dining experience of Paris to Bali. With lime sorbet between courses to cleanse your palet. Simply decadent. Even the flat rocks you step on situated in a trickling stream to get to your table is gorgeous and soothing as is every thing here. Elephant riding, the monkey forest and craftsman are just some of the once in a lifetime treats. Clearly this is one of the most beautiful and luxurious places on this earth. Last but not least, have your breakfast delivered directly to your room. You will love it. Our tour driver ""Ma-day"" is the BEST! Ask to visit the restaurant overlooking the volcano past the rice terraces and his favorite restaurant for ""Bobbi-guling"" (phonetic spelling). Your tastebuds will scream in ecstasy.On the fence? Don't be. This place is somewhere you'll never want to leave!"

","Very hard to leave","We stayed at the Viceroy for four nights. It was absolutely sublime, we had deluxe terrace villa 15 which had uninterrupted views of the forest and waterfalls at the bottoms of the gorge.The room was stunning open plan with doors that opened to our private pool. We hardly left the hotel while we were there. Everything had been thought of and the amenities were superb. We spent most of our days reading and dipping into the pool, it was invredibly comfortable, peaceful and relaxing. The room comes with complementary soft drinks and water and we were never lacking for anything.The breakfast was lovely, al la carte with a great selection of fruit, cereal, pastry and cooked breakfast. We also ate at the bar a few times for lunch and went to Cascades for dinner. The bar menu is limited but you are also able to order from the restaurant menu any time so the variety of food is very good.The hotel includes a transport service to ubud we used it a few times and it was so nice to know you could go into the town and have a ride home at the time you expected. The drivers were incredibly friendly.Overall the service was friendly and unobtrusive everything we asked for and sometimes didn't even have to ask for was done for us. Very thoughtful service.Our stay was just fantastic and I highly recommend the Viceroy."

","Paradise in the rice fields of Bali","The view from our villa overlooking the gorge and within view of the rice fields, was stunning! The layout of the villa, with it's indoor dipping pool and reclining bed was fabulous. The resort is perfectly laid out along the edge of the gorge and the outdoor infinity pool, very inviting on a hot day. Service, from the moment we were picked up to the moment we departed, was polite and courteous. Recommendations for dining and shopping were informative and accurate. The complimentary transport to Ubud was always available and on time. We also spent a wonderful afternoon at the spa being pampered. The facilities and services were most satisfying. Definitely a place to remember and return to."

","Beautiful secluded resort","The Viceroy is a bit pricey compared to other resorts in Ubud, but well worth the extra money. We chose this resort because it seemed to encompass everything that we were looking for. The resort is set in the beautiful countryside with the luxury of modern comforts and we were not bothered by any bugs at all, it is set in an immaculate clean well manicured environment. I was worried that the open bathroom would be covered in bugs, but it wasn't an issue. We went for a walk to Kamandula resort next door and were so glad that we chose the Viceroy, they are worlds apart in terms of quality, luxury and overall ambience. The hotel has a great shuttle service to and from Ubud centre, it's less than 10 minutes drive, and convenient to visit the lovely restaurants, explore the galleries etc. We booked a day tour with the hotel, and Gama, our driver and guide was very professional, friendly and knowledgable, I would definitely recommend him. The staff were all very helpful and friendly, the breakfast a good spread, rooms very commodious and all made for a perfect hotel choice in Ubud, we will definitely be returning!"

","You can't put a price on a stay like this","Yes, of course this place, I prefer the word ""retreat"", is expensive but how can you compare such a private and discreet sanctuary like this to anywhere else ? It is unique. We wanted to avoid the clamour of the beachside areas and The Viceroy gave us a chance to live for 2 blissful weeks in utter peace and quiet. We were never once disturbed by the cleaning team.We were left well alone and when we did need something a little motorised cart arrived within a couple of minutes. Many hotels in Perth could learn from the sincerity and good manners of the people who work there from the gardeners to the waiting staff in the restaurant or the charming reception staff. I can still see their calm, radiant faces as they tried their best to look after us. And how well they did.What we were after was that elusive quality of peacefulness that few commercial hotels can provide. To be left well alone to enjoy the pool in our stunning villa overlooking the forest and to be looked after only when we needed it. Not an easy task but they succeeded completely. Joy !Evening menu was not extensive but quite good and, at times, excellent. After 2 weeks you know it fairly well and we thought that it should have changed a little over that span with the addition of a few specials, maybe.There is a strong and irresistible feeling of spirituality about this sanctuary. It is invigorating for the soul and would suit busy, overworked folk trying to get away from it all. All around you is nature and this place sits reverently in it and is not imposed on it.The owners somehow manage to give you the feeling of being in a very Balinese setting but it is all very sophisticated underneath with very thoughtful touches in the rooms like water pouring through an elephant's trunk in the bath to the water fountain in the pool turning itself off automatically at around 8pm (although you can change this manually if you wish). The rooms have lovely high ceilings and they are beautifully air conditioned. Everything worked as it should. The owner was discreet and attentive and we felt welcome at all times.Oliver and Lavinia from Perth WABreakfast was the highlight for us. The choice of goodies being overwheming sometimes and we would sit for a long time after the meal gazing quietly at the jungle across the valley where villagefolk were working away at their tough lives on the land."

","5star Sanctuary","My husband I spent 5 days at Viceroy, our first holiday away in a very long time. We could not have been any happier with our choice. The Garden Villa we had was immaculate, the privacy and comfort of the villa with its own pool was perfect, and the view across to the jungle amazing. The staff were outstanding, and really helped make our stay extremely pleasant and relaxing. Nothing was too much trouble, and any requests we had were met promptly. We enjoyed every delicious meal we had in the restaurant. We really enjoyed the peaceful and tranquil setting of the Viceroy, and the fact that it is tucked away. Perfect place to hide away from a busy life for a little while, and just relax and refresh the soul."

","This place is awesome - very discreet","I came here with my girlfriend and it was fabulous. Can I start by saying the best thing about this place is its staff. They are an absolute credit to this hotel. From the greeting by the lady on reception, to the gardeners going about their daily business, everyone gave us a very warm welcome. Conversation was cheery and English was impeccable. They can not be faulted. The hotel itself is amazing. The way that the rooms were crafted is probably the most unique I've seen for a while. A personal pool in every room is just to be seen. The hotel is bijoux but you get the feel that it is organically expanding. You can see where it started and how it has developed with new villas being built now which will be finished next year; and why not. We ate mostly at the hotel and the food is nicely presented. I thought the evening menu was limited but considering there are only about 21 villas, they cater for their size. Breakfast was great (not buffet) and served to you as you overlook the beautiful scenery. If you order room service, the food comes really quickly and is served with care.Hotel grounds are amazing and the ornate stone looks chiselled to perfection. My only concern (which is really nit-picking) is that I thought that the room felt slightly dated. Don't get me wrong, these are excellent rooms but have been well used/loved. We were in a garden villa and on consideration I should have plucked for a terrace villa as they get more sun as they are elevated higher so our room felt in the shadow (yes - I had room jealousy). If I could use three words to highlight my experience it would be tranquil, service and warmth. Definitely go."

","Overpriced for Bali, but We Had a Lovely Time Here.","Viceroy Bali is a luxury villa complex just a few minutes from the main street in Ubud. It is perched on a jungle-draped hillside where your view from your villa and the restaurant is jungle with a few spots of rice fields, where you can watch the farmers at work while you eat breakfast. Monkeys were swinging from the trees outside our villa, birds and butterflies (and geckos) were everywhere. The only problem really with Viceroy is that Bali is flush with luxury villas now at half the price as Viceroy - many that are equally or more impressive. It's just overpriced compared to the market. That said, our week long stay here was lovely.The villas are built on the hillside, so something to think about if you have mobility issues. We were at the closest villa to the restaurant, and still it was a bit of a hike up the hillside to get there. They can bring a golf cart to get you but that can take some time, and it can't go past the stairs, so prepare for some hiking.LOCATION - There is nothing within walking distance of the villa, so you will take the free shuttle into Ubud, only a few minutes. The shuttle was easy to use, the vehicles were very nice, and the drivers were pleasant.VILLAS - We were in a 1-BR terrace villa. It was lovely, well taken care of, with fantastic floor-to-ceiling windows that we put our desk up against so we could watch the monkeys swinging from the trees while we were working. There is an outdoor plunge pool and day bed - it is a plunge pool, really small, you won't be swimming - it's just there to cool you down. If it rains then it gets all muddy, but it only rained on our last day. The villa was pleasant and spacious, no complaints except they were stingy with the Nespresso coffee - only two per day. When we asked for more they gave us like 30, overflowing all over the table.FOOD - I think we had everything on the menu during our week long stay. The overall concensus was bland, massively overpriced, tasteless, and quite ordinary - nothing was bad, just nothing was something to remember either. The menu is almost entirely Western with only a few Indonesian dishes that didn't taste Indonesian (had no taste). Well presented for sure, every dish had 5-star presentation, just the food itself was kind of 3-star. Plan to go out in Ubud for better food and way lower prices. Bridges in particular we had a great experience at. The wine is exorbitantly priced, as are the drinks - you don't realize how much they are until you venture out into Ubud, even at nice tourist restaurants, and see the prices everywhere else. Wine list was small, just a couple wines by the glass, which never changed, were expensive and not very good.The staff in the restaurant were wonderful, so nice and pleasant, we looked forward to seeing them every day. There is great live piano music in the bar every other day, but it stops at 10:00 so make sure to eat dinner early if you want to enjoy it afterward. The bar staff are a lot of fun too. The view and atmosphere of the restaurant was lovely, just so bland and overpriced food.BUSINESS - There is free wi-fi in the villas which was fast and worked well throughout our stay. A big enough desk we could both sit at it and be on the computer at the same time, overlooking the gorgeous valley. There are 2 computers for guest internet use and a conference room. A good place to stay if you have a bit of business to do as we did.STAFF - To a tee, the staff was amazing - so friendly, so helpful, so personable, just made you feel warm and fuzzy inside all the time. The absolute best part about being at Viceroy. Front desk managers made you feel so welcome each and every day, and the restaurant staff were a joy. The room was spotlessly cleaned every day, the only thing I thought was weird is I had to close my own curtains every night. But I think they expect you'll take a plunge pool after dinner and they light up the patio. We had endless frustration with only one thing - the timing of the housekeeping staff. At every other 5-star resort we've stayed at, the room is cleaned while you are at breakfast, turn down is done while you are at dinner, the housekeeping is invisible. Not here. They ring your doorbell every morning to try to come clean the room, even when the DND sign is up, you have to walk outside and up the stairs to tell them to come back when you're at breakfast. Same thing with turndown - ring the doorbell, can we do turndown? No! I'm still in the room! No matter how many times we would tell them it never changed. Very annoying. Even more annoying was that then we'd come back from breakfast and the room hadn't been cleaned yet, even when we specifically asked for a certain time, and we had to do it all over again at lunch and enjoy a dirty room all morning. Also odd was that we were there the whole week, the owner knew who we were, yet never once introduced himself. He talked to us a couple of times, but we just thought he was another guest. Strange for a 5-star place where the owner is present onsite.These downsides definitely do not detract from the overall lovely experience we had at Viceroy, but after seeing the prices of other well-reviewed luxury villas in Bali, especially in light of the very expensive (for Bali) restaurant, it really is overpriced compared to the competition. Great place, fabulous time, wonderful staff made every day a joy. Just doesn't need to cost that much, needs to train the housekeeping, and work on the food a bit. Otherwise perfect!"

","Second Visit, First Class","For the second time this year I visited the Viceroy, in May with a girlfriend, and this time with my husband. We had a Garden Villa which was luxurious to say the least with all amenities you would wish.As yet again, the staff were very accommodating and respectful and the meals at Cascades were exceptional. This time we had High Tea which was extremely adequate and just enough for us before another delicious evening meal.Another massage was in order , which was enjoyed by both of us. The Hotel has such a calming and tranquil ambience, that we almost did nothing except curl up with some good books, enjoying our restful and relaxing surroundings. Will be back yet again,not even bothering to seek out other hotels."

Victoria
","Live like a Queen (or King)!","I am generally not a person for expensive hotels or posh resorts particuarly when staying in Asia as I prefer to be immersed in the local cultural but I have to say this place is an exception! :) We (myself, my husband and our young son) only stayed here for 2 nights (which was probably the perfect escape from reality time for us) as I got it as a mystery deal on Wotif.com for US $100/night. We actually got picked up from a cheap family run bungalow we were staying at in Monkey Forest road and were transported to the Viceroy in their luxury air-conditioned van. We had seen the pictures of the garden villa (the cheapest room) online, but nothing prepared us for seeing it in real life, my husband and I were speechless, we couldn't stop laughing and smiling like we'd won the lottery. Everything about the villa and staying there was pure luxury. The highlight for me was the bathroom, where you could sit in the bath and look over the view of the stunning valley.Sipping my gin and tonic while getting ready for a night out with my husband in that gorgeous bathroom with a view I truly did feel like royalty! :) We made use of the babysitting service offered by the hotel to go out for a night which also made me feel very special getting picked up in the golf buggy and once again transported in the luxury van to a trendy cafe in Ubud. We knew our son would be in safe hands so could relax and have a good time. All of the staff were lovely, but as it was low season while we were staying there (and not many guests) we felt that the owner was disappointed that we didn't attend one of the special dinners they put on for guests. But to be honest it would have really blown our budget to go and we would much rather eat at a cute little cheap cafe in Ubud town. Breakfast wasn't anything special, although can't comment on other meals which I'm sure were lovely. I wouldn't say this is the most child-friendly place to stay in terms of the design of the villa, as the floors are all marble and there is a plunge pool (although you can lock the doors to keep your little one inside the room and away from danger). It's definitely a place for couples, but we still had a magical time staying as a family. The plunge pool was actually quite cool temperature wise, but still fun to take a dip. The only little thing that was not perfect was that we had wasps flying in and out of the vent of our bath occasionally, but since we're not regular 5-star travellers this didn't bother us too much! It was all the little touches such as the luxury tea and coffee and the turn-down service with the beautiful smelling robes and little gifts that made our stay dream-like! :) I doubt I will get the chance to stay at the Viceroy again or anywhere as nice as this, so I'd say it's definitely a once in a life-time experience. If anyone asked me where they should go for a honeymoon I would say here for sure!"

","One word sums it all up ""Fantastic""","After staying at the Viceroy in Ubud there would only be one word I could use to describe it. ""Fantastic"". Upon check in, we were greeted with friendly, well spoken staff who gave my wife and I leis made from frangipanis and a pleasant iced tea as a welcome drink. We were checked in with zero fuss and taken to our room by electric buggy. Our porter clearly explained the layout of the grounds on the way to our room as well as how everything worked in our room. We stayed in a Deluxe Terrace Villa (room 15), note if you are booking a Deluxe Terrace Villa, room 15 & 16 have completely unobstructed views of the gorge and river below. The room is above 5 star, extremely clean, very luxurious styled with a Balinese theme. It has a high thatched ceiling, ducted air conditioning, wall safe, free wifi that works well and is fast, a large plasma tv around 50 inch with satellite tv channels, dvd player, a sound system for you iPod / iPhone, an espresso coffee machine with free coffee pods, a good selection of Twining teas, a minibar with free soft drinks and juice, milk, water etc. The room features a large comfortable lounge, an extremely comfortable, larger than king size bed, writing desk, walk in wardrobe with large hanging space and drawers as well as room for your bags. The room also has great lighting, led reading lights for the bed, dimming mood lights etc. The bathroom features a large stone bath, his and hers vanities, separate toilet and a shower that features a massive rain shower, and a normal shower rose to top it off. In the courtyard, your private infinity pool looks spectacular as it appears to flow over the edge in to the gorge below. The courtyard also features traditional, and again i use the word ""spectacular"" and luxurious balè. It actually hangs over the gorge. It has a comfortable corner cushion style lounge with pillows and a table where you can even have your breakfast served, or in the late afternoon enjoy a drink while watching the monkeys leap from tree to tree in the gorge. They have thought of all the smallest details like a power point in the balè for your iPad charger etc. This makes this an incredible and relaxing outdoor area. The restaurant, ""Cascades"" is also 5 star. We had dinner there and we're treated like VIP's. Nothing was a problem for the staff who again went out of there way to make the whole experience special. The food was great! Taste and presentation was what you would expect to see in fine dining restaurants anywhere in the world. Cascades also features a very extensive wine list, as well as beers, juices, soft drinks. To sum up, I would highly recommend the Viceroy in Ubud if you are looking for a special place to have a great relaxing break.Steve & DeniseAustralia"

","Heaven on Earth","Wow what a amazing hotel, I had a 3 night package there and wished it was 3 weeks, everything abouth the terrace villa was 5 star, so luxurious and amazing views across the green hills along with the odd monkey climbing in the trees. The gardens and grounds al perfectly presented and so peaceful and relaxing in the whole resort. Big cudos to having a coffee maker and iPod player in each villa, the bathroom was huge and had nice deep bath and large shower with two vanities, the downside being the bath oils/soaps were not very nice in fact both myself and a friend who stayed in another villa at Viceroy thought they smelt pretty awful.The food was good but would not rave about it, the breakfast a bit boring but I loved the toast and the french butter, I was surprised that if you wanted breakfast in your room you would be charged extra each time, it is not something that I've had happen before in Bali.But I would definatley recommend this hotel, you really don't want to leave the resort it is so relaxing and the staff are gracious and attentive, love it there and am saving to go back lol!"

","In a word...magic.","We spent 5 nights at The Viceroy at the end of August and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We stayed in Garden Villa 6 and despite the fact that this is the Viceroy's entry level villa, it was amazing. Chilling on the large Balinese daybed staring out at the jungle and watching the mist rise from the river in the morning was so peaceful. Amenities at the resort itself was fantastic. Breakfasts were filling and well made, dinner at CasCades delicious and beautifully presented. The views are breathtaking, the staff so warm and friendly. The spa and treatments live up to the excellence that the resort operates with after treatment views that keep you ultra-relaxed. Anything that you need is accommodated by the team at The Viceroy. We were fortunate to have Made as our driver for a day and he was wonderful...friendly and able to give us a full view of the Balinese countryside.

","Simply Perfect","Having recently returned from 7 wonderful nights at the Viceroy, it certainly lived up to it's name. From the pick up at the airport we were greeted by our driver, provided with cold towels and cold bottled water for the long drive to Ubud. Paying US$25.00 was indeed handy for express immigration to avoid the queues at the airport. Contact the hotel in advance and they will arrange this for you and it will be added to your bill upon checkout. You are greeted by a hotel representative and escorted through immigration, luggage is then collected for you and then you are escorted out of the terminal to your driver. The deluxe terrace villa was beautiful, clean and modern with all amenities provided including robes, slippers, i pod docking station, lilly coffee pods for the coffee machine, complimentary non alcoholic mini bar drinks and plenty of toiletries. I recommend staying in the lower section of the resort as the villas have uninterrupted views of the valley and jungle, but be prepared for a steep walk up the hill to access the resort's facilities. The outdoor area of the villa is of a good size for 2 people, featuring plunge pool, sunbaking lounge, outdoor tables and chairs. Breakfast, lunch and dinner is served at Cascades Restaurant which has lovely views and you can also dine in your room if you wish. We ordered room service for dinner one evening and 20 minutes later our outdoor table was transformed into a restaurant dinner table with a white table cloth, cutlery and our dinner was promptly served and we felt like we were dining in a restaurant but with the added romance, views and privacy of our own space. The spa at the resort was excellent with trained staff providing wonderful massages. The petal bath in the day spa was just beautiful. The resort provides a complimentary drop off and pick up service at 2 locations in ubud throughout the day and come evening will drop you off at your destination and will return to pick you up at your chosen time. A small fee is charged if your destination is outside the designated ubud area. The service provided by the staff was exceptional, they made us feel very welcome and were quick to respond to any requests or questions we had. There is plenty to do and see in ubud from the day spas, exploring cafes and restaurants, visiting the monkey forest to venturing out of ubud to visit rice paddy fields. If you are looking to spoil yourself then I would certainly recommend the Viceoy, whilst not cheap it was certainly worth it and would definitely stay there again."

","over the top but in a good way","The Viceroy lived up to its name: regal, opulent, a bit colonial. In some ways it was a bit much for our style -- but we admit we really enjoyed it. Extraordinary (large!) villa, nice pool, simply magical views. The structure of the entry door to the villa was a bit treacherous and poorly designed-- an easy fix we hope they make! Easy to get in and out of town via their taxis; good food and nice people."

","A true five star experience","There are not many places where you find such a perfect balance between friendly service and perfect hotel infrastructure. The spacious villas offer all amenities you would expect. A private pool and terrace gives you the opportunity to relax very privately. We have never been in an Asian Hotel which was that clean and well maintained - a big praise to the owner family!But the best thing of all is the kind and friendly service of the hotel crew. They are there to serve, literally! They want to make you happy with all their possibilities. Great! A lot of hotels can cut a slice out of this!We can recommend it to everybody!"

","Paradise in Bali","The Viceroy is a stunning hotel in every sense of the word! We stayed for an idyllic 6 nights at the end of August as part of our Honeymoon trip to Bali. The hotel itself is very elegant, the scenery is breathtaking and our villa was exceptionally comfortable. It was however the staff that made our stay truly memorable. Everyone was so friendly, nothing was ever too much trouble. For us the Viceroy had the perfect blend of grand luxury without being ostentatious or impersonal. For anyone looking for a hotel that's a bit special in Ubud then the Viceroy is the place for you!"

","No value for money","The location is beautiful, in the middle of rice fields but coming from Uma Ubud, we found a great difference. Our room was a garden view, with a nice ""indoor pool"" and an XXL bed. Apart on this the impression on the room is that it is much older than its six years. Not surprising, if you see how the owner (an Austrian man) is heading around dressing like a sloppy tourist. Same impression from the breakfast, served with paper napkins (at 600 usd a night???). Service was good but not excellent and the restaurant quite slow, especially for the breakfast. First day we were told bread and croissant had finished and they could serve only toasted bread (AT 600 usd A NIGHT???). In theory there is a complimentary van driving in and out from Ubud at no charge but if the hotel is full you must be lucky to get a ride."

","The best place to visit Bali","Such a beautiful place! Such a good restaurant! Such a nice staff! Such a lovely room! Calm, luxury, kindliness! I recommend particularly this hotel in Ubud, very well centraly situated to go and visit Ubud or other spots around. Particularly for honeymooners or even friends or families in Bali. Thank you very much for their reception."

","Amazing setting and views and so relaxing","We stayed at the Viceroy for 3 glorious nights at the beginning of July for our 24th Wedding Anniversary and were very impressed with the quality of the villas and the lovely friendly staff. By far the best place we have stayed in. We both wanted to just relax and chill out and Viceroy ticks all the boxes if that is what your looking for. We had booked into a deluxe pool villa but were upgraded to a Vice Regal Villa on check in (with own pool) which is amazing, lying in bed in the mornings, looking out across the valley, so private and magical, such a nice start to the day.Had everything you would need in the villa for a relaxing time. Had room service on the first night and our meal was at our door within 15 minutes of making the call and was very nice. We were pampered at the spa with a great massage and body exfolliant, very luxurious and staff lovely.We have to mention Gama who picked us up from the Airport and on our second day took us on a tour of the Volcano, Coffee plantation, rice fields and Temple, he was very helpful and friendly, nothing was too much trouble, a credit to your business. The restaurant, bar and affinity pool area (although too cold to swim in when we were there) is beautiful and very peaceful and calming with amazing views across the valley. Lovely food and staff very friendly and efficient.Would highly recommend this place for any couples wanting to de-stress and get away from it all."

","I'd like to give full marks, but its not quite there .........","On a few counts, Viceroy is just brilliant, but there are ways to enhance the guest experience. Starting with the positives, The Viceroy provides most of the benefits of a large hotel, but an intimate environment with relatively few guests at any time because of its size - Bravo! Willingness and flexibility of staff - Bravo, just what you need when you are making things up as you go along (as we were) and do not want too much structure. WiFi included - BRAVO!But I still cannot work out why they were not at the airport when my flight, admittedly 15 minutes early, arrived and I was looking for the smiling face of Bali with my name card. Thank goodness (as my phone refused to work) the hotel agency at the airport kindly rang the Viceroy to shake things along and someone turned up, aware my flight was coming in early AND that my partner on a different flight had been delayed, I just feel I should not have had to search the hotel drivers' line four or five times!At the hotel, the staff are willing, but often we found their English and cultural awareness to be at a lower level than we are used to in hotels of this standard. Even my partner who is fluent in Bahasa reacted the same way.Breakfast was our big gripe, the food was DULL, DULL, DULL - it felt (but was not intended to be) ""mean"" and the staff lacked the enthusiasm, sense of generosity, eagerness which really makes a difference first thing in the day. And the food was truly not much beyond what you expect and get at a three star buffet establishment. (Having written this, my reflection is that the staff lack the sponteneity, confidence and engagement we are used to making smaller hotels a special experience. Always smiling, always willing, but not engaged with the guests!)We ate in the restaurant on one night and although more interesting, we felt the food was preprepared and over priced for what it was.Would we go back? Not necessarily. For us, it fell between the kind of comfort and pampering you expect in the top line hotels, and the freedom of a real villa, with a real pool. We would probably prefer to pay more and get more, or less and have the freedom of our own place."

","AMAZING! PRIVATE! TOTAL LUXURY!","we just returned from our 9 year anniversary trip to the viceroy and have RAVE reviews to post! The staff were so helpful in the planning of our trip with quick and helpful responses to all my many many questions about the area! The VIP immigration service they offer was huge and so nice to be pampered and not wait in lines at the airport! Upon arrival to this tiny botique resort we were IN HEAVEN!!! From the lush manicured grounds, the swanky helicopter pad at the entrance, the grand marble foyer, to the friendly staff, it was just gorgeous! What we loved most was how small it was...this allowed them to be very detailed in their service and know us and made it very personal, they didn't miss a thing and we had total privacy and seclusion, rarely saw other couples! We stayed in Terrace Villa 1 and it has THE BEST views and was just incredible! Walking into the room seeing that amazing plunge pool w/ the bale' suspended over it, WOW!!!!!!!!! The villa was MASSIVE and all marble! So fancy yet so comfortable. One entire wall is glass so you see out to the jungle, yet all windows and doors can be completely covered so you can still sleep in the dark in the mornings. The bathroom area was insane! The TV was huge, ipod speakers huge, wonderful coffee amenities and did I mention fabulous stocked mini bar that was complimentary!? We had breakfast served in our bale each morning and it was always delicious, fit for a king and on time, served with a smile! We spent the majority of our vacation here just reading, eating, relaxing and being pampered! They offered us their driver and nice SUV's to be taken around town in but I would recommend using the resort's scooter and venturing out into the local areas, the rice fields and villages. Ubud is nice to see but we enjoyed getting away from all the commercial stuff and by scooter was the way to go! We would also recommend Nomad's for dinner in Ubud, excellent food and fun views of the busy town. We did a couples 2 hour massage and yogurt scrub there at the Viceroy spa and it was HEAVEN!! Total pampering and ended with a couples hot bath in a luxurious tub filled with petals and a refreshing drink! They really took time to honor our anniversary and did little surprises for us through the week to celebrate it including one night when we were coming home they brought us an anniversary cake, another night when we got home they had drawn a hot bath in our huge tub and filled it with flowers! They didn't miss a detail! I can't say enough good things about this place and can't think of anything negative at all! You will be SO HAPPY if you come visit, the most peaceful, beautiful place in the middle of the jungle, overlooking a river gorge with top notch staff and luxurious villas and private plunge pools, how can you not love it?!?!?! PS. we stayed here for our first 5 nights and ended our last 2 nights at the beach. However, I would not recommend Bali for it's beaches now after going and seeing several of them. They are beautiful and nice, yes, but nothing spectacular like you may see in Bora Bora or Fiji. Also the beach areas, even though we chose one away from all the touristy stuff (Jimbaran), seem very commercial and lack the true culture vibe of Bali that is found off the beaten path in Ubud. We for sure enjoyed our time at the beach and exploring Uluwatu area especially but if you can't decide, I think you would be just as happy staying here in paradise your whole trip! :)"

","Simply our high expectations exceeded!","My wife and I stay at the Viceroy for our honeymoon in early June 2012. We had been recommended by friends and after reviewing the hotel online we decided this would be ideal place to stay for our once in a life time holiday. You could say our expectations were high.Well, our expectations were exceeded! It was the small things that set it apart, the extra touches, the thought and delivery were so carefully considered that our stay was made personal and special. So much so we are currently planning out return next year. In addition to the above, our time at the Viceroy was further enhanced by the owners Otto and Margret who kindly took the trouble to get to know us and ensured our every need was looked after. The Viceroy is a complement and credit to their passion and hard work and we can't wait to return."

","Beautiful Spa Hotel in Ubud","My husband I have had a tough year and before embarking on our next Expatriate assignment my wonderfully husband treated us both to a short getaway. With the help of a fantastic friend, a Trip Advisor reviewer and a lovely Travel Agent we came across the Viceroy Spa in Ubud.The scenery was lovely. The rooms were spectacular. We stayed in one of the Garden rooms which have their own plunge pool. Sadly the pool was very cold due to it not getting any sun. The staff at the hotel were so very helpful and were happy to change rooms for us. In the middle of it all the staff graciously upgraded us to a Terrace room that also had a plunge pool. This pool received quite a bit of sun together with some warm water coming through the fountain into the pool.All of the staff were fantastic and most accommodating. The food was good too. The Spa they have on site is also really good with both my husband and feeling it is the best massage we have ever had.I would highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to get away from it all and just relax. Not a place to take children.Well Done to all concerned at the Viceroy, Ubud."

","BEYOND OUR EXPECTATIONS!","My best friend and I spent 4 nights at Viceroy and this vacation turned out to be our best one ever. We cannot wait to go back there already. We were wowed as soon as we arrived at the lobby and front dest staff made us feel very special. The view from the lobby was breathtaking and the view from the pool area was so unreal. We kept saying it looked so fake that it was like we were looking at a huge painting. The villa was absolutely gorgeous!! Our villa was Delux terrance villa where there was a pool, big bathtab, 2 bathroom sinks, a big couch, tv and everything. We had breakfast at the bale and it was fantastic! All staff were very friendly and we appreciate their hospitality so very much. The stomospher at the bar was amazing and cocktails were delicious. We had an opportunity to speak with the Owner as well. He is such a wonderful person. I don't remember how many times we said we felt like we were dreaming..... i highly recommend this place for honeymooners, couples and group of girls. The 24 hour cab service was very convenient as well. Again, nothing to complain about! This place was beyond our expectations!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

","Romance at its highest..!","We stayed here for three nights on our honeymoon and we were delighted with our choice. We needed some peace and quiet after our wedding and this was exactly what the doc ordered! We were blown away by the setting as soon as we arrived; we were greeted with a cold drink and a garland of frangipani flowers, and escorted to our villa by golf buggy. We were grinning from ear to ear! We had booked a terrace villa which was spectacular. So much so that we hardly left our room for three days! The room was huge, with a massive bed, bath, shower, private terrace and pool. The views were amazing too, and we even got the odd glimpse of monkeys!! The staff were lovely and extremely helpful - nothing was too much trouble. The food was wonderful although a little expensive, in comparisons to other high end hotels on the island. A very romantic spot and somewhere we will never forget - a great place for honeymooners or if you want to pop the question ;) We will definitely come back but as it is so quiet and remote, we felt three nights was perfect. Must mention the spa, which must have one of the most breathtaking settings we've witnessed. Lovely girls and we would recommend the coupes massage ;) Overall, a spectacular hotel and worth the money."

","A Beautiful Property & an immaculate staff to boot.","Viceroy's location is great, so close to the heart of Ubud, yet still manage to keep its exclusive secluded feel. We stayed at the terrace villa, and I have to admit I could get used to waking up to green lushness and beautiful spread of breakfast at the little gazebo on top of the pool overlooking the valley everyday! Viceroy's staff is not only friendly, they cater to your every whims, quick on their feet, but still managed to keep their distance when not requested thus keeping your privacy. If you're looking for a honeymoon stay and/or luxury getaway, don't think twice about Viceroy. Unfortunately, the food in the Cascade Restaurant wasn't up to par with the reviews. I would highly suggest getting the concierge book you a table at Mosaic (which they did and even got us a copy of the menu for our reference before the meal, and a shuttle to and fro). Ubud is my favorite destination in Bali, and I am so happy to have experienced a stay at Viceroy, I will be sure to be back soon!"

","Heavenly!","This review is actually a year late (we stayed in June 2011) but I still remember every perfect detail to this day! Viceroy was the first stop on our honeymoon. Although The beginning of our stay was slightly dampened because my husband was suffering from severe headaches (which turned out to be an acute case of sinus infection), the staff at Viceroy did all they could to help & they all knew him by name & would ask how he was doing. It got so bad one day that we called the reception & asked for a doctor to come and take a look at him to which they were so accommodating & understanding. The doctors gave him some strong painkillers but wasn't able to diagnose the sinus infection & we don't blame him, there were no symptoms except for the constant headache. Over breakfast one day, one of the lovely waiters offered to make him a tea called lomi lomi to make him feel better, we fell in love with it and had each day till we left. we still reminisce about it to this day. I cannot say enough about the amazing, friendly & helpful staff!!We stayed in a garden villa. It was very spacious and the bed was very big & comfy, it was impossible to get out of. The shower is outside which was a weird experience at first but the entire setting is gorgeous and the view of the trees outside is breathtaking. The only downside was the pool which we didn't use at all because it was so cold but it wasn't a big deal because the main pool is also gorgeous and was empty most of the time. Breakfast was very good but the only reason I gave it 4 stars is its limited variety but that can be our fault because they always told us that they could prepare anything outside the menu but we just never bothered, it was good enough. We cannot stress enough how convenient the free shuttle to Ubud is! The hotel is just a short ride away & we were able to go anytime we wanted & would arrange for them to bring us back when we wanted. Walking around Ubud is a lot of fun and you can buy souvenirs from there but beware the market! you have to bargain A LOT!! even when you think you've bargained enough, bargain some more, it's a tourist trap! & even when you buy from the shops, check your receipt, we bought some things from this one shop with a receipt & everything & after leaving we discovered they charged for something we didn't buy. When my husband felt better, we had the hotel arrange for us a day trip and we were shown around some temples and we drove around mount Batur etc. I think we paid around $100 - $120 for this. Overall, it was a perfect stay all round despite the rough beginning. We would definitely love to go back and I don't think there's a day that goes by without thinking about this charming hotel."

","Completely Beautiful and Perfect!","It's a little bit scary wondering why Viceroy isn't #1 on Trip Advisors Ubud Hotel list. How could anything actually be any better than this lovely place? Is it because it isn't as old or established as some of the other resorts and therefore I should keep quiet so I'll always be able to book here? It was so wonderful I can't really keep it quiet, especially as the staff, facilities, rooms, grounds, view, day spa and restaurant deserve to have their excellent abilities commended to the rest of the world. We had the most perfect holiday based here. We were in a deluxe terrace villa and ensured we spent at least one day lounging by our own private pool and bale. We booked a day tour with the hotel and spent a fantastic day with Ruka our driver and guide. After which we were grounded enough to book a scooter from the hotel and went native with the Ubud traffic. Very fun and we explored everywhere, however I would recommend only an experienced rider to do the same. Breakfast and dinner at the Cascade restaurant was excellent. We enjoyed two romantic dinners with our own private menu surrounded by petals in the shape of a heart. We also booked two 2 hour treatments at the Lembah day spa, one hour of massage the rest with a body treatment followed by a soak in a beautiful flower filled bath. Can't wait till we return ......."

","Absolutely World Class","My friend and I have just returned from the Viceroy Ubud. We found the place was absolutely perfect. The staff were very attentive and polite and the breakfast and food all round was excellent and top quality.We had a Deluxe Terrace Villa with twin beds, a beautiful plunge pool, which was sometimes a little cold, but that was because of the month and the weather. The Spa was one of the most relaxing and the staff had great sense of humours, and very attentive and caring to our needs. .I would thoroughly recommend this Hotel to anyone who wants a relaxing and quiet time for their holiday. The carts were fabulous as the property is very hilly and they are at your beck and call 24 hours a day. I say well done to Otto and Margaret. They have indeed created a beautiful and relaxing haven in a quiet and serene situation, with one of the best restaurants in the world."

It was even bigger and more beautiful than we expected. The room was very large with your own terrace and swimming pool and an amazing view on a beautiful green forest. The service was excellent. My wife who is pregnant was looking forward to a Bintang Zero already for the whole holiday and although they did not have it, they immediately arranged it for here. The taxi service from the hotel to Ubud is very convenient so nothing to withhold you form having dinner in Ubud. So if you go to Ubud and you can afford it you shoud stay here."

","Sensuous indulgence","My wife and I found this to be a classy property with a great wow factor. The wows and grins keep coming from the moment you step out of the hotel MPV into the welcoming lobby and reception, through to the flowing lower lobby, dramatic infinity pool and marvelous restaurant and bar overlooking dense forest and a flowing river. The wows continued when we were ushered into the stylish elegance of our Deluxe Terrace Villa - huge room, soaring traditional grass thatched ceiling, delightful amenities like the illy coffee machine and B&W Zeppelin iPod player. The bath area (it’s too large to be called a room) was simply marvelous. I enjoyed the huge long bath and big Grohe rain shower head. Step outside and you see the beautifully styled hanging pavilion or bale, next to the private and surprisingly deep plunge pool with an infinity view over the forest and river below. As you can tell, I could stay here quite comfortably for a long time.Trips to Ubud were easy with a car service and pick up at your beck and call. For instance, we had dinner at Ibu Rai’s and then asked the driver to swing by Bebek Benggil to pick up a few slices of decadent Black Russian Pie on the way back to the hotel. Nothing was too much trouble, unlike real life, which is something we could get used to!After a while, we noticed that although nature is all around the Viceroy, it is kept strictly at bay by formidable planning and impressive structures. This is not one of those resorts where you feel as if you are smack in the forest. It’s less raw and visceral and softened by a good dose of luxury. Any negatives? Well, we had dinner at Cascades on our first night and while the food was enjoyable and well prepared, the environment was almost unbearably hot. I was sweltering and quite uncomfortable throughout the meal. There is no air conditioning, not even a ceiling fan at their only restaurant. I found out that this is quite common in Bali, even at higher end establishments. So if it’s a still and humid night, be prepared! It’s worth mentioning that there was quite a bit of knocking and construction going on at the Viceroy while we were there in late April/early May. On the first morning, our breakfast reverie was interrupted by up to 2 chainsaws going full bore across the river at about 9am and showed no signs of abating even at 11am. There was also intermittent hammering from the construction of some new villas on the property. These sounds were loud and could clearly be heard even in our villa with the doors closed! With that kind of racket, we needed little encouragement to spend the late mornings and afternoons in Ubud or on day excursions. Even the alluring spa building was undergoing some kind of renovation so massages had to be done in our villa. The massage experience was only so-so as the masseurs seem to be just going through the motions. Relaxing, yes. Special, no. All in all, we had a good stay and would certainly consider going back but probably after the construction is over."

","Very well built small boutique hotel - great expensive escape","My wife booked this via an internet deal, a package for 2, 4D3N at Deluxe Terrace Villa, 1 Romantic dinner, 1 couple spa, and airport transfers - for $1000. Viceroy Bali is situated not too far from Ubud town center (5 mins by car), surrounded by padi fields, and sitting on the ledge of a valley overlooking the other side - a great view, relaxing and undeveloped. It's a small boutique hotel, a fairly small swimming pool, one restaurant, a spa centre, well equiped gym, library with an extensive range of DVDs free to use in your room (if you find the time).I must say, the hotel is very well built, a lot of attention is given into the layout, design and decor. It's very tastefully done - made us felt really relaxed. It wasn't too crowded when we were there, and so it felt like we were in our very own large bungallow. The room is one of the best rooms I've been in (I've stayed in various 5 star resorts in Asia), large and well laid out bathroom, nice lounging area, high quality AV, great bed, a large balcony with your very own dipping pool, overlooking nature. We spent a lot of time in the room, it's super relaxing. One room for improvement, introduce more nature to the place (apart from mossies), birds, fish, fruit bats... to give it life (create natural habitats for them)One downside though, when we were there, they were working on some renovations/extensions, and by morning... we'd hear the banging of the works. Well, this is not a permanent feature, but just... bad luck for us.We had a balinese 2 hour spa treatment in our room, and it's very good. The masseuse very skillful, it felt genuine and I was totally relaxed. It did feel a little bit short though, an extra 15 minutes of kneading wouldve topped it. But, it's still good!As for the ""software"" of the place, staff are generally very helpful, responsive and friendly. Most of them speak very good english. However, we couldn't shake off the feeling though, (some, not all), sometimes it didn't feel natural or genuine... it's a strange feeling, and somehow has lost a little bit of the local-balinese hospitality. It felt - programmed somewhat. I think there is room for improvement here.Viceory has only one restaurant, which is fine, it's a great place to take sip your cocktail and again has an excellent view. However, we were quite taken aback by the quality of the menu and the food served. I think during the day time, the head chef is not on duty, we had the local fried rice and noodles, and it's quite bad. The breakfast served is... also not good (apart from the toast). There is major room for improvement here. Dinner, I must say was much better, and this is how we felt that the head chef is only on duty for dinner. So Viceroy, you'd really need to up your mark here.Will I come back again? I'm not sure, mxed feelings here - certainly not for the normal rates, I think one can get much better value else where. But if a good deal comes by again, I'll consider it. But if price is not your concern, then this is one place I'd recommend for a quick and relaxing break"

","Viceroy Bali, simply brilliant","My wife and I have just returned from a short 3 night break in Bali. We have visited Ubud before but this was our first time staying at the Viceroy. From the moment we arrived and looked out on to the wonderful vista from the reception desk, we felt relaxed and were treated to a brilliant experience. My wife chose a Deluxe Terrace Villa for our stay at the Viceroy. The Villa had everything you required, beautifully styled and outfitted. The King size bed was super comfortable and the shower had the biggest showerhead I have ever seen.We dined on the first night in Cascades Restaurant, a special meal and our table was surrounded by scattered flowers, very romantic. The food was superb, great flavours and presentation. Our package included breakfast each morning, plenty of choice from the a la carte menu. So nice not to eat from the standard pedestrian buffets most properties serve up.We had a massage in our room, very good and finished off with a bath, again drowned in flowers. Next time I would have a treatment in the day spa which looks fantastic.The best part about the Viceroy though is the staff. From all of the drivers, concierge, front desk, restaurant, housekeepers we were treated like royalty. The thing you remember most about Bali is those wonderful genuine smiles from the staff. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff from our special requests. All in all one of the best experiences we have had travelling the world. I would gladly recommend the Viceroy and think that for what you receive it is money well spent. Well done to the wonderful team at the Viceroy."

","I'm sure we'll come again","In our 10-day honeymoon trip in Bali, we stayed in Viceroy Bali for 2 days.We had a great dinner in Cascades Restaurant in the first night. The food was great and better than I expected. The food I recommend is the lobster soup. It is the best one I tried ever. Though it is a little but expensive, I think the food quality and the staff service still worths it. We also tried breakfast, the set was tasty but just a little big in size, not sure if you could finish them all :DWe lived in Regal Villa 1. I don't think I need to describe in details because everything is just perfect. I did enjoy naked swimming many times inside the villa.I am highly appreciated with the service provided. I could always have shuttle pickup within 15 minutes since I called for it and when I get back to my room, the hotel staff has already prepared warm bath for me (the water temperature is just perfect).If you plan to live in Ubud, I suggest you might try Viceroy Bali."

","Honeymoon @ Viceroy Bali","We spent 3 nights and 4 days on a honeymoon package and had booked a Terrace Villa, (#2).In fact, we were trying to select between kamandalu and viceroy and what bowled me over were the prompt email responses by the staff.(Subrata and Eni) . Both were extremely courteous and detailed in the responses as I bugged them no end for months before hand. Once we reached the Denpasar airport, we were promptly attended to, as promised. The hotel was extremely beautiful. Unfortunately my wife fell ill on the very first day and we immediately got some tablets from the staff.The romantic dinner @Cascades was excellent as were the ala carte breakfast, though I believe the setting for the dinner could have been a bit more romantic with the use of some extra candles or such accessories.Also, the breakfast might benefit from a few more menu items. The spa @Lembah was also very good, however we wanted to have the spa upstairs but had to do it indoors,so make sure you book beforehand.The service was excellent, and so were the drivers. Margee took us to the temples and he was extremely courteous and knowledgable. We were really sad to leave.Definitely recommended!Some advice for ladies: Since the rice paddy fields are just adjoining , there's a healthy feed of lizards, spiders etc,especially if you keep the doors open, but no roaches thankfully. Even saw a small snake outside on the 4th day. The hotel does it best to keep them at bay, but sometimes, they can't be avoided, so be prepared."

","Ubud","Middle of the Jungle in Ubud with breathtaking views was a different experience and worth trying, We had a very nice stay and the staff were excellent trying to accommodate all our wishes, the food in cascade was one of the nice meals we had in Bali. The free wifi and complementary soft drinks mini bar was a nice touch, but overall this is more of a four star property.Beware you will encounter lots of insects being in the middle of the jungle so if you are not comfortable with this then Ubud is not the place for you."

","Magnificent resort and superb service. We loved the food!","We travel a lot. We eat a lot. When it comes to the world of hotels and restaurants, the devil is in the details. Without a doubt, the Viceroy Bali hits all the marks from the personalised (charming!) knowledgeable staff to the luxurious and comfortable stay in their beautiful resort located in, Ubud, one of the most unique destinations in South East Asia.We had a small group with us (six people) set to stay for four days. We had airport pickup - which was more like a guided tour from the driver who kindly greeted us with cool towels and refreshing drinks. The scenery for the hour or so long drive was amazing and lush lush lush! Rolling into Ubud, you could already feel the artisan and laid back vibe of the area as we passed one temple after the next. Pulling into the Viceroy, we first passed the local village which had gorgeous vistas of their rice fields. What an ideally located hotel! As well, we loved the helicopter pad (a respectable distance away from the main hotel). The entrance is much like the hotel, understated, elegant and Balinese. We were greeted with Leis (garlands) and check in was swift and we then were introduced to the small and intimate compound.It was wonderful to realise that we were standing in a valley, across from a working coconut plantation. The infinity pool was tempting and large with a nice family frolicking in the u-shaped pool. There were immediate plans hatched for us to jump in to drink at the water-side bar!Their destination restaurant, CasCades is inside a vast open-air ‘hut’ about three stories tall! Made from traditional means of tying together, what I assume is hay, the thatched roof is an awesome display of both modern as well as traditional craftsmanship.We jumped into our golf cart ‘buggies’ which take guests up and down the hill. During our stay, we mostly walked as the scenery of Balinese statues, mossed walls and marbled moldings – all framed by the lush green surroundings were beautiful.Being in the valley allows each villa to have 100% serene privacy as the hotel is built on a steep hill and the sightlines were carefully selected. We stayed in the Garden Villa which became the night time hang out because of the abundant outdoor space and great lighting of the private pool at night. We would play cards, have a dip in the pool while others read books on the day bed. Our kids would have loved this room as the layout was perfect for families.Others stayed in the beautiful and relaxing Terrace Villa which was more modern with an amazing exposed ‘hay thatched’ roof which gave an already large room, a luxurious and spacious homey feel. There was also a great breakfast nook area – right above the infinity pool over-looking the coconut plantation. As it had full sun first thing in the morning, breakfast in the pool (fresh Danish and Croissants from their talented pastry chef) became a tradition! We loved sitting on the long bench inside the pool slowly eating out breakfast and reading our papers.One couple who was with us owns a chain of restaurants back home and we made our way through the menu. Here is the list of ‘must’ trys!Fois Grois: Yummy and beautiful with a reduced fruit sauce on the side. Make sure to ask for the ‘sliced’ brown bread to accompany as this is freshly baked for you on request.Beetroot salad: Fresh and zingy sprinkled with moorish and amazing feta cheese and green leaves.Indonesian Chicken Soup: They make this spicy or not spicy and it was exactly what I wanted this one night. Light and flavourful with all the right amount of spices (not hot) to get your appetite going. What a joy!Lamb Rack: Wow and grilled to perfection. The reduced red wine sauce is devine, but they also offer a special mint sauce (not on the menu) which is lovely.Chicken: This was amusing as our friend wanted to order the ‘chicken dish’ as often in restaurants, no one ever orders it. It came out rolled, moist and perfectly browned. The next day, his wife ordered it again!Beef Randang: Amazing. Born in a ‘stew’ country, I thought I’ve had my share of good hearty beef stews! This has nothing on Bali, where most of the people are Hindu by religion. Soft and tender, the flavour profile of this dish was layered as only a South East Asian dish could be. I even asked for sambal (the local hot sauce) on the side which gave the dish a bit of kick.All in all, a wonderful vacation with old friends - the perfect place for us to relax. This magnificent hotel in paradise has set the bar for boutique 5-star hotels. Great location, lovely staff, wonderful food and great pools are just a few of the things we will miss. We are sure to return, either by ourselves or may be even with the kids in tow!"

","Relaxation at its best....","Today is April 11th and we are checking out of the Viceroy. Our stay here was a very good stay and we would come back. There are some pros and some cons on this property, more pros than cons......Pros, are that we got exactly what we where looking for in a relaxing property. We could not have ask for anything else out of a relaxing property, but to relax. We found that the room which we stayed, the Vice Regal #1 was the nicest room we have ever stayed in. From the monkeys in the yard to the villa pool outside the door we found this property was spectacular. I keep saying relax because that is all there really is to do. When we planned our vacation of 8 nights in Bali, we knew that we needed to take the first 4 days and unwind and that is what the Viceroy has done, exactly what we wanted. The food was good and the staff was pleasant, we had a great time here at the Viceroy.Cons...are the ride to get here! We tried to get the helicopter transfer as I knew it was an hour drive. I emailed every week to see if it was available before our arrival and it was not. So after the best immigration service every, as we never stopped moving though the airport we headed to the van that was waiting for a two hour drive which was not the best ride of my life. My wife and I both set in the back seats of the van and thought at some points our lives where in someone else's hands and that is not a good feeling. If I could suggest to take the helicopter if possible it would be worth it, I am sure as I did not get to take it. Also the shopping tour we took in the car was the same, so stay on the resort if you are looking to relax otherwise you will find yourself a little on the nerve side. Overall the resort itself was wonderful and the transfer to the resort was not, it is just the streets and the traffic. It is not there fault but being it is as far from the airport you must factor this in when making your decision.Thanks Viceroy for relaxing 4 days."

","Excellent Hotel","Stayed here for 6 days in a deluxe terrace villa. Overall we thought that the hotel was great, there was a few issues but they resolved them quickly...Let me get the small issues out of the way first. On our first day the hotel had a construction crew working on an expansion, this resulted in a lot of noise in our villa. We was concerned that the noise would be with us all week and complained to the front desk. As soon as they heard this the noise abated and we didn't hear anything for the rest of the week. One day the restaurant had an issue with breakfast that led to them misplacing our order. We sat for a hour without breakfast while everyone around us was being served, the server did tell us they made an error, apologized and breakfast came out quickly after that. We didn't have an issue with breakfast for the remaining days. We used the shuttle service to town one day and called for a pick up, the hotel told us to call to arrange pick up. When we did they said that it will be 5 minutes. We waited 15-20 minutes and called again, the front desk said that the driver was there looking for us. We waited another 15-20 minutes and finally saw our driver with a car full of people taking them to the town center, once he dropped them off and picked us up he told us that all of the cars were in use and he apologized. The waiting 40 minutes wasn't too bad but the front desk telling us the driver was looking for us kinda annoyed me. I could have easily just got a taxi back and saved us sitting on a corner in Ubud in the heat waiting on them if they just told us it would be a while.Now the positives...and there was lots of them! We got picked up at the airport and the ride was very easy and comfortable (took about 1 hour). Check-in was quick and simple and we got a nice refreshing drink. The walk to the villa is great with a beautiful view of the ravine overlooking the pool and restaurant. It really is a postcard view! The villa is well appointed, very clean, very quiet. The pool area is nice. You get sun consistently until about 1pm. If you want direct sun after that you will need to go to the main pool area. We ate at the restaurant one night (see separate review) and it was awesome. The breakfasts were good with the exception mentioned previously. The menu is pretty limited but it was always fine for us. We ate at the resort a couple of times for lunch and room service was good and the lunch menu was very good.We had a 2 hour spa experience which was really top notch. The spa is located in a great setting and we had a massage, flower petal bath, steam and hot tub. It rates up there with any spa experience we have had. We rented bikes one day and used the shuttle service another to visit the elephant safari. Both were easy to arrange. We also used the hotel to make all of our dinner reservations and the shuttle service for these was very easy.The service in general was great with all employees being so very friendly. Made you feel like home!Overall we would return and use the Viceroy again. They did a great job. Wish that trip advisor had a 1/2 star rating so I could give them 4.5 stars..."

","Magnificent!","The Viceroy Bali envelopes its' guests with warmth, luxury and comfort each moment of one's stay at this astoundingly beautiful resort. Upon arrival at the sweltering Bali airport, we were met by their driver, who immediately offered us chilled handtowels and bottled water (had we opted to arrive by helicopter, the Viceroy has a landing pad on sight). In fluent English, he provided us information about Ubud's history and Balinese culture. He could not have been more pleasant.The open-air lobby provided our first glimpse at the beauty and hospitality which awaited us. We were greeted with a refreshing glass of Balinese punch, and were promptly registered and driven by golf-cart to our gorgeous Vice Regal Villa 2. The Balinese stone sculpture and colorful flora en route was tasteful and perfectly maintained. After passing through a small private courtyard, we entered into our lovely Villa, which was extremely spacious and beautifully designed and appointed. Our private infinity plunge pool and lanai were pristine and provided an awesome view of a tropical gorge and swift stream. This was 'small luxury hotel' paradise!Upon further exploration, the grounds of the hotel proved magnificent; a stunning meandering infinity pool leads to their lovely (and delicious) open-air restaurant. The unbelievably beautiful spa overlooks the Ubud Valley with views of its' volcano...spectacular.The nicest part of our stay was that the quality of service matched the beauty of The Viceroy. The owners, Otto and Margaret, were lovely and attentive, as was each member of their staff. Every question or request was met with a smile and promptly answered. The complimentary car service into town was another of the services we greatly appreciated...and used frequently.All in all, The Viceroy provided us with an unforgettable memory of Bali. This heavenly spot reminds one of what a 5-star hotel should be, and we hope to again experience this bliss on our next visit to Bali."

","a little piece of paradise","Wonderful stay booked online for a week enjoying the beautiful Ubud.Location is just stunning on the Petula river gorge. A bit on the periphery of Ubud proper, but the hotel provides a free carservice to take you anywhere you want in the Ubud area. SO not a problem.Our room a deluxe terrace villa had unobscured views of the whole valley and the green green nature.The room it self is pure luxury - every detail is just perfect, including the private pool with a 'Bale' on top of it where on can sit in the shade and enjoy the views or indulge in some lovely high-tea delivered to your room. Service levels were generally extremely high. Everyone welcoming and no wish to difficult to deal with. Wonderful Spa, and very good restaurant (see separate review.)The perfect place for a Honeymoon or that special occation. Expensive - YES. Worth it : YES"

","Wonderful New Resort","We have chosen this hotel for us to rest in our around the world journey. Our decision couldn't have been wiser! The villas are very spaceous and we loved the fact that they had just been constructed and therefore the quality of every appliance and piece of furniture was intact. It's so nice to stay at a resort where things have not been worn down by use after use, for the past decade or so!!!The peacefulness of sorroundings is soo therapeutical!!! It's sooo beautiful!!!The staff is very polite and very helpful!! To give an example, I wanted a leaf of aloe vera to do a natural treatment for my hair, in the privacy of my villa, and since they didn't have the plant on the property, one of the gardeners went to procure it and bring it to me the second day!! That's what i call doing ur uttermost to satisfy your guests.Food is good even though the portions are a bit small for my taste and the dishes are on the expensive side given the cost of produce in Bali. Nonetheless, they are delicious."

","Peacefull luxury","My wife and i stayed in a terrace villa for 3 nights. The villas are as good as there is in Bali. We have stayed at the Banyan tree in Bali and i rate these villas against them. The pool may not be as big but the quality of the villas is as good. This is a boutique hotel and perfect for a short break for couples. As it is small it only has the one restaraunt which serves great food but i after a few days you are looking for something different. Not to take anything away from this place as it is the perfect place to start your holiday if you are looking for peace and quite while getting some of the best service in Bali. From the host to all the staff they make you feel like you are the only guests there. The hotel pool area is great if you want to leave your villa for a poolside drink but you may find sitting outside your villa in the serenity you may not want to move. The pick up service from the airport is also worth a mention as it made the start of the holiday even better. I would not recommend this hotel for anyone with kids but make it a must for couples. We will definitely return."

","The hotel to stay at when in Ubud","My husband and I just got back from Ubud for our honeymoon and stayed at the Viceroy after reading some reviews on Tripadvisor. This hotel definitely stands up to the reviews. It is to put it simply, just amazing.From check in to check out 9days later, we were treated like we were the only guest there. The staff are so attentive and friendly and always ready to assist. We stayed in the Deluxe terrace villa which was actually a bonus since we got upgraded to this room free of charge due to being on honeymoon. The room is incredible with amazing views and the most comfortable bed. Very spacious and with all the latest amenities, eg large screen tv, ipod docking station, espresso machine and the most important thing free wifi with really good connection and speed. The infinity private pool was bigger than I imagined. We are already talking about going back there, can't wait for our next vacation."

","great hotel in Bali","We have stayed at the hotel VICEROY last September.My wife did a lot of research before our trip, as we had never been to Bali before, and we stayed here on the strength of these reviews. We found the location excellent, there are plenty of shops around, and it is not far from the Monkey forest. It's a bit of a hike to the Markets, but as we enjoy walking this was not a problem for us. Taxis are plentiful and cheap in any case.The fitness Centre is little more than a bench and a few weights, but useful as the other Gyms in Ubud are far away. I would still recommend joining Ubud Fitness Centre though as I did ( 165000 rp for 7 days membership ) if you are looking for a Gym to stay fit in the area, and just catch a Taxi there as it's about 2km away.We always found the food excellent, and although we did not have dinner here, we had room service numerous times, and of course breakfast., we stayed in one of the deluxe room was excellent, with the Deluxe being excellent value for money. The rooms are very clean, and the whole Complex is beautifully Landscaped and excellently maintained.My only complaint was you could hear the distant traffic during the day, as it's not far from Monkey Forrest Rd and the other main road, but at night it's pretty quiet, maybe just the occasional Monkey fight from the Monkeys which wander in sometimes!All in all, a great place to stay if you are looking for reasonably priced accommodation, great friendly service in a well located spot."

","Great resort, superior service!","We have been to Bali several times, but this was our first stay at Ubud.This is a beautifully-locted resort, with green-hill views from our room. We got upgraded to the Viceroy Villa i/o the 2 Terrace Villas we had booked and this was a real treat. We were apprehensive at first as the Viceroy Villa was closest to nature - there was a sheer cliff where the villa wall (low) ended - but we ensured we never left the kids alone in that area and it turned out just fine. This is a great room, with a pool and 2 bedrooms. There was a lovely baby cot provided for the infant, i liked it so much that I wanted to bring it home! The service was great - except on the first day of Chinese New Year holiday, when they may have been understaffed. So breakfast took longer than usual - but that's about it.There was only one restaurant, but the continental fare was great, the Indonesian fare less so.The restaurant used to close at 11 pm, but they would keep the bar open and we had some pretty late nights there without a problem. There was also a babysitter service, which was helpful.Overall - a great stay with helpful staff and superb views."

","Heaven on earth!","The only problem with the Viceroy Bali is that the minute you arrive there you wonder how you are ever going to leave this little slice of heaven! I cannot fault the Viceroy even if I tried as every small detail was taken care of and nothing was too much trouble for the wonderful, friendly and attentive staff. The position of the hotel is breathtaking, overlooking a gorgeous gorge/jungle and waterfall with monkeys swinging in the trees - so peaceful and tranquil. Our private villa with swimming pool was magnificent, spacious and spotless. Owners/hosts Otto, Margaret and Anthony are always on hand for a chat and run this stunning hotel with precision and perfection. There is nothing lacking - the gym was great, the spa was wonderful and the restaurant was fantastic. Every meal was presented beautifully and the food was delicious. It was lovely that the chef Graham always came out of the kitchen to chat with the guests and any special meal request was taken care of without a problem. What a wonderful holiday - I'd go back in a heartbeat!"

","Fabulous retreat","If you need a private quiet place to retreat, then this is the one. I was there with mu husband about two years ago. The room was very luxurious. We had the pool terrace, it was beautiful. Up to now i am still amazed with their traditional roof made of leaves. I think it has a cooling effect and it is so thick that when the rain comes, it doesn't leak. Amazing! Anyway, i was taking a break from my hectic schedule and yes the resort does make me feel better.On the second day, i had a bad stomachache, they call a doctor straight away. It is part of their service in viceroy, free of charge too. Anyway, the doctor is very capable and professional. Being an indonesian myself, let's just say, i always do my medical in singapore. But this doctor, i have to say, he's not bad at all. Very impressive !! We had dinner in the restaurant and it was delicious. The surrounding is very quiet, the staff was very discreet but would remember your name. I would definitely come back for more..."

","FANTASTIC! Don't know why it's not rated higher.","My 2nd time staying here in a private villa with small infinity pool overlooking one of the best views anywhere. Breakfast is nice, main pool is great. You get privacy, luxury, and attentive service. Take advantage of the private car and have them take you out to some remote places on the island. You won't want to leave your villa it is so nice, but you can feel a bit like a bird in a guilded cage as you are outside of Ubud itself. If you feel that Ubud is too commercialized and you are searching for that special feeling of discovery, take an early morning walk up the dirt road from the hotel and find yourself in the middle of rice paddies and small village life - priceless."

","Absolute perfection in Ubud","Having read reviews on Trip Advisor, we booked the Viceroy as the reviews read very well. You always wonder if someone else's 'excellent' will be your idea of excellent too. We were not disappointed at all. The Viceroy is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in and we've stayed in some of the best (The Ritz Piccadilly, The Waldorf Astoria, The Regent in Chang Mai to name but a few to give you the idea). The Viceroy left them all standing!The villa was divine, the facilities absolutely superb, the views breathtaking and the food really was exquisite (even the room service - something that most hotels struggle to get right). The spa treatments were amazing - after a couple of hours in Lembah Spa I was so incredibly relaxed, the ladies were ever so attentive and very keen to give you the very best experience possible. You might have thought that a hotel of this standard might not be accommodating to children (ours are aged 10 and 4) but this was not the case, the staff were all incredibly friendly and went out of their way to make all of us welcome.Our youngest daughter fell and cut her hand (her fault entirely) and the staff couldn't do enough to help, one of the owners drove us to the nearby hospital clinic himself. The next day when we needed a fresh bandage, someone was sent out for a new pack within half an hour (at no charge, what a lovely gesture).Attention to detail was everywhere, from pretty flowers decorating every available place to the cleanliness and tidyness of every aspect of the property which was superbly appointed with beautiful furniture and finishings at every turn. The cocktail menu was as long as any I've seen and the few I tried were incredible (Bali Moon was my favourite). Sitting at the swim up bar with the view across the Petanu valley as the sun was going down was fabulous. When asked for any feedback at the end of our stay I had to confess that the only thing I could think of (after a long hard think) was the little vases that held the flowers on each table in the restaurant could have been a little prettier! I would bet by now that this has been done. I cannot wait to go back!"

","Amazing!","We purchased a five night stay via an auction website (Luxury Link.com). It was probably the best purchasing decision we have made via a site of that nature. The hotel is just amazing. It is set atop and into a hill in the Valley of Kings, so one looks down upon a river gorge and lush vegetation. We ""won"" a garden suite but on the advice of other Trip Advisors I contacted the hotel in advance and booked a Terrace Villa. The room was large and lovely, with a private infinity pool and a private lanai and patio. Essentially you step through a set of teak doors, and then down a few steps into your own private property. The room was gorgeously decorated, the amenities lovely and as others have noted all the non-alcoholic items in the mini-bar were free. The very comfortable bed was a kingsize set in the middle of the room with a bathroom that was huge (it ran the entire width of our villa) and unbelievably beautiful. The room service menu was limited but the food was very good. Breakfast was included in our package (I think it is standard) and was comprised of fresh fruit, fresh fruit juice, and one of any other item (eggs benedict, french toast, homemade yogurt etc). Coffee was either french press or cafe au lait, etc. The hotel has a beautiful infinity pool if you wish to wander up to the main grounds, we also spent alot of time there. I can tell you that the pictures are exactly as what you will find when you arrive. The Spa on the premises is also top notch. This hotel exudes serenity, peacefulness and it is clear that it is a passion of sorts for the owners. Everything is meticulously maintained and well thought out in impeccable detail. The staff are warm, welcoming and helpful. The hotel transfers from the airports were very good with large and comfortable SUV's. This is a definite 5 star experience for someone who wishes to enjoy amazing luxury and care and be away from the hustle and bustle of Ubud proper or the beaches at Kuta etc."

","Paradis in the valley","My boyfriend and I spent the first night in Nusa Dua and we got Viceroy to arrange to pick us up from Nusa Dua to Viceroy in Ubud. The journey took 2 hours and I'm gladded we are sitting in the comfortable Viceroy’s Toyota Innova instead of some old taxi. We were greeted by the friendly front desk team and finally met Jero, the friendly front desk whom I had been communicating with thru email all this while to arrange the stay in Viceroy. The check in was so smooth that we had confirmed our candle light dinner to spa appointment in less than 15 min at the hotel lobby. We went WOW the moment we stepped into our villa, the view outside is simply amazing! The room is stunning and luxurious, with the Viceroy “V” logo deco everywhere, felt like royalty living in the middle of the valley! The room is clean and spotless, I have to say there are not many hotel room I'm willing go barefooted in but definitely I had no issue with my villa. Love the small personal touch in the room, the welcome letter from Margaret and the flowers on bed is lovely (it still smell fresh till the day we left!), the daily fruit platter and I have to complement it’s very thoughtful to place bottle water at each side of the bed, easy to reach for in the middle of the night. Breakfast at CasCades are delicious, all dishes looks so appetizing! Maybe we have gotten used to the breakfast buffet at other hotels, it will be even better if the size of breakfast can be a little bigger. But with the stunning valley view and the amazing service by the staffs, this got to be one of the most enjoyable breakfasts we had ever had. We have our dinner (comes with the package) in CasCades as well… every dish the service crew brought to us is a pleasant surprise. We can feel the passion in the food and the whole dining experience provided by the CasCades team is just memorable.Spa in Lembah Spa is a must do in Viceroy, this is the best spa I had in Bali. For the past few years I had gotten so used to massaging that a light soft touch will not do anything to relief the ache on my shoulder but Suri, my therapist done a fantastic job with her strong deep tissue massage, I almost fell asleep in the spa session. To end the spa session with the breathtaking over view in a hot Jacuzzi is just simply blissful.Going around Ubud area is never a issue when staying in Viceroy when shuttle on-demand is always available, the staff is more than happy to take us out to the other ubud area whenever we wanted to and will pick us up with just a phone call away. This is such a bonus service to make travelling easy and enjoyable. In all, we are happy to chosen Viceroy over all the other hotels. I can still vividly remembered the happy smile on my boyfriend’s face from the moment we stepped into the villa, he totally love the place! It’s not that expensive considering the package we were offered and the excellent hospitality by the hotel staff. Viceroy deliver more than what they promised, not only the room look just exactly like the photos in the website but even better, the staff were always helpful, smiling and willing to make our stay as good as possible. Thanks to Jero for making all the necessary arrangement from room to spa, Gama for fetching us from and to airport safely, it’s so comfortable in the car that we didn’t even feel the earthquake at all and the young gentleman (sorry didn’t manage to get your name) who help us to rearrange our spa appointment and told us about the famous Babi Guling, it was nice chatting with you and all the Viceroy staffs who made our stay in Viceroy so memorable. I’ll be back for sure!On a side note, Viceroy has the fluffiest towel I had ever hug, feel so pampered whenever using it!"

","A perfect and serene property in Ubud among ricefields","We had a great stay at the Viceroy last June and I was very happy of choosing this property. It is located outside the busy City centre of Ubud and the free shuttle is running upon request to drop you off or pick you up anywhere in Ubud. We chose a Terrace Villa and we do not regret our choice. They offer great views over the valley since they are located on the upper part of the property. The service was excellent from the time we arrived until our departure. We took the Visa Facilitator Service for our arrival at the airport which expedited the process in a few seconds. We found it good although there was not much crowd at the airport at that time. The property is very well maintained and the furniture and equipment are in excellent conditions. The views over the valley from the restaurant are breathtaking. The breakfasts were amazing and there is a good variety of food, always fresh. We took a package including a Gastronomic Supper at Cascades restaurant plus a spa session and return airport transfers. We were able to get our supper in-villa which was an unforgetable experience. The food was excellent and grand cuisine level. The surroundings of the property offer plenty of possibilities for walks among rice fields. The Viceroy remains a boutique hotel and we felt treated as valuable guests. According to us, the prices for food and beverages were reasonnable that's why we took most of our meals at the hotel. I would recommend the Viceroy Ubud for any stay in Ubud region and I would make it a perfect reference."

","Despite Some Issues, Still 5 Star Luxury","After a 14 hour flight from San Francisco to Hong Kong and a 4 1/2 flight to Denpasar, we were exhausted. We opted for the police escort from the airport to the hotel (arranged for by the hotel @ $175 US) and it was worth every cent. Denpasar at rush hour is the worst. With the escort with lights and siren, we saved at least an hour of agonizing delay.The hotel was everything that we expected visually but the delightful surprise was the staff. In all of our travels we have never been treated so well. From the check in to the cleaning and dining room staff and to the shuttle drivers, everyone was gracious without being obsequious.  We were staying for 11 days in a Deluxe Terrace Villa. Initially we were given number 17. It was beautiful, as are all the villas. After about a week, the air conditioning started acting up. We like the room cool, especially while sleeping, and noticed it had stopped cooling in the middle of the night. We mentioned to the front desk as we were going out for the day and on our return, we were told it was 'fixed'. Except it wasn't. That night it failed again. The next morning, same routine. Received heartfelt apologies and assurances it would be repaired. Upon returning to the villa it was apparent that the A/C was still non-functioning. My displeasure was obvious and made known. We were then moved to Villa 21. The new villa was a marked improvement from 17. Better view (much better), with a prettier blue tiled pool. Had i known of the differences among Deluxe Terrace Villas I would have requested to see all available villas at check in. For our inconvenience we were given a free one hour spa. Nice.The convenience of the shuttle on demand cannot be overstated. Other hotels we had considered had shuttles but only at set hours. The Viceroy would take you where you wanted to go and when. They would pick you up within 15 minutes of your phone call. The drivers were delightful.Another big plus is the size and layout of the hotel. Even though it was about 80% full throughout our stay, we had almost no sense of other guests present. A few here and there, but everyone must have been on different schedules because at breakfast or dinner at the Cascades, only a few other guests were ever apparent. We enjoyed several dinners at the restaurant and breakfast almost daily. The a la carte menu offers a great selection and they will gladly augment your choice with no-charge ad ons. Two coffees are offered. Balinese, which is mild and a much stronger, French roast. After a couple of days we simply requested a pot of each and blended them in our coffee cup. Just right!Room service. How many hotels are left that still offer a full menu room service 24 hours a day? The Viceroy does and it works. One night my wife was not feeling well so we stayed in. We had a light meal in the room. At 3:00 a.m. my wife was complaining of an upset stomach and wanted yogurt, tomato soup and bread. I called room serve and within 20 minutes everything she requested was delivered including hot, fresh rolls.Despite the glitch with the air conditioning and the inconvenience of having to change rooms, our 11 days at the Viceroy were blissfully wonderful. We look forward to our return."

","Absolutely Stunning Location, Luxurious Rooms, Superb Service and Delicious Restaurant","Have you ever dreamed about visiting a boutique hotel where you will be in a permanent state of supreme happiness during your entire visit? Where your entire experience will be so blissful that you secretly wish to stay forever in that place? Where the entire team of hotel's staff members want to ensure that your stay is the most memorable experience...ever? Well, Viceroy Bali is exactly this type of hotel where you will discover what a true 5 star luxury experience is all about. I have recently stayed there together with my husband for 3 nights to celebrate my husband's birthday. We have stayed in total of 6 different hotels during our 16 day trip with the goal to experience different locations and various resorts. Viceroy Bali was something completely extraordinary and the best hotel not only out of all the places we visited in Bali but probably out of many places we visited around the world. Simply wow from the very first moment until the very last. I was choosing among several different hotels around Ubud area and directly contacted each property to find out additional information and ensure that everything would be perfect. You know when you travel around the globe to come to a foreign country to celebrate a birthday, you want to make sure everything is perfect without any bad surprises, disappointments and mishaps. So, Viceroy Bali was already on top of my choice list of hotels before I even considered making a booking simply because I loved the fact that their website provided so much useful information about the resort. I felt they don't have anything to hide or mislead you about...tons of photos and videos about villas in every category along with detailed description of what to expect. Once we arrived to our villa (we stayed in Terrace Villa) everything inside and outside the Villa looked exactly like what you see on their website. (not like seeing a pretty picture on the website and paying tons of money only to find out that your room looks nothing like what was pictured on the website because apparently that was a picture of presidential penthouse.) Nila and Ika promptly answered all my emails (many of them!) and helped me plan a great trip to their resort. (just a side fact: it took 4 days for Ubud Hanging Gardens to return my first email (Viceroy staff already answered about 10 emails from me in that time frame. The Chedi Club would not send any photos of their villas, but encouraged me to trust them that I would not be disappointed (I didn't trust them), and Komaneka would reply to all my emails with general ""we are so wonderful"" without reading my emails and answering specific questions that I asked.) So Viceroy it was thanks to impeccable, friendly and timely responses from Nila and Ika. Our Villa was absolutely stunning and I was beyond happy when I walked through the front door and saw a gorgeous Balinese pavilion perched above sparkling clean pool with absolutely AMAZING views of the valley. Words cannot begin to describe this million dollar view that you can enjoy day and night from the privacy of your villa or your Bale or your pool. Absolutely blissful and peaceful! Everything inside the Villa is so luxurious that you feel like royalty. And when I say everything, I truly mean it! There has been so much attention given to designing and decorating the Villa that it always feels like the owners have thought about everything you might possibly need for your 5 star ultra luxury experience. (the resort is run by a family who lives on the property and takes time to meet with all guests to make sure they are on heaven.)Cascades restaurant was the only restaurant on the property but even if they had 10 other restaurants you would want to eat at Cascades everyday all day. Because it is so delicious! Everything you order (we had breakfasts, lunches and dinners over there) tastes amazing and presented so skillfully that you look at your dish as some sort of artistic creation of deliciousness! Of course we were intrigued and met the chef one day, who took time to share with us his unbelievable passion for food and cooking, no wonder Cascades is so yummy! We saw guests from all over the island drive all the way to Cascades just to taste it. And then they contemplated how to do some more activities in the area the next day so that they can return to Cascades again. We also tried massage twice, once in the spa and once in the privacy of our Villa. Even though Spa has unbelievable views and all that, I preferred the massage in our Villa because it was done outside on the patio of our Villa, with fresh breeze from the valley, singing birds and trickling fountain from our private pool. I felt much more relaxed than being inside the room at the spa. Both times my husband and I had amazing massage therapists and massage was divine! A real massage, not just rubbing oil all over your body for an hour type of massage. This hotel is also located just a short 5 minute walk from a local village, so one day we ventured into the village and happened to come during a local ceremony celebration where we were the only tourists yet we felt so welcomed! We met many people in that village who work at Viceroy, all of them introduced us to their families, explained us what is going on, traditions, culture, etc so we felt the entire spontaneous outing to the local village was a special treat. Definitely visit it during your stay, it is literally only 5 minutes walk through beautiful rice fields. So, in my opinion, Viceroy delivers what it promises - a luxurious, comfortable experience that would make you want to come back and also tell all your friends about it. From the moment you arrive, you would feel like everyone who works there is part of your family. The entire staff is so friendly, attentive and caring; sincerely eager to help you, answer any questions and share insight into their culture and traditions if you are interested to learn. The stay at Viceroy was truly memorable and I would go back to Viceroy in a heartbeat!!!"

Stayed there 5 days and was very sad to leave. The staff is wonderful and very kind! Great service! The restaurant is very beautiful but the food could use some improvement. Also missed Indonisian food on the menu."

","Tranquility lounge","The hotel is located in a far flung area of Ubud which sounds very mystical and the Location certainly is different from seminiyak. I loved the hotel and the family which runs the hotel.it is built in a sort of a mountain resort with the entire hotel overlooking a valley which is very picturesque.The rooms are large and open baths and outdoor dip ponds and wooden cabanas to lounge in. I love the espresso makers in the room!!! Thank you.The food was fresh and filled with aroma of fresh herbs and vegetables!!!the air was clean and made u very hungry.... I'm certainly going back"

Much has been said in previous reviews so I won't repeat them here but the stand out features are: lovely private pool (we stayed in deluxe terrace), beautiful view, quiet, coffee machine, nice beds, perfect outdoor massage, awesome showers, excellent service. We had a beautiful meal for our wedding anniversary in the cascades restaurant. Loved our time here."

","The Viceroy is in a class of its own","We loved our stay at the Viceroy. It has breathtaking views, an intimate scale and amazing attention to detail. The room was lovely with outdoor spa, massive bathroom and immaculately presented (with the added bonus of a coffee machine, DVDs and complimentary soft drinks). The Cascades restaurant is excellent and the staff are all lovely. The spa is beautifully appointed and provided the best massage of my time in Bali - highly recommended. It was also a real luxury that hotel drivers are available to take guests into Ubud and collect them when required, they all spoke great english were all very happy to talk about local culture and answer any questions which enriched the experience. The owners of the hotel were visible and friendly and Jonathon, the hotel's English Manager, went out of his way to be helpful. This included recommending two Sobek tours which were a real success - white water rafting and a wonderful bike ride. We also got great help when requiring medical treatment after a monkey bite at the Monkey Forest. Whilst the hotel probably appeals more to couples than families, our son was made to feel extremely welcome, loved all the facilities and a highlight was a kite making session arranged by the hotel. We all hope to return to the hotel on our next trip."

","Stunning resort, best coffee in Bali, awesome DVD collection","This place is stunning, I stayed three nights and was so impressed! Each villa has access to very fast, free WiFi, and I loved the DVD library. It's almost a private branch of Blockbusters in the conference room below reception. You can choose from literally hundreds of movies, and a decent number of books too. Soft drinks are all free from the minibar here. This isn't something I've experienced anywhere else, and neither is the drinkable tap water, both huge plus points in Bali. They filter their own water around the resort! The hotel operates a shuttle bus as and when you need it, and the drivers will drop you and pick you up wherever you like in the Ubud area. The local village however, just five minutes down the road offers a fantastic taste of the local culture and I found the shopping much cheaper on this street than in town. Don't miss the dream-catcher shop!The special CasCades Omelette featuring shallots, ham, runny camembert and cranberry sauce is one of the nicest (and tastiest) egg dishes I think I've ever had. Can't wait to go back to The Viceroy!

","Delightful setting, style and service","My just teenage daughter and I along with good family friends stayed here for four days in February. On arrival, we were warmly greeted by the manager and later the owner. They went out of their way and to great pains to get our villa next to our friends. The villas were pristine, classy and comfortable and the setting serene, with the soothing sounds of the river down in the ravine and views of the hillside across with lush foliage and abundance of birds and other. The kids loved the pools, the room service meals and the dance lessons at the villas. If they had it their way, they would never have left the property! Breakfasts at the restaurant were included and were healthy, fresh and sustaining and the views and open air setting a nice start to the day. Everything here was superb and it was a great retreat after the hustle and bustle of Ubud and it's surrounds."

","Very nice, but ...","After reading a lot of reviews on trip advisor and other pages, we finally decided to book our stay here. The customer service / phone booking already was very, very well done - mostly thanks to the great explanations of the British chap on the phone, whose name I forgot (unfortunately).we've spent a long weekend here and we have to say, that we have a rather mixed review of the place. Whereas, the hotel and it's rooms are superb and very modern / luxurious - other things were rather bothersome. Especially the construction around it - which will surely not be finished anytime soon, given that we could see villas being completely rebuilt, from ground up - I can only assume, but I would not expect this to finish anytime soon (as stated in other reviews before). the constant smell of paint and the sound of hammering, disturbed the quiet and relaxing atmosphere. The weather right now is beautiful - not too hot and not cold, guessing around 24 degrees. We are from Singapore, so we enjoyed the welcome break from a constant 30 degrees, but this had a very unfortunate side effect. The pool in the villa as well as the main pool is not heated, so it was literally unusable. The water was freezing cold which makes the pool villa rather useless ;) ...In any way, we enjoyed our stay, because the food, service, staff and rooms were amazing, but if I would recommend the hotel, is a tricky question. Probably yes, but surely not while the construction is ongoing and the weather is on the cold side, especially given that the hotel is rather expensive and therefore our expectations were - i guess rather high. Arguably, the weather is nothing the hotel can influence, but I still think that (at least) the main pool could have used a water heater."

","Fabulous if not for chain-saw guy!","We stayed for 5 nights and wanted peace and quiet. Unfortunately, a guy using his incredibly noisy chain-saw in the adjoining forest ruined the entire stay. Margaret, the owner, said he does this regularly each few months to thin the forest and reduce the monkey population and it was ""too bad"" we copped him. Also ""too bad"" for us was that Margaret held a private function in her restaurant and we had to walk up to order room service because staff for house guests that evening was sparse.Between chain-saw guy and the building of a few more villas, we found ourselves trying to escape from our villa during the day. The meals at Cascade restaurant are fabulous. The villa was wonderfully appointed, apart from the pool being in shade all day and a tad cold for us to use."

","The rest of the world is not as wonderful...","What a wonderful place the Viceroy is. From the kind and helpful staff to the beautiful Indonesian styled super clean and modern rooms to the food that ended up after one week of trying all else in Ubud village to be the best around. The Viceroy is a once in a lifetime experience.The owners are fabulous and personally get to know you as the place is only 20 villas situated in a small and elegant stone village. It almost has an Indonesian/Italian vibe.Our room also had our very own infinity pool, with a waterfall and a stone mermaid. Do I need to say anything else. The showers, toilet and TV were all modern but everything had an Indonesian flair to it.And the food... after trying a different place everyday in Ubud but having a lunch or a dinner at the hotel we realized the best food was at the Viceroy. Really must thank the Chef and the cooks for some amazing meals. Their ribs and club sandwich are A-mazing! We had room service and ate by our pool in our room a few nights! Hard to go back to reality after that..."

","Great service ..","We stayed 4 nights at the Viceroy Hotel. It’s a small property with few villas and each villa has its own swimming pool and nice view of the valley. The hotel is a great choice for people who look for a romantic and relaxing holiday away from the noise, crowd and city centre. It has all the needed facilities, a restaurant, gymnasium, a nice swimming pool, a spa and a small shop. A shuttle service is also provided to the town of Ubud.The staff were amazing, always with a smile, so helpful and speaks perfect English. Spacious villas, the bathroom was amazing, it gives you the feeling as if you are taking a shower in an open area (garden). Even the extra bed we requested for was very comfortable, not like the usual small ones we usually get in hotels. All amenities are provided in the villa and you even have your own small coffee machine.You can have your a la carte breakfast either at the hotel restaurant or even in your villa with good options to choose from. Since the hotel is located in the valley, you might find some little insects sometimes which is something usual for such a location, but yet the hotel is very clean."

","Heaven on earth","Title says it all.I converted my husband from being a Bali sceptic to a convert after only two nights at this incredible hote.We caught a taxi from Ubud for the 15 minute drive east to the remote, security protected hotel.While our allocated buggy driver loaded our luggage as we checked-in, sipping a welcome mocktail and were told our Terrace Villa with private infinity pool had been upgraded to one of only three Viceroy Villas (even though I'd jagged a major bargain online), we took in the luxury and absolute privelage that lay before us.While some could stanch the gushing nose bleed brought on by Viceroy's prices, it's worth the left kidney and mother-in-law's retinas to experience this once in a lifetime, priceless accomodation experience. Just once. And even if it's only for one night.I wish I had taken more photos but I was far too busy makeing the absolute most of our state-of-the-art electronics, bathroom you could get lost in (though I did only take the toothbrushes), and private plunge pool which we cooled down in while watching monkeys swing from tree to tree in the forrest before us.Cascades is well known in Ubud because the eight-course degustation, which can be delivered to your room, and cocktails overlooking a jungle sunset are worth knowing about. And I am massively dissapointed my plans to abduct the pastry chef were foiled because I would happily clot every artery, vein and capillary in my body for a daily encounter of the hotel's exquisite, flakey, buttery and light as air sweet and savoury breakfast pastry fare. Their Indonesian offerings are not bad either (though I find the five-star places don't hold a candle to the street-side warungs).The thing I love the most about the Viceroy was it's boutique quality that made you feel at home...not that my home is within cooey of this luxury...but compared to other five-star hotels in the Ubud area, the Viceroy manages the indulegence without the feeling that your obviously being indulged and paying for it.There are a lot of gorgeous, quality and heavenly hotels in Ubud. I hope I get to try them all!! But the Viceroy is just a bit in a league of it's own. For that price, I would chose it over any of the others."

","The most perfect, beautiful hotel I have ever stayed in. The staff do everything they can to make your stay wonderful.","From the moment we arrived The Viceroy everything was perfect. It is about 6yrs old, and designed to perfection. We were going to stay at the 4 seasons but friends highly recommended we choose the Viceroy as its smaller and more personal, they were so right. We were ushered through Bali airport, visas processed in moments and then driven about an hour to Ubud. All the staff speak perfect English, know your names, and are very proactive in assisting with anything you ask. The hotels car is ready to take you into Ubud (5 mins away) and pick you up whenever you request it by phone. I had hurt my ankle and so the staff drove me in a golf buggy all around the hotel grounds and up and down to reception and the restaurant all week. There is nothing that could not be arranged, swiftly and efficiently. The infinity pool was medium size but in a horseshoe shape so easy for swimming longer lengths and we were the only people in it. We were upgraded to the best suite in the hotel, and had our own private garden and pool to enjoy. The room itself was huge, bfully furnished and the bathroom was a dream come true. I felt like a Princess the whole time I was there. The restaurant over looking the valley and the pool served a wonderful varied breakfast from a menu, rather than a buffet - which I prefer. We had a candlelit dinner which was outstanding and very romantic with a heart of petals arranged around our table and thoughtful non interruptive service.The spa and treatments are lovely and very restful and unhurried.We rented the hotel bikes and had fun around Ubud all day and were told if we got tired, or my ankle hurt, the truck would collect the bikes and we would be brought home. Adventure trips were easily arranged: volcano hiking at sunrise; white water rafting; down hill cycling. It was the perfect hotel in a perfect location. The views of the valley to the river are gorgeous. Although we were not traveling with children, families were made very welcome. There is nothing I could say that could improve my experience of staying there except that I wanted to stay longer."

","absolute paradise !","We stayed here for 3 nights back in August 2010 ( a bit late with the review I know but am planning a return visit so turned my attention back to it) ) .i My husband and I have been to Bali many times ( 8) with our children and always stay at the Intercontinental in Jimbaran ( which is also great but not in the same league as the Viceroy). This time we were traveling without kids so decided to spoil ourselves a little more .From the moment we were met inside the customs area at the airport we knew this stay would be different. After a very quick immigration clearance ( Viceroy arrange this for you) we were met by our driver. He was a very pleasant guy with a killer smile who gave us lots of helpful information. Upon arrival at the hotel we were met by equally pleasant, smiling , reception staff, given a Bali welcome , and then shown to our villa. What can I say - it was the most amazing room i have ever stayed in and I have stayed in a lot of hotels over the years. The rooms actually look like the photos on the web site. The hotel staff were all lovely and eager to please. The restaurant was great , service was excellent ( Bali style - ie its important to remember you are on holidays and things slow down a bit. ) . This is a great place for a romantic get away - we were treated as though we were on our honeymoon which was a real treat as we are approaching 25 years marriage. i cannot say enough -- this place is heaven and i can't wait to go back."

","Pampered in Luxury","We stayed at the Viceroy for 11 days, and enjoyed a special package rate offered to us for the two bedrooms Viceroy Villa. We were not disappointed.The Viceroy Villa itself comprises a substantial self-contained area. The bedrooms are large and comfortable, the bathrooms luxurious. Our infinity pool is fairly large (for a hotel private pool) and deep enough to swim short lengths. The communal living area between the bedrooms opens on to the pool, where there is a dining area, sitting area and tea/coffee facilities. There is also a pavilion to relax in at one end of the villa’s perfectly maintained garden.Every morning, a staff of 4 to 5 would spend about 1.5 hours together immaculately servicing every part of the compound, including the garden and pool.‘Five star luxury’ could be fairly applied to all the amenities of the hotel, with a price to match. The food in the ‘Cascades’ restaurant was of a Michelin starred standard, although room service meals tended to arrive cold. The Spa, the main infinity pool and library also impressed.The service levels were exceptionally high, particularly the team in the restaurant – many greeting you by name even on the first day. The drivers were also extremely helpful. We got the impression that the owner employed a ‘stick & carrot’ approach to his staff. We witnessed him snap at one for responding too slowly. However to be fair, we were told that as much as 7% of the 10% service charge was generously distributed amongst them. Apparently, staff stayed for an average of over 2 years, so the owner’s slightly strict but rewarding regime seemed to work well. Jero, at the front desk, was particularly helpful, having been with the hotel since its inception. Ironically though, it wasn’t until our 5th day that the owner, Otto, introduced himself!Negatives – hardly any. To maintain the authenticity of the buildings, they were not very soundproof, so conversations from other villas could be heard. The free shuttle transport (provided ‘on demand’) was very good – the drivers always anxious to please, although sometimes a little erratic (we waited between 5 and 25 minutes for a car into town).Without doubt, the Viceroy is a princely establishment for those who wish to be really pampered."

","Best hotel in Bali!","We drove in from Seminyak after 3 days on the beach. The staff gave us a warm welcome and took us to the villa. It was grand and the pool was awesome! The views were amazing but peaceful and serene. We felt immediately this was paradise.The spa is located at the top of the property and has spectacular views and a terrific jacuzzi and steam room not to mention a great staff. Our couples massage included a flower petal bath that was beautifully decorated with frangipanis, roses and local flowers. We left the kids in the room for a romantic candlelight dinner at the restaurant. We were served a 5 course meal and we were surprised at the sophistication of the dishes. Our kids had great room service. The hotel also brought in balinese dance instructors who gave the kids a private lesson - really authentic experience.Ubud is very close and the hotel's free shuttle takes you in and picks you up as well until 11 pm. The staff also organized tours and took great care of us. The owner lives on the property and is there all the time. The hotel is grand and yet has only 15 villas. I wish we could find such a place in other countries as we travel 5 or 6 times a year on vacation.we usually never go back to a destination because we have so many more places to go but we actually considered coming back to the Viceroy next year.So if you ever go to Bali just book yourself at the Viceroy! You will be happy in paradise!!"

","taste of paradise","My wife and I highly recommend the viceroy. It is the ultimate place for rest and relaxation. I recommend staying in the Deluxe Terrace Villas once the construction is over as they are amazing. We were transferred to the Vice Regal villa due to the construction. The Vice Regal villa was not as modern but had a larger outdoor area with a garden. The food was great. I definitely recommend the chocolate dessert. We had it everyday. The service was phenomenal. They responded to our construction complaint very promptly. Although they could not get us an equivalent room, they upgraded our room to a larger room. The drivers were great and very knowledgeable about the area. We didnt have to worry about cabs as the hotel's car service dropped us off and picked us up when we needed them."

","OMG - There is a heaven on earth & It is called the ""Viceroy Bali""","We stayed here last week for our honey moon and I have to tell you that this hotel is like heaven on earth. Having stayed in a lot of 5 star accommodation in different parts of the world, this would definately rate as one of the best.The staff knew us by name, and were always friendly and no request was ever too hard. It is a credit to the hotel to have such lovely friendly staff.The views were breath taking and you always felt like you had total privacy at all times.The rooms were immaculate and were cleaned and restocked on a daily basis.The resteraunt. OMG where do you start. The food was some of the best food I think that I have ever eaten. The degustation menu is definately worth trying and the service is immaculate. I have read a few comments about the price of the food, but I believe that you get what you pay for.The only one dissapointment we had with the Viceroy is that we had to leave.Definately worth coming and staying. You will not be disappointed!!!"

","The heaven of relaxation and calm in a place surrounded by beautiful nature.","My stay at Viceroy in Ubud Bali was the the thing I was expecting! As a boutique hotel must , Viceroy gave me a chance to live in a nice villa which provided calm and relaxation wih the small pool and terrace. The quality of service and state of the facilities are superb. I enjoyed both my privace and a wonderful communication with the owners, a very distinguished family. It was both respectful and friendly at the same time. The service is very effective and polite. The villas are great. The hotel has its own shuttle which can take you to Ubud for shopping or to a restaurant, making it very simple to reacht the city. I was taken to the local market - and it was a great trip where my driver helped me as an enterpereter and showed me around. I was happy to tip for this!As a person who wanted asian food in Asia was slightly disappointed during breakfast or at the restaurant because it was more of a european cuisine. I would prefer it to be more authentically asian. I personally prefer buffet for breakfast which is not available at Viceroy, but this is my personal food habit. Other than that everything was perfect.In a word - it is great place for a love couple who want to stay far from parties and crowd."

","Modern boutique villas with great shuttle service, great service though inconsistent...","This is my 2nd time staying in Ubud. Viceroy had made my 6 trip pleasant. Let me share with u the pros and Cons.(I am checking out in a couple of hours, still in my comfy bed in viceroy)Pros-1. When I emailed them directly, they were very quick to respond... In fact they immediaty offer me a package that included a dinner for 2 ,a 2hr Spa Package for 2, small bottle of Moet, and VIP immigration services and airport transfers. The offer was quite irresistible, so I book the new Delux Terrace Villa.2. At the airport, our names we held at the end of the airbridge before immigration, our passports were stamp bypassing all queues that's great, except that we were greeted by only one officer but he had to attend to another family as well, so even though we pass the queue and collected our luggages, we had to wait around for 10mins or so to clear customs with the family which was really unfair as the officer paid full attention to them while we were neglected, we even had to look for him. Viceroy driver came promptly later and pick us up gave us cold towels and water which was great, we even manage to stop at Ibu Oka 2 on our way to the hotel, excellent!2. When we check in we realize we r upgraded to Vice Regal villa, one tier above what we paid for. The room was in good condition, some tired furniture, but overall in ok condition. 3. The Spa is Excellent... We had 2 massages there and they were great but the spa was a little noisy u could hear people talk n walking around, so I strongly recommend that u request it to be done in yr villa.4. Somedays they service was good. Somedays average. Really depends who's on shift to pick up yr call. Sometimes I have to keep reminding them to bring in more bottles water as I need it for my medication... Somedays they need to be reminded. 5. The restaurant staff was fabulous and the food's Excellent! All of them were really attentive n well trained, they even prepared us a special local menu on our last night cos we were to lazy to move.Now the Cons1. I have ranidaphobia(frog phobia), there are like 3 resident frogs here , so I didn't dare swim during the night, they only come out in the night.... And many colourful mid size iguanas as well... The landscaping outside is just very dated with random pots n ferns and an old tree... There's also not much of a view here compares to Kupu Kupu Barong and four seasons which was about the same rate.2. I already mentioned about the inconsistent service here... Only the restaurant didn't let me down.3. I will recommend this hotel if u are not into great views cos the rooms r definitely more modern... Really wish the staff would have done something about the frogs but they just say they will not harm me and I really had a hard time time explaining to them about my phobia so I just didn't go out of my roomduring the night after 2 nights of explanation."

","Do yourself a favor and wait until construction is completed to stay at this boutique hotel","My wife and I had one of the more personal and romantic stays at this hotel over New Years. The spa is very well done and not to be missed. The food at Cascades is good for dinner, not great, but the inclusive breakfast (get the benedict) with fresh squeezed juices and local coffee is outstanding. We did have one hang up, which was actually mentioned in a separate review, and that was the construction of two new villas on the property. Management responded stating that it was to be completed end of summer but this was simply not the case. We really enjoyed our stay and loved the two owners, who are actually onsite checking in on your stay throughout, but the noise from the work next door was overwhelming and took away from the tranquility of the setting. We want this hotel to expand so more people can experience it, but knowing that the Christmas - New Year run is one of the busiest of the year, we couldn't understand why ownership wouldn't hold off construction a few weeks thereby completing it in the low season. Overall this is a wonderful place to call home for a few nights with a friendly staff and ownership."

","Perfect stay in a beautiful location!","We stayed at the Viceroy for 3 nights in January 2011. Loved our stay there and would definitely recommend the hotel. Great location and impeccable service while we were there! Nothing but total relaxation, which is what we needed!Arrival - We paid for the VIP immigration service at the airport ($25 USD/person), which I think was definitely worth it. There was a man holding a sign with our name when we entered the airport. He walked us past the long immigration line and took our passports to get our visas while we waited for our luggage. It probably took a total of less than 15 minutes to get out of the airport, which was great after the long trip to Bali. He walked us to our driver, who had cold towels and water waiting for us. The driver was great (unfortunately I am horrible with names and didn't catch his). He was very friendly and told us all we wanted to know about Bali on the ride to the Viceroy. It took about 1 hour to get from the airport to the hotel.Room - We originally booked a terrace villa. At check-in we learned that we had been upgraded to the Viceroy Villa (which is their presidential villa). The room was gorgeous! It was a 2 bedroom villa with private pool and outdoor living room in between the bedrooms. Even though it was just my husband and I, they gave us the keys to both rooms. Both rooms were beautiful - the master had a king size bed and the second bedroom had 2 beds (I think twin size). The minibar was stocked with soda, juice, water, etc. All of the non-alcoholic beverages were free, which was a nice touch. There was also a coffee machine with plenty of coffees and teas. There was always fresh fruit waiting for us in the room when we returned. The view from the room was amazing. Location - The location of the hotel is great. It is not right in the center of Ubud so you feel like you are at a secluded, relaxing resort. The hotel has a free service where they take you into Ubud and pick you up whenever you'd like. It was only about a 10 minute drive. We had the driver take us to Ubud one day from some shopping and then we had the restaurant call them to come pick us up. It was quick and easy and a great service they offer.Food - Breakfast was from an a la carte menu that had everything from eggs benedict to chocolate crepes to Indonesian fried rice/noodles. You chose the entree and it would come with a plate of fruit, some croissants, juice, coffee and tea. I got the fried rice every day (my favorite I had in Bali). My husband tried the crepes and other entrees and liked those. We tried the Indonesian tasting menu one night for dinner and weren't that impressed. The other night we had a 3-course set menu (grouper for my husband and duck for me). We thought that was just okay. Generally, we weren't that impressed with the dinners at the restaurant and thought they were a bit pricey for what we received. We did go to Ubud to try the suckling pig at Ibu Oka. My husband loved it and wanted to go get it every day. Spa - We did 1 hour Balinese massages at the spa one day. The next day we did a 2 hour treatment that began with a massage, then scrub, then yogurt wrap and flower bath. I usually love the spa, but this was the most disappointing part of the hotel for me. It felt like they didn't use enough oil and they were just rubbing my skin to the point where it hurt. Maybe I'm just not a fan of the Balinese massage style but I didn't really find it to be relaxing. Massages are so subjective based on what each person likes so don't let this turn you off from trying it...you might like it more than I did!Service - I do want to mention the impeccable service at the Viceroy. They are always happy to help with anything you want. One day we were doing the bike tour with Banyan Tree and needed to leave at 7:15. The restaurant doesn't open for breakfast until 7:00 but they were happy to open early for us to accomodate our schedule! We chose to just have them make a breakfast box for us and they included tons of fruit and croissants and pastries. They were happy to arrange anything we needed from spa treatments to yoga appointments, etc. Definitely an A+++++ to the staff for their attention to detail!Departure - We were going to Alila Villas Uluwatu after the Viceroy and we arranged transportation with Alila for our departure. The departure was easy and fast and we were genuinely sad to leave the Viceroy.Hope this helps! We loved the hotel and the staff was great. We'll be back here the next time we're in Bali! Thanks!!"

We stayed in a pool villa and would definitely recommend everyone to have this fantastic experience. The view from our room or from the private pool was amazing over looking the Forrest we even got to see a few monkeys playing in the trees. The bed was sensational & we slept so well not like any hotel we have stayed at. The Food was an experience in itself complements to the chef! The overall property is Exactly as the net show it to be.......the manicured gardens, the infinity pools words cannot describe this picturesque location.

","Just amazing.","My partner and I stayed for 7 nights for an R&R Break from Port Hedland. We were so well looked after the minute we stepped off the plane with their VIP Immigration service that zipped us through past all the queues and then transported by ""Made"" our driver to the serene Viceroy. We were there in the wet season but the rain only made our stay more plesant. Our Villa backed onto jungle with a river at the base of the valley which you could hear through the buzzing of the jungle. We were lucky enough to see monkeys jumping through the trees on more than a few occassions. Our villa couldn't have been more beautiful what with the thatched roof marble bathroom, beautiful (larger than) King bed, and our very own pool. The staff were extremely attentive with speedy room service, a daily cleaning service and nightly turn down service. The attention to detail was out of this world, from a constant supply of fresh fruit of so many varieties on the table to all the decorative frangipanis being laid out daily. Food was almost too good - I dare say we gained a few kilos whilst we were there. ""Made"" our driver took us to local temples, shopping, restaurants around Ubud and was very knowledgable about Bali with excellent english. He was more than happy to help out with the obligatory haggling and could not do enough for us. We were lucky enough to meet his lovely family and hope to see them all again soon.We didn't feel we needed to be anywhere or do anything, the ultimate relaxing holiday.We hope to return very soon."

","Now I know what relaxing is...","We recently stayed in the Vice Regal 1 villa. I always thought that I was a pretty relaxed guy and knew how to unwind... Viceroy brought relaxation to a whole new level.We spent our first day in Kuta as it was my wifes first time to Bali and she wanted to experience the hussle and bustle before heading into the Viceroy for the majority of our quick trip.It was hot, muggy and after walking around all morning we were tired and had sore feet. Margy arrived at our hotel in a comfortable air conditioned car, cold wet face towels rolled up and ready, and bottles of cold water waiting for us. The drive took around an hour from Kuta and was a very comfortable trip. His english was great and he was very helpful and answered all our questions about Ubud and gave us some local tips.When we arrived at Viceroy we were greeted by the staff who dealt with the usual formalities before Margy packed our bags into the golf cart and drove us down to our villa. It is a short walk up a steep hill to get from the Vice Regal and Viceroy villas to the front desk, the restaurant and the spa. We didn't mind the walk but if you are feeling extra lazy you can call the front desk and they will send the buggy down to get you.First impressions (spoiler - dont read if you want this to be a surprise, I wasn't expecting this and it was amazing)As you walk down the walkway to the villa you are greeted by a wooden door under a stone archway. As our friend Margy opened the wooden doors up he opens you up to the front of your new home away from home and a bunch of magnificent rock carvings that are over grown with moss and tropical plants. From here on it was our own private heaven.The villa itself was well sized, enough room for us to scatter our bags and clothes everywhere and still have room to walk! The bath is amazing with a large stone elephant head sticking out of the wall. More on this later. Then you walk outside to the outdoor room, swimming pool and our ""backyard"" which overlooks a huge valley where we watched wild monkeys playing in the trees on the other side. A waterfall rushing down the rocks on the other side just topped it all off. This place is amazing!What to do.Nothing. If you don't want to do anything this is the place to do it. The first day we arrived we swam in the pool for a bit, then sunbaked on the grass until we had an afternoon shower, then we read our books under the cover of the outdoor room. We felt like we should be doing something so we then went and booked our spa for the following day, walked up to the restaurant and had dinner, then ordered ourselves some cocktails at the bar (which overlooks the main infinite pool, the rest of the resort and has great views along the length of the valley.The next day we had our spa, ordered room service and read our books by the pool. All day... We felt guilty, but managed to shake the feeling off by going to Ubud for dinner.The following day we hired out a moped that had been arranged by the Viceroy staff. This cost us $10AUD for the day, a good price even by Bali standards. We rode up to the volcano, bribed the police (it cost us $12AUD and we managed to haggle them down from $50AUD!!) and had the worst meal I've ever had. The ride itself though was spectacular, we passed rice fields and while the volcano was nothing special I'm still glad that we went for a ride and just got lost for a couple of hours around Bali. We returned back to the Viceroy and ordered the degustation menu. This is one worth mentioning in more detail, so I'll add this later.Our 4th day was an early one for us. We were out of bed at 8:30am, ordered breakfast in our room then layed by the pool in the morning sun reading. At lunch time we moved the banana chairs underneath the cover of the outdoor room to escape the burning sun, and the shower that followed shortly afterwards. We ordered room service again for lunch. After lunch we kept reading, slipping into the pool when we managed to get too warm and then we'd just jump back out again after a quick dip and read again on our banana chairs until dinner. We decided we'd better do a trip up to the restaurant to get out of the room for at least a couple of hours. We put our ""please service"" sign on the door just in case the room service crew were in the area (we had already told them not to bother twice that day). After another lovely meal and a few drinks we returned to our villa to see it spotless, and the bath was full with warm water and flowers shaped into a love heart for the romantic couple! We didn't ask for this to be done, and we were only gone for a couple of hours so I was amazed that they had managed to sneak in while we were gone and do such a great job. It was a very nice touch, especially for our last night.Our last day we did not fly out until 11pm so were stuck without a room from 12pm. Fortunately we had our complimentary spa (it was included in our package) and what was down to be a 1hr massage ended up being a 2.5hr spa treatment at no extra charge. Unfortunately after this we only had time to relax in their poolside bure and drink more cocktails until they gave us a free shuttle back to the airport to finish up our holiday.Cascades RestaurantVery nice, but very expensive for Bali. We had the degustation with wine matching which ended up at over $500AUD with a couple of extra wines. While the food was amazing they managed to miss out on one of our entrees (the scallops which I was really looking forward to) and one of our wines. This also put us out of whack with our wine tasting. I brought it up with the waiter, however I don't think he understood what I was telling him. He was very helpful and very nice, but this was one thing that put me off. After paying such a high price for dinner I would have expected it to be perfect.Lembah SpaNow this was good. We had a 2.5hr massage and a 1hr massage booked in and both went overtime (as above our complimentary 1hr massage lasted 2.5hrs). The therapists gave us a number of different masks, scrubs, rubs, baths, saunas, showers... and a cool drink to get you started followed by a herbal tea after a dip in the cold plunge pool or warm spa. Very nice.Overall I'd say that the service was great apart from that one moment during dinner and the price. We were there for 4 nights and everything was fine but the cost is over the top for little things (degustation is great, but overpriced at 1,500,000 rupiah each, and a tube of sunscreen cost us $40AUD from the front desk).I'd definitely recommend it to anybody looking to get away and if you can bear to spend time doing absolutely nothing and not feel too guilty it is absolutely perfect."

The experience starts the moment you're picked up from the airport where once in the car you're handed a cool towel and bottle of water to refresh while being transported to the hotel. Every staff member we came into contact with during our brief stay was absolutely excellent, nothing was too much trouble.

Food is truly amazing, the best breakfast one could imagine. Staff is super friendly... day trips were fun too. We had no insects, which was a huge plus, considering that at the previous hotel in Semynyak it was a true disaster and I could not sleep at nights. This hotel had no such issues. The views from the room were breathtaking. So the bottom line is - this is a truly secluded and unique place perfect for couples and honeymooners.

","Great resort with stunning views","Overall, we spend 6 nights at the Viceroy and we had a wonderful stay. We also considered to stay at the Four Seasons and the Cheddi Club before choosing the Viceroy. Once arrived in Ubud, we visited them all and considered the Viceroy to be the best of them all. My wife and I are used to stay at luxury resorts (e.g. Aman) and the Viceroy did live up to our expectations. Short summary of the Pros:- very friendly and helpful staff & management(e.g. room service, organizing day trips, arranging motor bike etc.)- Outstanding food (the french restaurant at the Viceroy could easily compete with the best restaurants in Zurich! It is strange to say but we had the best Foie Gras ever at the Viceroy!). Btw, we also went to the Mozaik in Ubud, but the food there could not compete with the Viceroy! wine is expensive but that is true for the entire region. We had lots of cocktails that were also very tasty. - Beautiful resort with family character which we loved very much. - the view is breathtaking and it is very quite- we stayed at the Viceroy villa (complimentary upgrade) which had it all: space, luxury, pool and privacy. We did not see other accommodation categories but we are sure that these would also be stunning. The bed was very comfortable. - Upfront, we read some reviews about construction work. We discussed this matter with Nila prior to our arrival and she arranged a villa with no disturbance as promised. Actually we did not notice the construction while knowing that it is there. Some minor Cons:- The gym is overall in a very good shape but does not offer a great view. To be fair nor does the Amanusa (Nusa Dua). So for us, that was OK. - Given the $ you pay, you could expect a different type hair dryer. It is a wall mounted thing with very little power.- Since the resort is so close to the nature, you will come across some frogs and lizards. We think it is obvious given the location and did not bother at all. Actually we enjoyed it quite a bit. We had a wonderful stay and would recommend this place to our friends without hesitation."

","Luxury in the Jungle","My husband and I stayed for 5 nights in a garden villa at the Viceroy in July. The rooms are beautiful, the staff is very friendly, the grounds seem like something from a dream. It was impressingly bug-free considering we are in the middle of the jungle. We turned our lights off at 10pm to decrease bugs in our bathroom. Our only negative comment about the room was that it would often smell like stagnant water or an old plant. As we had so many other issues (will discuss in section below) we chose not to tell the staff this and hoped it would eventually air-out, which it did not. But, otherwise we absolutely love the Viceroy and found it amazing. Connectivity to the outside worldOne of my husband's deals ""blew up"" during our stay and he ended up needing to call clients and work on the internet for a large part of our stay. For those who unfortunately need to know about connectivity to the outside world, my husband's mobile phone reception was spotty. I think it has to do with the cloud coverage. Just one level up in the villas (terrace villas) it looked like it worked perfectly. So as his second option, he tried using the villa phone to call out of the country. The staff was very helpful trying to get this to work for us, but it took awhile to get this set up in our room. Eventually, my husband just got his secretary to call our villa to conference him into any calls. Internet speed was very good and pretty reliable. The router broke in the middle of our stay (each villa has its own router) but the staff was very quick at fixing this. As the Viceroy is not a business hotel, I felt they were very accommodating to trying to create a mini-office for my husband.SpaThe spa has rooms for 2 ppl which is nice. We did a 2 hr treatment each. Our conclusion on the massage itself was that it was pretty good, but not amazing. What was a total standout was the lulur (flower bath). It was extremely lush and they had the flowers arrange in a design in the water! When I was doing research into Bali spas I did not see any lulurs with that many flowers! It was so nice. The staff was also very polite in letting us play in the flowers for a longer amount of time. They told us to be in there for about 10 min and I think we were in there for about 20-30min and they never interrupted. The next steps were a jacuzzi and steam room which we actually have at our place so we did not spend that much time in those areas thus still finishing on time.CascadesWe also did the tasting menu. It was very good. Its a great change from the local restaurants and is very romantic. The staff was amazingly attentive. A bug landed on the table and the waitress profusely apologized. I thought it was pretty funny as we are in a jungle. It's pretty insane to expect no bugs to come our way in the open air restaurant, especially since they gave us a great table right at the front of the balcony. That said, I don't recall any other bugs visiting us during the 2 hr tasting. BreakfastRoom service breakfast every morning was great. I don't think we got bored with the selections until the last day. This is saying much as I am not really an egg fan thus I quickly get bored with egg dishes. As we slept in each day, it was great to have the breakfast brought to our room as our ""wake up call."" Perhaps we are just big eaters, but we eventually started ordering an extra entree each day (we liked the pancakes but they were really little for a breakfast so we got them as well on the side). It was very reasonably priced (I think 5USD) and we would just graze on this as we hung around our villa. I also should mention that they have a free DVD and book library which is a nice touch. Overall, a great place!"

","Lovely location, shame about the wedding party...","My husband and I stayed here for 7 nights. We chose the Viceroy for its quiet and stunning location and 5 star service and accomodation. Overall, we had a lovely time however there were a few things which I would not expect from a hotel which claims to be of such a high calibre. My husband and I have stayed at many 5 star hotels in the world and this did not really compare. I would recommend staying here for a shorter time (2 nights) to make the most of the location and then in a truely 5 star resort the rest of the time.The location, as other reviewers have suggested is stunning and makes a welcome change from staying by the beach, which is what most people expect of Bali. We stayed in a Terrace villa which was wonderful - spacious, nicely decorated and clean. The pavillion and pool are wonderful and are what make the villa accomodation - just lovely having an afternoon nap outside overlooking the forest. We did not have any problems with frogs or other wildlife as other reviews suggest and actually found the villa to be relatively bug-free. The staff are great and Made in particular took good care of us. The hotel also offers a free shuttle service into Ubud town which is another great offering as we were able to each out in different restaurants each night and not have to worry about getting back.We arranged a couple of day trips through the hotel which, whilst expensive, were worth it. The spa treatment was great, we had a couples treatment and then I went back for additional treatments - all were very good.What let this hotel down was on the last day of our stay, there was a wedding taking place at the hotel. We were notified whilst we ate our breakfast that morning and were assured that it would not disturb us. As it was our last day in Bali, we chose to spend the day relaxing by the pool and in our villa, making the most of the view and quiet surroundings. This was not to happen....the wedding kicked off at 11.00 and by 13.00, all guests had had a few too many drinks and we could hear kareoke etc from our villa. Around 16.00, all the guests moved on to a couple of the villas and the partying continued, very loud, noisy, drunken and completely spoiled our last day. We complained to the front desk but nothing was done, not even an apology or complimentary drinks offered. I understand that the hotel has to make money and cannot refuse a lucrative wedding booking, however I would have expected to be told about this when I checked in so that we could have easily changed our itinery around so that we were not in the hotel during the festivities. Given the price the Viceroy charges, this is unacceptable.Other reviews complain about construction noise, we were in one of the villas on the opposite side so could not hear anything in the day. What was disappointing however was not being able to sit beside the main pool as that is right next to the construction and there are construction workers going back and forth and staring, not a nice experience.Whilst I would recommend staying here, only stay 1 or 2 nights, not any longer, there are nicer hotels in Bali!"

","Beautiful views, romantic and cozy","We stayed here for three nights during a two week holiday in Bali. Words hardly begin to describe the amazing time we had here. We stayed in a Terrace villa, which had a small Balinese pavilion overlooking the valley. The view was beautiful and it was so peaceful. The room was also more spacious and cozier than we expected. We always felt as if we were the only two people around as if we were having our honeymoon again. It was a wonderful stay."

","Fantastic","Both my friend and I went for a two night stay at the Viceroy and wished we could stay for another two weeks! The location is great and the food is stupendous. The staff is helpful and happy, always obliging. In fact I had an unexpected party and the hotel supplied the utensils and even picked up the food for us! The owner, Otto is great fun and a wonderful host. He took us around his property and made sure we felt welcome. Only one issue- the rooms are really not meant for friends who have problems baring their all i.e. going nude. There is no privacy afforded to those that need to change or shower in private unless you kick the other person out of the room or ask them to wear a blindfold. We stayed in the Garden Villa and all of the villas come with a private dipping pool and outside showers. The sleeping area flows out onto the lounge where the dipping pool, dining areas and day bed is located. Only the toilet is private so most times we had to disappear into the toilet to change. Another thing was the dipping pool is not heated, so jump in with caution!. We were told it was heated and at 11:30pm my buddy jumped in. She came up with chattering teeth. Given that we were told it was a heated pool, we thought they failed to turn on the heater. We called the reception and they said they were sending over a maintenance guy. We waited in our wet suits and after 20 mins their guest relations officer came to say their maintenance person had left for the night. I was annoyed because they could have told us the maintenance guy have left rather than kept us waiting in our wet suits. Nevertheless, there is no perfect holiday so this slight issue fail to mar the overall delightful experience we had at the Viceroy. I am definitely going back for more pampering in the future."

","Enjoyable company retreat","We spent four days and three nights in Ubud for a company management retreat. The surrounding is very different from Kuala Lumpur, and the rooms of the Viceroy really let us enjoy the scenery to its best. Another reason why we chose to have the retreat here was the availability of a conference room. We used the wireless (and fast) Internet and video projector (which was really good quality). There was also a speaker conference phone but we didn’t use it. What we really liked was the conference table. It is very sturdy and made from dark wood and there was space to sit 14 people although there was only 5 of us. The room had air conditioning too, a necessity for those of us who don’t like feeling sweaty in the tropical heat. Some of us had our spouses with us and the concierge arranged activities like seeing the sights of Ubud and spa treatments at the hotel’s spa when we were busy with meetings. On our last night, which happened to be Saturday, the hotel organised a Balinese dance that was performed as we had dinner at the restaurant. The food was excellent and there is such a large selection of wines to choose from. After dinner, we wanted to check out a shisha lounge in Ubud. Although it was already late, the hotel still arranged a driver and vehicle for us. It was a highly enjoyable retreat for us. Thank you to Anthony and the staff for making everything possible."

","A complete delight - thoroughly recommended","We booked the Viceroy as a reward to ourselves for my 40th birthday and it completely lived up to expectations. We stayed in Terrace Villa 2 and loved it so much we wanted to move in!Meals at Cascades were delicious and the spa was also a great experience. Otto, Nila and the front office staff were a wealth of information and good humour, helping us to organise our activities and our daily yoga instructor Ketut (also fantastic and highly recommended). They genuinely cared. The combination of activities and relaxation was just what we wanted but the villa really made our stay with the private pool, gazebo and even a coffee machine! As everywhere in Bali, the price of wine was shocking but this is not particular to the Viceroy. Yes, the hairdryers were lacking but this is a small thing. The team there listen intently to feedback so I expect to see this improve very soon. I wavered during booking when I read other reviews about the building works but I can reassure that they are very discreet and don't interfere at all with a wonderful luxury holiday experience. The Viceroy really made our trip to Ubud something very special. We'll go back."

","Several poor points to point out...","My husband and I stayed for 4 nights in Viceroy Bali for our Honeymoon. I was expecting a lot from this Luxurious 5 star hotel, however, I have to admit that it was not our best selection. I wouldn't say it was a total disaster, but there are many poor points that I need to point out.- We stayed in a villa called ""Viceregal 2,"" but we could hear the TV noise and the conversation of guests from our next door villa SO CLEARLY!!! We had to call the recepetion to turn off the TV and stop talking every night we tried to sleep. It was around 11PM and I don't think the guests were too loud but every little conversation could be heard due to the structure of villa. So we were too scared to turn on the TV or make a bit of a noise because we knew that the next door would be able to hear us. We also heard construction noise during the day when we wanted to stay in the villa.- Viceroy is surrounded by giant forests, yes the view is beautiful, but you cannot avoid nature. Frogs were jumping in and out from our pool every morning, and we had to ask for service to take out the frogs from our pool. AND WHAT IS WORSE, the frogs laid eggs in our pool.... I didn't realize it until I jumped into the pool when I felt the slimy black....arrrghhhhh!!!! It was horror. Also, lizards were crawling on the ceiling of our villa! DON'T forget, frogs and lizards are just EVERYWHERE.-The hair dryer was old style and was not useful.- The SPA quality was poor. The girl kept pinching me with her nails. Or else she kept rubbing my back which felt like nothing.I chose this small luxurious hotel because I was seeking for privacy and quietness, but it didn't work out. The hotel was crowded with people everywhere just like ordinary big hotels.They're even trying to add more villas and I'm sure the situation would be even worse.Good point is....The staff was always friendlyThe restaurant food was delicious!Next time I go to Bali, I would not stay here. Maybe just visit the restaurant."

","A little piece of heaven in Bali","The Viceroy Bali service was outstanding. Starting with Made, our driver from the hotel who met us at the airport with cool cloths to wipe our faces after the 28 hour journey from Chicago and continued to be our driver throughout our stay to Anthony the owner of the hotel and his son who would always stop by our table to see if everything was to our liking and converse. The villa we stayed in was fantastic, no attention to detail was overlooked. We enjoyed the outdoor bathroom that included a garden shower area, plunge pool, recliners, daybed and sumptuous bath. The food and spa were A+ as well. We left feeling very relaxed."

","BE CAREFUL!! RESORT WILL SCAM YOU.","This resort attempted to steal nearly $3,000 from me.I was planning a wonderful trip for my honeymoon this last July. Viceroy Bali was one of my top picks, so I made reservations in February. Later, we find a better deal in Fiji, so we decided to go with that trip. I not only called the resort to cancel my reservations, but sent a letter and fax to follow up. This was in May.On July 15th, during our trip in Fiji, I see a charge on my account for the full amount I originally was going to pay at viceroy bali (not cheap!). In fact, it wasnt even the full amount - it was over $200 more than the original reservation. I was furious, and tried everything I could to speak with a manager or someone who could straighten this up. I sent emails, copies of my original letter, and to no avail they would not remove the charge. In fact, they were downright [--] about the situation. I was forced to call my bank, put a stop charge on the payment, and have the bank go after the resort. What is even more odd, is that the bank told me the charge was made by a Bali grocery store. The whole situation is sketchy, and I expected more from a 5 star resort. I don't recommend them in the slightest. Rude, unhelpful, arrogant, and oh yeah - they scam you."

","An Oasis in an Oasis","This hotel is a sparkling gem set in a beautiful setting on Bali. Form the minute you drive in near the paddy fields to the moment you leave, there is a very special air of calm and almost zen-like serenity.I stayed for just one night but will be back soon as it was a really special experience. Great, lavishly appointed rooms, superb food, a wonderful pool, a spa complex beyond description and a view that is just heaven. Can I say more - the setting and the tasteful way the accommodation, food and service have all been put together is just perfect.I met the owner/manager, Andrew, and he has dedicated so much of his personal energy to this family run business, it is a pleasure to see the success of this hotel. They even offer a free shuttle any time to the nearby town of Ubud - great for paintings, crafts and evening jazz. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a very special, calming, romantic or carefree time. Spot on!"

","Had a totally wonderful time here","During a trip to Bali earlier this year, a family friend surprised us with a one-night stay here. I have stayed in a lot of top tier hotels during my business trips during my working days, and this place now joins the list. I didn’t expect to have a private pool in the villa, which was a surprise. The shower and huge bath tub are separate so that was nice too. Breakfast is served “any time before lunch” and we could have it in the villa if we didn’t want to go to the restaurant. We really liked the mini coffee machine in the room, like those you see in the bar. This is not something you see often in other five-star hotels. There was also a mini chiller that had non-alcoholic drinks in cans and small packets of milk. The family who owns and manages the hotel were always around for a quick conversation. This was definitely one of our highlights of our Bali holiday."

","Breath takingly beautiful","Our first visit to Bali so wasn't sure what to expect. Read some of the previous reviews on this hotel and was a little troubled to hear about the building work going on. However, their website looked fantastic and it was the best looking of all the hotels we trawled through on the internet. So we decided to book a Terrace Villa away from any noise and received a reply from the hotel to say they would make sure we had such a villa. We need not have worried, there was little if any noise from the building work.On arrival we were taken to our villa, Viceroy Regal II; we had been given an upgrade. I wasn't too sure it I wanted this upgrade as we were at the bottom of the slope. However, there were buggies to take you to the restaurant on call any time; we walked up each day however. The villa was glorious and the bathroom stunning. The views of the gorge were amazing and we were even treated to the monkey display (wild ones) on our last night followed the following morning by the monkeys coming to the hotel side of the gorge and playing in the tree in front of our villa.The hotel staff were amazing and both treatments I had at the Spa were great. As it was a big birthday celebration we went for the degustation dinner paired with wine on my birthday . Everything was just perfect and the hotel produced a lovely birthday gateau which I shared with the other hotel diners. A memorable experience and one I couldn't fault.The attention to detail and the personal service are what makes this hotel special and when the owner showed us around the new villas going up we were delighted to have a snoop. It was very defficult to drag yourself away from this hotel, such beautiful surroundings and so relaxing, but you do need to get out once or twice just for a dose of reality. After 6 days here it was sad to leave."

","Wonderful resort, it was hard to leave","We stayed three nights in the Terrace Villa #1. It's the villa where the website video was taken. We were very impressed with the staff , facilities, restaurant and most of all the ambiance and view. A few specifics:Airport VIP clearance. We had our bags and were through immigration in less than 5 minutes. Made, our personal concierge who also functioned as our driver/interpreter was wonderful. He was very patient as we were unprepared without our customary guide books and phrase books of the local language. He arranged a hand off on our final day meeting my business partner requiring a three language discussion and rendezvous. He stuck with us until everyone was together. Very cool and comforting.We spent one whole day with Made touring the volcano, local dance performances, and craft markets. His advise in the craft markets were invaluable. Other than that one day we found it difficult to leave the grounds. We had breakfast and dinner each night at the restaurant. We often had plans to have dinner in UBud but the service and the cuisine made it difficult to spend the additional effort for an unknown restaurant in town. That was a bit lazy but we were taking a break in the middle of a business trip and saw little upside in going elsewhere. The Terrace Villa 1 has the best views looking up the valley to the north. We found the pool, bale benong, and patio completely private allowing us to discreetly sun each morning and to truly treat it as our extended villa.. The pool was heated and was at a comfortable refreshing temperature and would likely be warmer had there been more sun when we were there. Plan on sunning in the mornings as this is the only time you will have direct sun on your patio. There is slightly more sun on the main pool lasting until early afternoon. Construction: We heard very little construction noise. Nothing could be heard from our villa as the water features and the design of the hotel prevents noise from traveling between villas. We did take a walk in the early morning hours and viewed the newly constructed villas now 90% complete. They appear slightly larger with a much larger swimming pool approximately 6 X 15. there orientation would allow more sun into the early afternoon. Plan on watching the the monkeys across the valley each evening. They are the wild version of the moneys you see begging or stealing food at the money forest. I suggest you simply drive by the monkey forest parking lot to see them up close and then watch them at a distance in their true habitat from your villa. Looking at our bill upon checkout we were surprised to find that we spend less than $725 per day at the hotel including the villa, breakfast each morning, an afternoon at the spa, and dinner each night with an expensive bottle of wine. That is a fraction of cost we paid for similar hotels of this quality. See my review of Jade Mountain in St. Lucia which I feel was comparable."

","Amazing - A Hidden Gem!!!","We were looking to get away from the hussle and bussle of our busy life and this hotel was a perfect choise. While this place is prices we felt like we got an excellent value. The staff is very attentive and personable. The rooms are big and the views are spectacular. We stayed in the Terrace villa and it was perfect. If you want something initimate and romantic this is it. We were first put into a regal villa which was more expensive, but after seeing the terrace decided that we'd liked it much better. This place has only 11 villas which is great because we felt like we had the whole place to ourselves. The staff called knew us by name and was very attentive and personable. We stayed for 3 nights and it was perfect. We were originally going to stay for two, but then extended our stay by one more night. What was great is that the staff worked with us to get us a special discounted rate as well. Nila who helped us with the extention is awesome. I think if you choose this place you won't be disapointed."

","Peaceful and surrounded by beautiful nature","I wanted some place quiet and beautiful and I admit I was sold by the beautiful pictures of the villas. In reality, the entire place is that beautiful because of the nature surrounding it. If you are a nature lover, you will really like it here. It made you want to just lay by the pool or soak in the tub or sit at the day bed and read. Room service was available at anytime, which kinda made it hard for you to leave the villa as everything that you needed was provided for: food, water, tea, hot shower, tub, pool, and if you like Toblerone chocolates, they even have that in the mini bar. I had a great time here."

","Avoid until construction finished","Stayed here on honeymoon, least enjoyable of the three hotels we stayed at.A few points:1. The hotel is currently constructing several new villas. This work is visible from all parts of the resort and no room is further than 30 yards from the work. We could hear hammering and loud machinery from 8am to 5pm everyday, both in our room, by the pool and in the resort main pool. Please do not underestimate this - it is very noticable and totally ruins any relaxation you may be thinking of.No notice about construction is available on the hotel website or in any email correspondence with the hotel. This is totally unacceptable and I don't know of any other '5 star' hotel which would treat its customers like this (I also informed the hotel of this but I don't think they have any intention to add this information to their website - they simply told me sorry but the work is necessary (to them, not me!)).2. The standard rates quoted for the rooms are WAY overpriced - ignore the initial prices you are quoted, they are frankly ridiculous (and more expensive than the best room at the Four Seasons Sayan for instance).3. The rooms are very nice, a few weird touches though (cheap nasty fitted hairdryer is a throwback to a travelodge). Pool cold. Bale benong very nice. Air conditioning is not very good.4. Housekeeping and turn down service superb!5. Excellent private shuttle service in nice Toyota with leather seats.6. Cascades restaurant is genuinely excellent - Stick to the casual menu and the prices are very reasonable. It was pretty much empty every night however, the pianist playing away to himself.7. Service is friendly but definitely not slick (does not compare to the international 5 stars, although it is admittedly more personal).The major issue is the construction and lack of information about this before our stay. It is noisy and it did bother us. Without this I would have given 4 stars."

","Viceroy Bali, Ubud","We have just come back from 5 days in the Viceroy Bali . It is truly a 5 star hotel come resort. It is not cheap but it is the best accomodation I have stayed in. The scenery is perfect, the staff are wonderful and attentive and the food is very good. The Cascades restaurant is an award winning restaurant , with a somewhat European a la carte menu. The infinity pool is marvellous. I would not go there however if you have some trouble walking up gradients, although the staff are happy to collect you from your rooom to go up the hill to the foyer.

The location is truly breathtaking although the hotel lacks class, management arguing with local staff should not happen especial at the front desk and everything that can possibly be charged for is. What you don’t read about on the website is the current construction works that really cuts through the tranquillity with the continuous sounds of hammers and grinders and judging by what I can see this will continue for at least the next 12 months."

","Lovely villa in Ubud","We wanted somewhere quiet and peaceful, and the agent where we booked our stay assured us that this hotel in Ubud is what we wanted. She was right - the Viceroy is tucked in a quiet corner, at the top of a valley. We can really appreciate the beauty of nature here! So if you are looking for privacy and peace, this place is it.The villa we stayed in had a Balinese style pavilion over a small pool, and made a good spot to read over a cup of tea or coffee. Everything was spotlessly clean, meals were excellent and the romantic ambience is a plus. Couples looking for a romantic stay will definitely like this place.I have to make a special mention to the wonderful front desk staff. They were really helpful and attended to us promptly, even in the middle of the night when we asked for an extra blanket. Made friends with a couple of them and we're planning to come back again later this year."

","Don't hesitate to book! This place really is that good and you will love it!","The reason for my trip was just to relax and unwind with my friend and we wanted to do this in a beautiful place. Five days away to be pampered and not have to think or do very much... I researched the hotels in Ubud and boy am I glad I decided on The Viceroy.From the moment we arrived in this luxurious haven of tranquility we were treated like royalty. Absolutely nothing was too much to ask for- so nice to have staff that are so accommodating ( for a change). Their attention to detail made our trip just to perfect and memorable.Everything in this hotel is beautiful. The rooms are amazing and they really have thought of everything to make their guests comfortable. The villa-pool, the daybeds, the style, the view...wow!The breakfasts are delicious and the staff will serve it to you in the privacy and comfort of your room if you like but try to make it to the restaurant at least once (in the morning) so that you can enjoy the breathtaking scenery whilst you feast on your first feast of the day.The six course degustation meal was a culinary delight!The infinity pool with a swim-up bar is just gorgeous and be warned that you will struggle to leave the comfortable day-bed if you decide to relax there for a while.Enjoyed a treatment at the Lembah Spa- the flower bath was visually spectacular- a true feast for the senses! The surroundings are so beautiful that once you have a massage in this pristine environment, you will probably find it hard to have a massage in one of the other places in the town. So, perhaps keep your visit to The Lembah Spa as your grand finale otherwise you might find yourself being too critical of the other less ""pristine"" spas available in Ubud. Otherwise, just treat yourself to all they can offer you at The Lembah Spa.The complimentary private shuttle service to Ubud is just another service that makes getting around much easier. You don't have to worry about your safety, comfort or haggling with a taxi driver because all you do is ask the restaurant, bar or spa to ring the hotel (make sure you have a card with hotel's details) and in 10-15 minutes your friendly driver will be there to pick you up! It's just another little touch that makes your trip harmonious. This really is a fantastic service and believe me you will really appreciate how friendly and obliging all the driving and reception staff are who co-ordinate all this for their guests.All the staff at this hotel are amazing and will do anything for you. Jero, at reception, is just wonderful and I cannot speak highly enough about him. He efficiently deals with any matter from your initial hotel reservation to a restaurant booking or any enquiry. Don't hesitate to contact him if you want him to organise something for you whilst on your stay. If you want to surprise or wow your partner and want something organised- I suspect this is the man to ask so that it can happen...magically!Well, if you like the finer things in life, want to escape to a calm, luxurious, rejuvenating and blissful hotel where their attention to detail is impeccable then this is the place for you. Don't hesitate! Do yourself (and partner) a favour and book at The Viceroy when you're in Ubud. I"

","Peace and privacy in this charming hotel","My trip to Ubud wouldn't have been as memorable if it were not for my stay at this incredibly luxurious hotel! My partner and I have been been looking for a hotel in Bali that's discreet and private, and the staff at Viceroy Bali were exactly that - discreet. They were friendly and attentive, and willing to help out as much as they can. They also spoke good English, which we have come to realize is not always a given in Asian countries.Another surprise was the quality of amenities. For a small boutique hotel, they are up to par with big name hotels. The location is pretty decent too, near enough to Ubud's main roads but not that close so that the place retained a calming peace and quiet. We wanted to drive around by ourselves instead of taking the free hotel shuttle, and the front desk helped us by arranging a suitable vehicle rental.I will definitely recommend Viceroy Bali hotel to any couple who is looking for a charming and romantic hotel that offers excellent service. This is the perfect place to spend some quality time with a loved one."

","A slice of heaven on earth.","On the first morning I woke up I thought I had gone to heaven - it was that beautiful. The lush tropical vegetation, the mist, the dappled light on the plunge pool outside our room - it all added up to what one imagines heaven looks like. The hotel is only 5 years old and has been built with style and some beautiful details, like the carved scene of rice being plowed. The staff are extremely friendly, helpful and nothing was too much. There is a shuttle service to Ubud only 5 minutes to the centre of town. The restaurant is one of the best in Bali and the spa offers a variety of treatments. The hotel offers a number of excursions and I highly recommend the rice paddy fields trek. Like all popular tourist places (Ubud has become a big hit since Eat, Pray, Love became a bestseller), one can feel like a target for dollars. But saying no is not taken as an offence and certainly no one pesters in an aggressive way. The Balinese are extremely kind and polite; it costs nothing to be polite in return. The trip was a second honeymoon, and it was the perfect choice - but why wait that long?"

","Luxury - Perfect Romantic Escape","Viceroy is on a Hiilside/dropping down into a valley. This means that each of the villa's have fantastic backdrop and a jungle/forest-esque setting with a river at the bottom.We were going to stay at Four Seasons but changed to Viceroy last minute as it looked like better value considering it is the same class and as the Viceroy is only 5 years old.Villa's are 5 star - pure luxury cannot find a fault with them - we were upgraded to Viceroy Villa on arrival which was fantastic. Also managed to have a look at the Terrace Villas which were fantastic also. The villas are also designed in tandem with the local environment means they blend into the landscape - all of the furniture and fittings are locally made and the artwork is all balinese. Quite fitting given Ubud is the cultural center for Bali.Food is fantastic also - Breakfast was very well prepared and is set up in your room if you desire.The housekeeping staff were very friendly and polite. We had a chat about the local area and about the surrounding villages which was nice.The front office staff were professional and gave us many different ideas for activities - if we had more time we would have went cycling and trekking. Jero was fantastic.Dinner - The food itself is spectacular. The cocktails also were fantastic.Spa was excellent.I cant really find a fault with these villas - our room didn't have a bose ipod dock - probably not really a fault as if it did it would ruin the ambience of the place.Excellent place for romance/honeymooners due to the ambience and beauty of the villas and the backdrop. Will definitely go back when next in Bali."

We are a couple who like nothing better than to lounge around the hotel when on holiday. We felt totally pampered by the impeccable service rendered, from the moment we stepped into the hotel until we left 3 days later. We could choose to dine in our room or eat at the restaurant. The food was delicious and they have such an extensive wine list, which is quite remarkable for a boutique hotel. We could soak inside our small pool in the villa, or use the main pool that had an infinity edge. We could have massage in our villa, or at the spa - we chose to have it at the spa and absolutely love soaking in the large bath tub inside the couple treatment room. We also had the pleasure of meeting the members of the family who own the hotel, Otto, Margaret and Anthony, all of whom were very interesting to speak with. We had a really wonderful weekend, and we know we will be going back there again. We highly recommend this place to couples."

","The Epitome of Luxury and Service","Just returned from 3 wonderful weeks in Bali. There just aren't enough superlatives to describe the exquisite Viceroy Bali, this small privately owned villa hotel is a member of the Small Luxury Hotels of the World.....and ""luxury"" is just an understatement when describing it. We had the feeling when we arrived that this special place was created by someone who has been to every purported ""luxury"" hotel in the world..and then really created the perfect one. The grounds are horticultural perfection amidst the surreal views, the staff so kind and caring, genuine and very committed to a perfect guest experience, hands on owners, a killer spa...and then there's the villas!!!! oh my!!! Heaven, heaven heaven, from the architecture to the furnishings....bliss PLUS fabulous amenities and wonderful private pools, comfy beds and big fat plush towels.. Every little detail for the perfect stay has been carefully thought out. We tried the renowned Mosaic in town restaurant for an amazingly expensive dinner...and can say without exception, the Viceroy Bali kitchen outshines it in every way...we ate every meal except for that one in their gorgeous open air dining room. The only negative is...you'll never want to leave the serene indulgence of the Viceroy and explore everything that the Ubud region offers. We are forever spoiled now and know without a doubt nothing is going to equal the Viceroy Bali experience."

","When soul meets nature. Simply amazing luxury. Lovely and warm owners","More than we expectedEverything at this hotel is beautiful, it has the best accomodations in Ubud with very nice and carying owners and staff. Food is just unbelievable (Chef is 2 times winner of Bali´s best Chef I believe) and the pool has amazing views to the forest.It is very peacefull and quiet and 2 minutes by car/motorbike to the center of Ubud.We stayed there 8 nights during low season and it was supposed to be monzon (lots of rain and thunderstorms), yet we had them they lasted only a while. We had rain only in the evening and enjoyed the lovely pool with spectacular views while enjoying the sun.Our room had a private heated swimming pool in our outdoor bathroom, which was pretty much a lounge same size as the bedroom.There are simply no words.You have to go there."

","Paradise, with service and friendliness","Ubud is clearly more suited for the mature person than Kuta, Legian and Seminak. Quieter shopping, less noise and bustle, fewer eyesores. Located a few minutes out of Ubud on the edge of a deep valleyed forest with a river flowing at the bottom and inpenetrable forest on the opposite hill is Viceroy. Every bit of attention has been padi to detail, the staff are attentive, courteous and professional, the bar, pools and restaurant great. The Spa is to die for.We stayed with two large sons 21 and 23 in the Viceroy Villa - we thought we were in heaven - the boys did too. Excurions and drivers are not a problem. We encourage you to visit and be one of the few able to experience such a wonderful hotel."

","Awsome and a gem of a hideaway","We stayed here for 7 nights in a Terrace Villa. The villa is huge and the private pool is more than big enough for dipping in and out of. The hut over the pool is excellent for dozing during the day and for taking the room service breakfast under (at no extra charge).All the staff were excellent and attention to detail was difficult to beat. The views over the jungle valley are fabulous and it's tranquility is awesome.Food choice is a little bit limited in the restaurant, but nontheless well presented and good value. Wine on the other hand is outrageously priced in Bali due to the luxury tax. Expect to pay around $US100 for a half reasonable bottle. The only fly in the ointment during our stay was the lamb at dinner one evening which was desperately under cooked and then came back cremated. This was only a small point in a fantastic stay.Ubud town is about a 40 min walk, or the hotel provides a complimentary car with timings for drop off and pick up at your choosing.The sundeck area by the pool is quite small and there are only chairs and no sunbeds due to the amount of space available.Overall we would go back to stay at the Viceroy for a relaxing almost hideaway type holiday."

It is so easy to transfer to and from the villa within Ubud area. The food here is so so so delicious. The infinity pool here is perfect. Also there is no mosquito inside the villa.

","A very special Hotel with attentive and professional staff - Magnificient!","Looking forward to a well earned break before the Christmas rush we booked into The Viceroy for 6 nights in early December 2009 into what we found out to be the best resort/hotel we have ever stayed in!(and we have stayed in quite a few) The Viceroy is definately Ubud's best! We were lucky enough to receive an upgrade to the Viceroy Villa which is very luxurious and includes marble floors, comfortable furnishings and our own villa pool - A real eye opener! The view over the rainforest ravine complete with a few shy monkeys provided us with a fantastic view. The CasCades restuarant is no doubt Ubud's best with a wonderful menu and prompt, professional service. The food is delicious and presented well.The wine list as expected was expensive but that is due to Govt taxes - but we enjoyed some of quality wines on the comprehensive list anyway! We had the opportunity through another guest to view a Garden Villa which is also well appointed and good value. The Viceroy tariffs reflect quality villas (constantly kept spotlessly clean) tremendous views and service for people wanting that little bit extra and comfort.We highly recommend The Viceroy and congratulate Otto, Margaret and Antonio on providing such a luxurious facillity.Ensure you enjoy the Lembah Spa - magnificient!"

","Breathtaking","We have recently come back from our honeymoon and for the first 5 days we stayed at The Viceroy. The place is unbelievable, as soon as we arrived we felt very welcome. We were upgraded from the Vice Regal Villa to The Viceroy Villa which is truely stunning, the view across the villa of the gorge was amazing with lots of wild monkeys, one of which came over to the trees by us. The villa pool was fantastic, not too cold at all but The Viceroy Villa has the sun until around 4.30pm so plenty of time to warm it up and the main pool was just as nice and very empty so you felt you were the only people there. The food was delicious, definately try the Indonesian menu, it is not too spicey at all. We ventured into Ubud town and tried the famous suckling pig at Ibu Oka which was very good but get there early as it fills up very quickly! If you want a place to relax and totally unwind then this is the place to stay, it is so peaceful and there was nothing nicer than lying in the cabana listening to the river flowing below.We will definately be staying there again when we next go to Bali, we loved every minute of it, Otto and his wife were very welcoming and helpful as were all the staff who were brilliant."

","Gorgeous!","Wow. The bathrooms alone will knock you out! Seriously killer rooms. We had our own private pool and the kids had a suite next to ours with their own private pool. I think all villas come with them.Dirty little secret of private pools: Not heated. So think of them more as a water feature. The main pool however, wow. The pictures I took in this place were spectacular enough to inspire us to have a book made. Really.The owner is on property and super cool, friendly guy. Austrian.The food was just ok. We are adventurous diners and even ate the famous suckling pig, but ah, just ok.Can't recommend this place enough. You will be amazed and your spouse will be impressed by your internet skills!"

","The perfect hotel for those who love fantastic service and amazing food.","The Viceroy surpassed all expectations that I had. I had been looking for a 5 star hotel in Ubud and just stumbled across it. From the time I first contacted them to the time I left there was not one detail which didn’t blow me away. We had arranged the VIP transfer so when we arrived at the airport there was no line for us! We just gave our passports and forms to a gentleman holding a sign bearing my name. He took care of the rest. We were on our way to the hotel in less than 30 mins from landing. I highly recommend this way of doing things!The actual hotel takes your breath away. Each room overlooks a valley which has a river at the bottom of it. Waking up in the morning and just looking out over it while breathing in cool, crisp air was perfection. The villas are of the highest standard. Every single thing is so well maintained from the furniture to the coffee machine. If you like details then the Viceroy would be for you. The included a la carte breakfast was amazing as was the foie gras and lamb we had for dinner. The chef at the Viceroy gets an extremely high review from me. All staff at the hotel were exceedingly helpful and polite. Their english was great and it was very pleasant to be able to have a conversation with them about daily Balinese life and also get their insight on things.Everything about the Viceroy pleased me from the fantastic villa with its own pool and indoor garden, to the food, the service and the drivers. We were made to feel so welcome and I can’t wait to go back to the hotel. You will not have any regret in staying here.Thank you to all the staff and Otto for being so hospitable to us. Your kindness made the trip even more special."

","Two weeks in a haven of peace","We spent 9 nights at Terrace Villa 1 and 3 nights at the Vice Regal Villa 1. Both of them were the maximum one would expect. All villas have astonishing views on the valley and if you're lucky you might even meet some monkeys! The hotel is one of the best places we've ever been. Everything is just perfect. Initially it was our idea to dine in and around Ubud which would have been easy having a hotel driver at your disposal. But the Restaurant CasCades at the Hotel was so brilliant that we ended up having dinner there almost every night. We tried everything.. from a simple Cheeseburger to a 6-course Candlenight-Dinner and it was just delicious. In Switzerland we would have to run for miles to find food of such quality. We booked a tour with the hotel driver on two days and went to see some of Bali's treasures. Our driver Gama was very special to us, his English very fluent and thanks to him we got closer to Bali's culture and religion. He explained us whatever we wanted to know.All the staff of Viceroy needs to be mentioned as they are all great. They fulfill whatever your wish might be.It is difficult to put in words the emotions we had and still have. The Viceroy is a hidden gem and should you every have a chance to go there, just go! You will experience the emotions as well and hold them dear for a lifetime."

","luxury + this resort is a must stay","I dont have time to say too much but this boutique resort is amazing. Luxury all the way and excellent attention to detail. The rooms are huge with everything you would expect in a top 5* property and more. Complimentry cold drinks, coffee machine, slippers and robes, quality toiletries and more. The outlook is divine, there are 3 seperate chill out areas and a pool in the bathroom. I did not want to leave the resort. It also has a great gym, and a lovely restaurant and pool falling over the cliff. The staff a friendly and professional and they provided an excellent limo service to town. I have interior design background and work for a hotel group and all I can say is this resort is up there. I would ddefinately recommend it to anyone looking for quality, luxury and attention to detail in a beautiful setting. i hope to return and would not even bother looking at other properties next time i visit Ubud. Enjoy!! and thank you to the Viceroy for such a memorable stay"

","Heaven on Earth","Wow!!! How to put the right words here to describe. We started our trip in a private Villa in Seminyak so set the bar high, however after 4 days we were hanging out to get to serene and beautiful Ubud. Can only say that ""The Viceroy"" blew our minds.The staff were fantastic, the food 1st class, the view over the valley and paddy fields divine. Their own website does not do them justice. We stayed in the Garden Villa and our only possible complaint (if you could call it one) was the water in our private pool was a bit too fresh (cool).With only 11 villa's in the complex, there's no overcrowding and the staff made us feel more than at home.Would thoroughly recommend The Viceroy to anyone who is considering it, as we'll definitely be going back."

","Stunning hotel in a beautiful serene setting","We had the most wonderful stay at the Viceroy Bali in Ubud recentlyWe chose a 1 bedroom garden Villa, 190sqm, with an indoor outdoor pool and stunning view.We never wanted to leave, and although the restaurant had a magnificent view, we ordered breakfast on the terrace in our own garden every morning after a refreshing dip in our pool.Then would lay on the daybed and read books.You could walk into Ubud center in 20 mins or use the complimentary shuttle service.But once at the Viceroy you will never want to leave, or will rush back to the absolute beauty and tranquility of the place.We had a huge Super King bed and the the best most restful sleeps we have had in years.We watched the sun disappear from CasCades Bar, chatting to Otto and his son Anthony who own this enchanting family run hotelThe food was excellent, the wine list extensive, the boutique tasteful and fabulousI did not get to use the Gym or the Spa but this also looked stunningThe staff were the best we have come across, I cannot say enough good things about the Viceroy Bali and were very sad to leaveBut will definitely go back as soon as we canLesley Vanderwalt lesvan@optusnet.com.au"

","Beautiful Hotel with Very Attentive Staff","We chose Viceroy because we wanted a boutique close to Ubud center and our own plunge pool...plus we heard 4 Seasons is in need of renovations. In a word, Viceroy was fantastic. Very elegant and tip top service, surrounded by jungle and rice patties. Plus, free wireless internet around the entire hotel and free local transportation.VILLA - We were in Villa 7 which had a huge, comfortable bed, a massive open bathroom and plenty of living space. Keep the bathroom lights off (or dim) at night to keep the bugs away. We wound up not using the plunge pool bc it was freezing and our villa didn't get direct sunlight after 8:15am. FOOD - The food was outstanding. A la carte breakfast was included and came with choice of entree, fruit, tea or coffee, a delicious array of breads. We also enjoyed both our lunch and dinner. It's much cheaper to eat around town, but you won't go wrong eating at the Viceroy. Plus, they have a traditional Balinese dance certain nights.SERVICE - amazing. Very attentive staff. They drive you to the town of Ubud (5 minutes away) AND pick you up! That was a huge plus for us. One night I asked our waitress at dinner if she gets bitten by mosquitoes; she laughed shyly and then, without me even asking for it, returned a minute later with bug spray. Very sharp.SPA - amazing spa and amazing setting. definitely take advantage of itNEGATIVE - only negative we could come up with is you can't get sun after 1 or 2pm in your villa or at the pool. If they cut down 1 or 2 palm trees by the pool, they would get perfect afternoon sun. Also, the hotel charges $100/day for sightseeing tours. Friends from the US suggested we use an indie driver which we did for $50/day. He was fantastic and you can email me if you want his info. Only caveat (which he acknowledged) is the hotel offers a nicer car."

","Beautiful Property","We had a great time at the Viceroy. The grounds were beautiful, there were great views from the villas and the main areas, the service was great, and everyone was really nice. It was very quiet and we never saw too many people around, although they were fully booked while we were there (there are only 11 villas, I think?). Also, the location is great because it's only about 10 minutes from the center of town.We stayed in a Garden Villa but I wish we had stayed in the Terrace Villa. The Garden Villa was very nice - super clean, everything was immaculate and well-appointed - but the Terrace Villa has the bale and a better pool. Our pool was practically in the bathroom and it was very cold so we really couldn't use it. I think the layout of the Terrace Villa was much better. That being said, we got a great deal on our room. Unfortunately, all the rooms only get morning sun for a brief time because of the way they're facing. That was a little disappointing. And the one thing I would ask of the hotel is to cut down a tree or two so you get sun at the main pool in the afternoon! Other than that, it was a great stay.Also, we had an awesome driver named Dewa. I got his name and info from another tripadvisor reviewer who stayed at The Viceroy. He was really great. He took us to a lot of interesting places - galleries, coffee plantation, temples, elephant park - and he spoke English really well. He was very flexible and took us wherever we wanted. He answered all of our questions (we had a ton!) about Bali and the Balinese people so we got to learn a lot, too. He was so nice and if you go to Ubud, you will need a driver, so I highly recommend him. Please contact me for his number and email. He was the best!"

Quite a spacious pool which was in the sun for the morning.The staff were great and the shuttle into Ubud more or less on demand was a definite plus.The restaurant was supposed to be good....at least it had good reviews... However menu seemed quite traditional and a little on the heavy side... no salads or soups for lunch and we went into Ubud to eat every night.Wifi internet in the room was quite slow and kept going off but didnt really matter.We got an excellent rate at the last minute and would definitely stay here again"

","The Best of the Best of the Best","When my husband and I decided to go to Ubud we wanted to stay in a great hotel. What I found confusing when reading reviews is trying to figure out where the hotels were relative to the town of Ubud and which ones were truly the best. After reading loads of reviews we settled on Viceroy. I could not have made a better choice.From the VIP service at the airport (make sure you request this), to the friendliness of the staff, to the location, to the extraordinary accommodation and superb food, this is the Best of Bali. We had a Terrace Villa which I would highly recommend over the garden villa. Everything about the room, plunge pool, bathroom and the public spaces of the Viceroy are exceptional. I am in the hospitality business so I wanted to see other hotels in the area. We hired a driver for two days and one of those days we spent touring other hotels. All of them were very nice but were truly not as good as the Viceroy. I think it is important to point out that almost all of the hotels are not located in Ubud but instead are located in very serene, quiet, gorgeous locations. Ubud is very busy, very noisy and not all that wonderful except for the shopping. All of the hotels will offer good shuttle services. Here's my summary of the hotels that we visited.-Four Seasons Bali at Sayan - pretty setting but noisy with the whitewater rafters who seem to be going by screaming on the half hour-Kupu Kupu Barong - great spa room in the mango tree but accommodation not as good as Viceroy-Amandari - beautiful setting - better than 4 seasons and quieter. If you can afford the villa, it is out of this world but comparable priced accommodation to Viceroy were not comparable. Also visited Amankila which is an absolutely gorgeous setting on the Indian Ocean.-Kamandalu is very close to Viceroy and seemed lovely but not as intimate as Viceroy (which only has 11 rooms)-Semana Villas - nice paddy views but a little run down and in spots smelled of sewage and also a long drive from Ubud-Komaneka at Bisma - lovely accommodation but strange location down a rundown narrow road (although you could walk into town from there if you wanted.) Also did not like the food there (we had lunch).-Komaneka at Monkey Forest - right in town if that is what you are looking for. Again, this place had a sewage smell as you were walking towards the pool.In conclusion, I can't recommend Viceroy high enough. The food is fantastic (we ate there twice because it was so good.) We also ate at Mozaic which was supposed to be the best of Ubud but we found Cascades at Viceroy better. We have travelled all over the world and stayed at some of the best properties imaginable and I can say without hesitation that you can not do better than Viceroy."

","The Viceroy .. Masters of perfection!","I don't think that writing a review will show and express how amazed am I! My stay at The Viceroy was something out of this world. I really felt that I own the whole world. There was nothing in my whole stay that disturbed me or I found it inconvenient at all.First, my booking was for a honeymoon package in the terrace villa for 3 nights which I booked directly from the resort by contacting them by email (Nila was the one responsible for this, whom we found at the front desk on our arrival =) ). The first amazing thing was that Nila gave me a 30% discount so I got an awesome price!The package included a VIP immigration process, and it really was. When we arrived at Denpasar airport, an employee from the airport authority was holding a sign with my name, then he took our passports and asked us to follow him. The amazing thing was that we passed the LONG queue line just by a wave from the mentioned employee to the immigration employee. Then he took 50 USD for me and my wife and it was less than 5 minutes and our visas were ready! (It took my brother about two hours to finish it be his own when he came the last year!).Then there was another employee from the hotel itself wearing the Balinese traditional wear (the Sarong) who took all our baggage and directed us to the car. He was professional and took care of us, and of course, smiling all the time (although he did not speak English very well, but his smile was enough for me :)!). He gave us the cold towels and cold water once we rid into the car.After the 40-minutes ride to the hotel, the reception greeted us for our honeymoon and gave us the welcome drink and also cold towels with the Balinese aromatic flowers around our necks. I found later that the lady in the reception was Nila :). The first thing that really AMAZED me in the viceroy was that we were upgraded to the biggest villa that they have (The Viceroy Villa) with the hotels compliments and best wishes, and this was because we were newly married!! That's absolutely amazing!The buggy car took us to the villa, driving into the breathtaking views of the greeny Ubud! The villa had two bedrooms, one main room with a king-size bed, and another with two beds. The swimming pool was great with the small fountain which you control with a remote control! As our villa was the one at the bottom of the resort, it had the best view on the river and the forest!(the resort is organized on more than one level, it's like it's built on a steep mountain).The staff were always helpful, smiling and willing to make your stay as good as possible. We had the option of American, Continental, Pancake or Indonesian breakfast to be served either in the privacy of the villa or in the restaurant (The Cascades). We also had an unforgettable candle-lit dinner. Their food in general is delicious and on high standards. We also had a 2-hours spa treatments which included 15-minutes foot wash and massage, a 1-hour Balinese massage and 30 minutes body scrub then head and face massage, ending with a floral bath in the bathtub.The buggy service was always a matter of a phone call and it's in front of the villa.I know I would keep writing and writing about this hotel, but I better stop and end my review with my highest recommendation to stay at this hotel especially if you are looking for a relaxing stay. The last thing to say, the hotel price is high, but it's really worth it. :)"

","Outstanding!","Outstanding!----------------The Viceroy Bali offers a VIP immigration service which is defiantly worthwhile, you are greeted by their representative as soon you enter the terminal who quickly & efficiently escorts you through immigration, luggage collection & customs avoiding all the queues & hassles. The Viceroy car & driver are waiting for you when you exit the terminal with cool towels & refreshments. The trip to Ubud takes about 45 minutes, the car is luxurious, comfortable & the driver explains many of the interesting things about the Balinese culture & lifestyle along the way.Upon arrival you are welcomed with flowers & mocktail, the check-in is effortless & immediately you feel like you are part of the Viceroy family.We stayed in the two bedroom Viceroy Villa which overlooks a beautiful valley & had traditional Balinese carvings, huge swimming pool, LCD TV with DVD player, a generous sized four pillar wooden bed, fully stocked mini bar, ample clothing room, air conditioning, spa bath & a water fall in the bathroom. Not to mention the outstanding sized shower. The staff complement this wonderful resort with their attention to detail weather it is the turndown service putting homemade chocolate truffles on your pillows or the concierge who organizes the golf buggy if you don’t feel like walking from your villa to the restaurant or spa.The food is truly outstanding & the chef can cook anything you feel like on or off the menu, I celebrated my birthday in the restaurant & was treated to some fantastic company from the family owners. They truly went beyond the call of duty to ensure I had the experience of a lifetime that I shall never forget.Whilst on my vacation my wife & I experienced a personal guided tour of the volcano, white water rafting, elephant riding & of course the famous monkey forest.I was treated to a four hand deep tissue massage in the luxurious day spa located next to the restaurant, I highly recommend this as a must when visiting the hotel. The Viceroy is unlike any other Hotel for privacy, relaxation therapy treatments, cuisine, staff knowledge of the area, the plain service which is provided by the whole staff & not to forget the owners of the Viceroy are there for any special requests you may ask of them. Nothing is too difficult, too trivial, no request dismissed & thrown in the too hard basket. Where other Hotels have let me down, this Hotel has excelled."

","SECRET TREASURES....","Is there a word or words that truly describe the sanctuary thatViceroy is? Absolutely, defiantly not. It has been twelve months now since my magical stay at the Viceroy,Ubud and magical it was. With no corner over looked, from the finestof fine dining, elegant and luxurious facilities, a truly breathtakingand unforgettable place. I really felt like it was something out of afairytale. I just cannot forget how such a refined resort had me feeling like Iwas still at home. Staff we family not staff and always smiling. Itwas great to be able to be in such a luxurious place and not feeluncomfortable relaxing at the bar in bikini and towel, going to dinnerin a little sundress barefoot…. What a holiday should be, comfortableand relaxed. In my travels I have stayed in some of the most recognised properties,both boutique and international chains, not one of them have comeclose to taking my breath away like the Viceroy, it still feels likeyesterday. I feel that Viceroy has truly captured the heart of the Balinese people. During my stay when I was not enjoy drinks by the pool, letting mytaste buds be tantalized with lavish meals or just treating myself toa massage I watch the sunrise on top of mount Batur. This is a must,even if you have to be woken up at 3am! I could write for hours on all the little treasures I found during mystay, bars, restaurants, shops, villages, sunsets at Ku De Ta but nowords or pictures could ever do it justice. One thing I will say,there is no match for the cuisine, cocktails, view and service‘company’ found at Viceroy’s CasCadeds Restaurant. Viceroy, my home away from home…..I miss you Viceroy :)"

","A treasure in Ubud","This is our second honeymoon and I must say it was perfect .Viceroy Bali is 5 mins away from Ubud town centre but surrounded by beautiful padi fields and its villas are located the edge of a hill. We stayed in Garden Villa and the room is spacious yet cosy . The bathroom is the biggest I have ever seen! There is also a small pool , good for dipping on a hot day . Unlike some resorts that I have stayed in Bali , this resort is not only clean but very well maintained. Breakfast is alcarte , but very sumptious and delicious which can be served at your villa or at the Cacades restaurant.The conceirge are also very helpful and well equipped with local knowledge . Transportation to town by the hotel, back and forth is always very fast and efficent.We also rented bicycles from the hotel to view the padi field surroundings and mingle with the friendly locals . After that , we had a relaxing and good massage at the Lembah Spa. We had a great time at Viceroy and certainly hope to come back to this paradise again!"

","Lovely stay at this all inclusive resort!","The resort is lovely and massive! Two days were not enough for us to explore just one part of the resort.. we just wished there were more time for us to spend there! The service staff are all very warm and friendly..always ready to assist us at any point. We loved the service! Every staff we met greeted us along the way. The check-in was very smooth. Great use of technology at the entrance of the resort to ensure all went smooth at the check-in counter. The welcome garland, drink and towel was a nice gesture. We also got a free upgrade as well as a very yummy cake upon finding out we were there for our honeymoon - thank you for that! There's no complimentary Wifi at the rooms - chargeable if needed which was fine for us as it also allowed us rest & not be on our devices. Rock bar is worth a visit if you're staying at this resort and the elevator ride down (a very short ride) is worth experiencing once. The drinks menu however is not very extensive. The food at the restaurants are generally pricey for Bali standards but I guess it's priced to match the 5-star experience. We loved the ocean pool and the staff were so kind to help us with some photographs! Overall, this all inclusive resort is beautiful! Stay here only if you're planning to spend time at the resort itself or else, you'll go home feeling like you've missed out on quite a bit!"

","Ayana Resor & Spa Review","Very nice resort with great view and warm hospitality. Complete facilities such as Ocean Beach Pool, Rock Bar, Kubu Beach give pleasant experiences during our stay. perfect place for vacation. Room for improvement for breakfast provided (keep the food warm) at Padi Restaurant, free in room wifi service, and mobile phone signal in resort area."

","Overrated do not worth the money","The only positive out of my stay is the friendly staffs but that's about it.The room is way off compared to what is shown on the photos. For USD$400 a night we are provided a room that is old and rusty and only roughly 40 sqm. The sea view is not amazing and both my wife and I were disappointed."

","One visit - is it enough!","We visited Ayana Resort to have a look at the famous Rock Bar. As we were waiting to get to the bar we could see rain coming in, so decided to head to a bar just near the entrance.This bar had a clear Perspex Roof - and had a small wall around it with bar stools. The staff here were overly inquisitive. You could not have had a conversation between yourselves as the staff loitered and became part of the conversation (which may be fine for some people). The bar is covered in a flowing blue glass, which was covered in ants where we were. I was visibly killing them with napkins and the staff just seemed oblivious to it.Eventually the rain did come and really this is where the fun started. The poor design of the bar meant that the roof didn't extend far enough and the water cascded into the bar area with the small wall conveniently trapping the water forming massive puddles. We basically had water lapping at our feet. My wife had to pull her ling dress up as it was getting wet, and we were on bar stools.We had 3 drinks and asked for the bill......well surprise surprise the cost wasn't as shown on the bar prices....with the barmen quickly pointing out the plus plus plus wasn't on the pricelist (which was a small cube with drinks and prices on it). The drinks were 75% more than what we paid at The Mulia Resort, and let me tell you from what we saw Ayana is no Mulia!!!!!We then tried to make our way back to reception/lobby - it was a disaster! There were puddles and large amounts of standing water everywhere. Who would have know it rains in Bali!! Really for a resort that promotes itself at the top end of the market it was not good. You should be able to get from A to B in the resort safely and without having to wear bathers to wade through puddles.When we got to the lobby to wait for our driver, it was even funnier. The driveway was flooded. I reckon if we waited another 30-40 mins the water from the driveway would have been lapping at the welcome mats in the lobby.....again who would have thought it rains in Bali!!!!From our 90 minute visit, from what we saw of the pool area etc.....it is not a place we will be staying at."

","Another memorable stay","Clive Edwards and Christian Jaquier run one of the best hotels in the world, as far as I am concerned. I return to the Ayana at least once a year and my recent trip was no different to previous; the service is beyond 5 star. One of the main differences to other Bali hotels is the staffs English level. I have found in other resorts, whilst all Balinese are polite and smile they may appear to understand you but don’t which can cause delays in whatever you have asked for/need. Ayana staff are very interactive with guests and certainly “go the extra mile”. I have always liked the personal touches like, when you are swimming, the pool boys will re-fix your towels. All it takes is a smile in their direction and the staff will come over and take a drink/food order. It also seems like they have 1 staff member per couple ratio, as you never struggle being served! I got to the H2O pool earlier than when the kitchen opened and they were still able to make my frozen drink up without delay. It is great to see that previous guest reviews have been heard and Ayana now provides free wifi. One recommendation I would make is that I think it’s a bit OTT that water by the pools aren’t complimentary. Given the heat and responsible service of alc, I think an offer of water every hour or so would ensure guests don’t forget how easy it is to get sunstroke in the hotter days.The welcome and departure was seamless. The restaurants are still serving beautiful cuisine and the club was a relaxing/cool getaway from the sunny grounds when needed. The room amenities are also suitable.We got marries at the Ayana 4 years ago and whilst we were there we seen another wedding being set up, it seems things have got even more extravagant in terms of what they can offer and I would def recommend this resort as a destination wedding. The grounds are perfectly manicured and even the gardeners and hotel cleaners stop on their path to smile and say hello which is an obvious sign of the amount of customer service training invested into staff by management.Thanks for having us, we will be back soon!"

","One of the best resort","I have stayed at Ayana 4 times in the last 3 years. It is by far the best resort in Bali I have stayed in. They have all the keys to a great resort with their service, facilities and restaurants. They have both hotel and Villa in the resort offering. I have stayed in 3 villa types, one bedroom, two bedroom and ocean front. Villa pool size wise, you would need to go Ocean front and up to have a decent size for light swimming. The lower grades are more for playing with young children. Villa is always with good size, clean and up to date. Best part of it is still the butler service. They sure know how to make guests feel special and taken care of. There is almost no requests too much for them to handle. From my experiences with resorts, they have the most buggies for transport and always prompt to requests. During breakfast, butlers are always there to either follow up on requests or asking what more they can do.Villa breakfast is separated from hotel guests. Nice and quiet. Breakfast is a la carte instead of buffet. But believe me, the selections and plate size are plentiful and extremely tasty. For greedy eater like me, I ordered at least 3 sets with fresh made customized juices and others. We usually skip lunch cuz we were so full.There are 4 different public pools including one right one the cliff. And there are other facilities to occupy your day in case you do not feel like venture out. SPA is particularly nice, I believe it is famous in Bali.On top of all that, there are many authentic restaurants in the resort. Beach front BBQ place where you can pick out your own food. We went there once when we were newly wed, we had a custom secluded dinner at one of their gazebos. Cost quite a bit, but the rose paddle walk way and everything was worth it. One quick tip, always mention to Ayana that you are there for a special occasion like honeymoon, anniversary or something. They will fill your tub with rose paddles, do up towel swans, paddles on your bed and so on. Great treat for the missus. And their lift to go down to world famous Rock bar is a must go. It is a nice bar/lounge on large rocks by the cliff. Music and nice cocktails with snacks. You would love it. There are plenty more that I have not covered here. But it is definitely a must go resort!"

","More than perfect ! ","The resort has been amazing ! We couldn't have found a better place in Bali ! The staff are extremely friendly n helpful ! It's been 4days n I already feel like home n I do not wanna leave ! The resort is wonderfully spaced out and well furnished! Every small detail is met n every requirement fulfilled immediately ! They know exactly how to pamper you! There is an array of restaurants to choose from n they all serve brilliant food! Sami Sami, kisik, damara terrace, sunset bar and rock bar are the ones we tried! Sekarini at the pool beach loves clicking pictures of the guests ! Dama at the rockbar is more a friend now n she knows how to make an evening special n last but not least our butler ADI ! The stay is incomplete without him ! Every small piece of advice given by him was worth it ! Always always proud of his resort n never tot for a second to help us in anyway !

","Overpriced","The room was dusty, some of the pillows smelled bad, there were so many bugs (including bee) in the room, and the staffs, some of them were not polite. the room service knocked our room and suddenly they opened the door (without waiting us to open it) ..and it happened twice in a night. no wifi in the room, you should pay for it. really?i dont think the room is worth it. there are so many other hotels that offers better room and cheaper price. (including rimba, i wish i booked rimba instead)i went to rockbar and i think it was overrated. the food isnt that great and it was so crowded and hot and uncomfortable. if you want to watch the sunset you can go to other restaurant (the one which served seafood, i forgot the name) or to the pool near rockbar."

The room was spacious and beautiful - the toilet a real highlight for us with a heated seat and other functions. The bed is very comfortable. There are many pools with the main pool by the beach a real highlight. No issues getting chairs by pool at all. The breakfast at the cafe was amazing with a massive range. I really did not want to leave and I hope to come back again. The drinks were a bit expensive but we were expecting that given price range of hotel. Very friendly service with staff all saying hello and talking to you. This hotel"

It was very expensive but worth every dollar - you are truly treated as a VIP. As you walk into the hotel, it feels as if you're walking into a palace. The restaurants and other facilities within the resort make it so easy - you never need to leave the resort. A perfect honeymoon spot, and I hope my husband and I can revisit this resort one day soon!"

Stayed here for few days during my bday in Oct. The property is huge and has some amazing pools. The Ocean beach pool is the best and they serve amazing cocktails. The private Kubu beach is beautiful. The friendly and courteous staff made the stay even more special. I would specially like to thank the staff at Rock Bar for making my birthday the bestest ever. The staff at Rock bar surprised me with a wonderful cake and complimentary cocktail. The cocktails here are made to perfection and are extremely refreshing and delicious. Being a vegetarian, we had limited options but the chef from their Pan - Asian restaurant made amazing Vegetable Biryani and also made arrangements for Indian food for the breakfast."

","Gargantuan resort with its ups and downs","I found the whole of Bali to be too touristy for my taste. This is a decent but a huge huge resort and works like a well oiled machine. If you are traveling for the first time and need a safe place in Bali this can be it. But if you are looking for something special or intimate then stay away. Popular among Chinese tourists so lots of people blankly staring at cellphones, kids running around shouting and loud voices in balcony is to be expected. Can't fault the resort for what it is but this not my type so I won't be returning here."

","Probably one of the best I've stayed in!","Was there in Jan 2016 and our stay there was fantastic! We were upgraded to the club room and it was spacious, clean and very comfortable. The only thing I can pick on was that the bed made some creaking noises whenever we moved; that was it. It was easy to get around both ayana and rimba and I think it's great that we get to enjoy the facilities of both hotels. We didn't have to leave the compound at all in our 3 days there! Lastly, service in the resort was excellent and we definitely felt pampered during our stay. Thank you, Ayana, for making our first trip as a couple so memorable!"

","Some Good, Some Bad","There were some good aspects to the Ayana.1. They greet you warmly with a fragrant flower lei and a cool drink; but it took a long time to check in. The also showed us to a room with 2 double beds. We had reserved a king bed. They did switch our room. We were happy with their willingness to move us and with the room we were given.2. The room was quite large, had a balcony overlooking the putting green and a bit of the ocean, but the decor was a little dated.3. The room was kept very clean throughout our stay, and the staff checked it at least twice a day.4. The staff are very friendly...and there are a LOT of them! They always seemed happy to help.5. The grounds were extensive and beautifully manicured.6. We ate at several of the restaurants. Large portions. Reasonable rates. Good service.7. The Rock Bar was very nice. Yes, you have to wait 20 min to get on the small elevator which takes you down, but we were with friends and had a good time waiting in line, like everyone else. Prices were OK.8. Wi-fi was spotty and slow at times.9. Altogether, I would give Ayana a 4.0 rating.However...we had a bad experience on the last day.We had been very careful to only drink bottled water, brush our teeth with bottled water, no ice in our drinks. On the last day, I had some fruit at the breakfast buffet. Almost immediately I had stomach distress. Bad distress. This has continued for 3 weeks after arriving home. Three of my colleagues who also ate the breakfast had the same distress, and are slowly recovering.Have to subtract at least one or two stars for the bad experience = overall rating of 2-3 stars."

","Amazing resort. Best in Bali.","Was here for my brother's wedding. The resort is amazing from the moment you step in. Soft live music greeting you as the panoramic view unfurls in front of you. The views were breathtaking.The facilities and the villa was simply outstanding. The elegant little touches were impeccable and nothing was missed out. The separate his and hers dressing tables in the bathroom were a nice touch and was definitely a winner for my better half. Really loved the decor. To wake up in the morning and walk out into the jacuzzi and enjoy the sunrise is one of the great experiences not to be missed.The Rock Bar is another place at the hotel worth visiting. Going down in the lift/trolley is quite an experience in itself but definitely worth it even if you are uncomfortable with heights. Villa guests get reserved premium seating so that was helpful especially when it gets very busy.I also have to compliment the resort's wedding planner and staff. The ceremony was perfect and the wedding dinner and reception could not have been better. Perfect location, perfect service, A+++ and more. Will definitely be back again soon. "

","Great people, extraordinary facilities, but standards are dropping","This is our 3rd stay at Ayana, but our first time back in 4 years. The facilities are great in terms of range of landscapes, landscaping quality and architecture. The pools are extradorinary, especally the cliffside pools near Dava restaurant and the Aquotonic Spa. There were however some upkeep issues with our villa and we had to call maintainence on the first night to fix the door, and a leak in one area, a toilet that didn't flush and also the evening lamps in front of the villa weren't working.The people that work here are extraordinary friendly, and any time we raised an issue or had a request it was promptly resolved.One issue that has become problematic is that the buggy waiting time can often be 10-15 minutes. For a 5 star resort like this, I think 3-5 minutes is acceptable but 10-15 minutes is just too long. I don't think they have buggies waiting in areas where guests are likely to need them. Rather it is a system where you have to call your butler but it seems to be an inefficient system. So in terms of facilities and service friendliness/attentiveness I would give it a top score, but in terms of maintenance standards and the system for managing the buggies and getting guests around the resort, it could be improved."

The rooms very comfortable and they have a beautiful view. You can have delicious food and drinks whenever you please which makes it well worth the extra splash. The pools are amazing the only thing which they could improve on is making the pools a little bit warmer. I would highly recommend Kubu beach and the giant spa with the jets is amazing!!! All the restaurants are sensational here the Japanese, seafood and dava were the hits. We stayed in a villa for 2 nights if you are looking to splash out for a honeymoon do this but we felt the club room was sensational and we already had pools over the hotel and did not really need this.

","Amazing -- even in the cheapest room","I went to the Ayana with a friend for two days after a work trip. We grabbed the cheapest room in the resort, presuming that it would be a disregarded closet that would allow us easy access to Ayana's beautiful pools and sunset views. However, we were pleasantly surprised. Unlike a few other high-end resorts I've been to in Bali that really skimp on their cheap rooms, the Ayana's resort view room was incredible. Comfortable beds, adorable robes, plenty of free water and beautiful furniture. Overall we felt completely welcome and relaxed when we were there. The pool by the Rock Bar is spectacular, but we'd also recommend the pools up top that overlook the resort grounds. We'd absolutely go back and would recommend this to friends."

","Breathtaking, magical, amazing!!","Ayana resort makes me want to go back to all of my other 5-star reviews and downgrade them. I've never stayed anywhere as magical as this in my entire life.We stayed in an ocean front cliff villa and it was simply outstanding. The decor both inside and out, all the little touches like the bath filled with rose peals, the view from the pool...it was simply incredible. Outside of the villa, we visited Kubu Beach (best beach ever and the lifeguards are hilarious!!), Rock Bar (villa guests get reserved premium seating), Kisik (an amazing seafood restaurant with the waves crashing below) and Padi (the Indonesian restaurant). There are countless pools around the resort but our favourite was the infinity pool just above the Rock Bar - it's breathtaking (and the Pina Coladas and coconut prawns are out of this world!).But what really made our trip was the butlers who looked after us and for whom nothing was too much trouble. Gus, Gus Adi, Yandi, Putra, Anom - you are all true gentlemen and I loved seeing your big smiles throughout our stay. Thank you thank you thank you for everything you did for us!! You made our stay so very special. You're not allowed to leave Ayana as I want to see you all again next time please!! The other staff around the place were also excellent - everyone was happy to chat and make us feel really special. The serving staff at Sami Sami were especially lovely at breakfast - thank you for our signed leaving card on our last day, that almost made me cry!!My partner and I got engaged a few days before we arrived at the resort and on our first night we came back from dinner to a huge 'Happy Engagement' display made out of rose petals and frangipanis. Other nights we came back to cakes, to Balinese coffee, to towel monkeys hanging from the ceiling....it was amazing, it really was.Needless to say there will be many, many more trips back to Ayana...we're even hoping to hold our wedding there in 2017."

The staff are friendly & professional & the views just speak for themselves. The rock bar and the restaurants are also great too.I also tried the sunrise yoga this time and it was amazing with the best view, great way to start the day.

","Amazing holiday ","Best decision to stay at Ayana. Being my first trip to Bali, We couldn't have chosen a better place to stay. The staff were amazing, specially Made Sekarini, she made us feel important and cared to our every need plus more!! If any couple is looking to get away go and see Sekarini at the pool looking over the ocean. It will be the best decision you make:)"

","A Resort that we will never ever wanted to forget!","We love this resort so much!It was our first time staying in this resort, I still can remember the first impression we had as soon as we stepped into the hotel. We were so amazed with the welcoming team who was helping us to check-in our room.The overall resort and room condition are perfect, nothing much to critic on, the staff working over there are nice, they are so humble and helpful, the foods are so delicious. The only thing that we get disappointed was - the room WIFI. For us, WIFI is a necessity for everyone, we can't accept that a room cost us so much can be without free WIFI (we have to pay if we need to have in-room WIFI), the worst part was, we went to the check-in lobby to get online but the connection was too poor until finally we gave up. It will be perfect if the hotel can do something to improve on this. In general, very good service they have given to us, start from check-in until we check-out, they always very responsive to our enquiry and never let us down. Ayana has a very good team, I should give them a compliment on this. A few places that I would strongly recommend to visit to: Kubu Beach, Rock Bar, Orchid Tea Lounge (@ Rimba Jimbaran - got free shuttle bus to bring you there), trust me, you will never get disappointed!"

","Wonderful stay at Ayana Resort and Spa! Heartwarming and curtious service from check-in to check-out!","From the time we arrived at Ayana Resort and Spa we were overwhelmed by the kind greetings and attention during check-in with the presentation of a flower lei and a delicious fruit punch drink while admiring the panoramic view of the garden Resort and Ocean. We were then accompanied by one of the greeting staff to our room and briefted on our accomodation and on the many attractions and restaurants available to us during our stay, she provided us with a detailed map for our convenience, of which we fully used during our stay.Our room was spacious and very clean, we also had a day bed on our huge balcony. Paid wi-fi in the room but free wi-fi in public areas.The staff working in the many restaurants we frequented were very pleasant and efficient. We must point out that the breakfast buffet is extensive and well presented, catering to all diets and taste.The grounds are spacious and well maintained, the many pools and hot natural zaccuzi are clean with no taste or smell of chemicals.Eye pleasing during the day the grounds are magical during sunsets and night lighting with their water falls and statues.Enjoying an entertaining evening at the famous Rock Bar, carved into a rock cliff. A cable car transports you down the cliff to a seating and lounging area for food and drinks and there is also a pool that is open until sunset. You have to experience it to believe it.During our stay Ayana supplied a shuttle to beaches and spas including the use of their partnered Hotel Rimba which is situated a few kilometres away. On one occasion we enjoyed brunch and a late night rooftop Mexican restaurant.Even checking-out was a nice experience with cool towels presentations and great smiles from the staff while being escorted by the luggage porter to our waiting ground transportation.A beautiful experience and one that we will definitely be repeating.Richard and Faizal"

","Fit for a QUEEN!!!!","SUBLIME!!!!! Okay let me preface by saying that my name is AYANA, so I am a bit biased. lolI picked this resort because I thought it would be awesome to spend my Valentines birthday at this resort that that shares my name. I stayed in a private Villa which was absolutely superb!!! We had an outdoor shower, private pool, outdoor massage table and breathtakingly serene view. Everyone at the hotel was extremely helpful and I received top notch service! On my birthday the resort send be a rose bouquet and cake!!The only con is the beach is really small and we had to walk down a million steps to access the beach. Ugh If you are a beach person then it sucks that the resort beach isnt that great but there are tons of beautiful beaches in Bali to visit.The restaurants were a little pricey but that is to be expected at a luxury resort. If you have a villa then breakfast is free everyday and I personally loved the breakfast at Dava, the food was fresh and the view spectacular!!!We went to the Rock Bar for Valentines Day but it was very crowded so we ended up going back to our villa and the sunset was just as beautiful from our backyard. Awesome resort in Bali!!!! If its a special occasion I highly recommend splurging for he Villas!!!"

","Too busy and too large ","It's indeed a beautiful resort however if you are looking for a quite hotel especially for a romantic holiday I don't think the hotel is ideal. Iris too busy and it is too big. Breakfast looks like a canteen - so many ppl with mainly Asian food items . Only on the last day, accidentally we hit to know that we can go to the neighboring hotel which belongs to the same hotel for a quite and European buffet breakfast."

The staff were so lovely and bent over backwards to make sure we were looked after in every way. I have some dietary requirements and the kitchen and wait staff were so accommodating and made our stay so memorable. Our room was so beautiful, from the views, the robes, the decor and the space, just magical. The ocean beach pool was definitely a highlight of our trip, drinking Mojitos and watching the incredible Ayana sunsets. Ayana is definitely a place to add to your list, you won't be disappointed.

The staff were always very hospitable and they made us feel very special everytime we visited. Rock bar and Ocean Beach Pool is very special and one of a kind, and it's hard not to stay at Ayana because of it. A special mention goes to Miss Made Sekarini at Ocean Beach Pool, who regardless of weather, even when it's hot as, she always deliver service with a smile and made sure our visit to the pool is enjoyable. Her joy, kindness and hospitality is the heart and soul of Ayana, and what made us coming back for more and more. Keep up the great work Ayana! Can't wait to return!"

","Review of AYANA Balinese Cultural Experience","We are guests of RIMBA and decided to attend the Balinese dinner buffet. It was a wonderful experience, especially for some one like me who has a severe peanut allergy. They were able to cook food without peanut satay sauce and the chef walked with me through the restaurant pointing out non peanut dishes. The food (especially dessert and fruit) was amazing! Not to mention the kecak dance and performance. My husband and I theoufhu enjoyed the experience and all the excellent service by our waiter ERWIN! He's the best!"

Room was excellent. We loved the essential oil in the room and bought lots of them to bring back to Australia and we have been using it everyday. Thank you Sekar, we'd definitely come back to Ayana and you have made it easy for us to decide to come back to Ayana. Keep up the good work Ayana!!"

","Pricey resort but with great view!","The location is superb with breathtaking views. No doubt about it! Unfortunately, it was a bit too pricey. Booked the resort thru Agoda & made the full payment. However, it was shocking when we checked in & have to pay another supplementary charges due to over capacity. The room was good enough for 4 pax as I specifically asked for 2 twin beds but then since my children are big, one is 15 & the other is 12, the resort had to charged me extra. The breakfast buffet were also not that great. Not many variation & choices....some more since we were Muslims. It was an experience for us to stay there but then we will never stay there again."

","Heaven!","We stayed at Ayana for five days. It was so lovely in every way we will return. Some reviews say the hotel is old-fashioned, (built 1996) but we found it gracious, luxurious with fantastic attention to detail. It is more 'classic' Bali than modern minimalist. We were blown away by the beautiful pools and gardens. We took the Club option which gives you access to an ocean-view private dining room with all-day food and beverage at no-cost, late check-out and exceptional service from wonderful staff - but we found that throughout the resort. The famous Rock Bar did not disappoint, but it is a national tourist attraction so people come from all over the island to watch the sunset there. Hotel guests do get priority. As soon as the sun goes down - many people leave so it gets quieter. But the vibe is great - very hip with DJ & music and cocktails - like a film set! The hotel beach is accessed by hotel shuttle car and is a climb down and up. You can swim here (some reviews say you can't) but the surf does get up a little depending on the tide. We loved the swimming and the water temperature was perfect. It is patrolled by lifeguards. There are covered day-beds on the beach along with a beach menu and so it is a wonderful day. We found food and beverage prices comparative with Australia - a little cheaper probably but then you add in the location and the service and they are very reasonable! Some reviews say the resort is a little out-of-the-way but taxis are very cheap and very happy to take you around. We visited Seminyak for shopping twice (about AUD 12ish one way) and did a great day cycling trip that took in Ubud and many small towns. Well worth it. We used both the gym and spa facilities and could not fault either. Sister resort, Rimba, is next door and guests can use either resorts facilities. Rimba is modern and sleek, and much smaller than Ayana, but the service is the same. My partner works and travels extensively in SE Asia and says he has never experienced service like we received. A special mention must go to the lovely team in The Club who made it feel like we were coming home every day. Congrats to the management team for this exceptional experience."

","Disappointed ","This is my first review on trip advisor and unfortunately it's bad. The service at Ayana is terrible the staff are rude and hover over you. They asked me to pay my bill before I had finished, then said I could get more after I paid, which I found really offensive. They have no signage for where to go or what services are available. Over all a terrible experience, I would recommend to go to The W or if in Jimbaran the Four Seasons much better."

They also have a private beach, Kubu Beach which is stunning. And to make it all easier they provide you with shuttle to go all around the area, the beach - spa - Rimba.

We keep coming back to this resort due to three reasons:1) restaurants- the variance and quality are truly outstanding compared to any other location we have been to2) pools- the amount of pools is wonderful and even few slides makes this top place for kids as well as adults- Kubu private beach is fun with the massive waves3) service- I dont know where to start, as the genuine will to smile and serve the guests is so incredible- special thanks on this visit goes to a) staff at Kubu (incl life guard guys who saved my sun glasses from the sea and a man from near drowning today); b) Pool staff in Rimba and Ayana; c) Personnel at Unique bar"

","Bali Plus Plus","If you're looking for a treat this is the place. Excitement, excellence and Eden like setting.We had a beautiful large room on the top floor looking over the gardens towards the sea. It had the quietest air conditioner I have ever experienced, and a large balcony with a daybed for chilling. We had to pay extra for a roll away bed which included breakfast. The spa looked wonderful and the restaurants were great. Kids club area was gorgeous and the pool had a slide and kiddy sized lounges and umbrellas. Our kids were too old for the activities (age 10 max) but they looked fun. There is a shuttle bus to the Rimba and the Villas which had more pools and restaurants.The Christmas tree was spectacular and the Christmas decorations everywhere, and carols sung by the orphanage made it a special time for our family. We even got to plant a tree in memory of our stay. Only negative was the cost, the 'additional charge may apply' in small print after most activities and the 'plus, plus' which is the 10% service charge and the 11% tax added to everything! (And this resort is not cheap). But on the plus side the service and setting far exceeded our expectations. Highly recommend this place if you can afford it."
