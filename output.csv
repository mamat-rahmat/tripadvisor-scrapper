"Ciamis","Tyara Plaza Hotel","3.5 ","Basic but cozy enough","Room was cozy enough. The hotel also has a big swimming pool. However, breakfast was very limited and should be improved. No lifts but they have a porter to carry your bags. Smooth check-in/out. Close to restaurants. Wifi only in the lobby."
"Ciamis","Tyara Plaza Hotel","3.5 ","Local food at Ciamis","Stayed for 1 night. Decent room but Bring along your own bath towels and blanket. The buffet is not so good and I strongly try the local food at bubur ETOM downtown ciamis. Must try the bubur kacang ijao and the bubur ayam . The food is really Good ."
"Ciamis","Priangan Hotel","3.5 ","It's ok","Average choice to stay in Ciamis. The hotel cleaness is good. I took a vip room with my family with rate idr 490k. Staff need better training how to entertain guests. Location is good and quiet enough from traffic sounds. The swimming pool is not so good.. small size, water not so clean, pool box shape is not interesting."
"Ciamis","Aquarium Hotel","3 ","could be a better hotel","(+)1. spacious room with 2 king size bed2. big waterpark for children to play. love it :)3. wifi is good only in lobby and dining area at level 1.4. near to beach and nature park5. balcony with pool view 6. very friendly front office and reception staffs. easy to book and check in, especially with help of mr. erdiyana. thanks:)(-)1. the room is not well maintain, such a pity because it's a new building.2. the bathroom seems dark because of wall color and the lighting. but they provide hot water for shower.3. very simple breakfast buffet and the taste is not too good.4. room, bathroom n surronding area is not too clean. they need to put more effort in cleaning matter."
"Ciamis","Aquarium Hotel","3 ","Noisy","Nice big room but when i stayed there it was too noisy with a bunch of people gathering karaoke with big keyboard and speaker at late at night which make us difficult to sleep. The small waterboom is so dangerous."
"Ciamis","Aquarium Hotel","3 ","Three Star Quality Hotels","Eventhough this hotel doesnt have a star rating, but overall the quality is pretty impressive, with tqwo king size beds and the hotels provided mineral water for 4 persons (4 bottles). Perhaps the hotel may improve the quality further by provided four towels, four toothbrush, four pairs of sandals as everything should be enough for 4 persons without having to asked the front desk, as the hotel itself had provided 4 coupons for breakfast anyway. The breakfast want really good, only provided fried rice and fried egg and friend noodle and the breakfast time was not start as stated in the coupon ""6am -10am"" instead start at 7:20 am, should be more disciplined. But the hotel located in very good location, just walking distance to the beach and nearby the hotel there were lots of shops and restaurant and cafes, great choice for tourists. The hotel has swimming pools, nice AC and nice hot shower, pretty impresive hotels with good value of money"
"Ciamis","Flamboyan Hotel","4 ","a nice hotel but...","i was staying here for 1 night, and didnt get any warm welcome from the receptionist, even she say thank you she still show me a flat face. no smile at all. the room was good and the breakfast was great since it's budget hotel but they provide many choices for the food. and it's located in the center. within 5 minutes walk to mesjid Agung and another food stall nearby the hotel."
"Ciamis","Flamboyan Hotel","4 ","Nice hotel with a strategic location","I just check in to the hotel. The front office services are well. Rate of the domestic guest differ from non- domestic. The services are fast when I request an extra bed. Room is clean with hot shower running well. Quiet satisfying."
"Ciamis","Flamboyan Hotel","4 ","A All-around Good Hotel","I have a pleasant stay for few days with a well-built hotel, clean, well-sized room, hot-watered, vast choice of TV channels, nice bathroom, nice bed, nice art-works, rich variety breakfast, and good location! The Will stay again for sure!"
"Ciamis","Flamboyan Hotel","4 ","A Gem in West Java!","We recently stayed at the property and immediately was floored upon looking at the newly renovated lobby.We stayed in the 3rd floor rooms with a bunch of family members and had a lovely time.The beds are quite comfortable, with extra pillows and sheets inside the wardrobe.Bathroom is similarly new as well, with Toto fixtures and a separate cubicle for the shower, no overly soggy bathrooms here! Water pressure can be a bit weak sometimes but not to the point where it stops you from being clean.Entertainment-wise, the flatscreen TV had a lot of local and international channels. Internet is spotty, but is adequate for light-weight browsing and emails. You're better off with a modem and a prepaid SIM card for your streaming needs.Breakfast and staff are where this hotel shines! The front office staff are attentive and quick to respond to requests. Whilst the others are always polite and genial in their interaction with my family.The breakfast Buffett is stocked with local favorites like fried rice and chicken congee. For those wanting more variety, the restaurant offers freshly cooked eggs of your choice and hot waffles. Big kudos, quite possibly the onlyHotel in this side of West Java to have a continental selection alongside an Indonesian one.All I all, we had a lovely time staying in Flamboyan and will be back should we find ourselves in the area."
"Ciamis","Flamboyan Hotel","4 ","Rat !!","I've staying one night with family. Minimum its facilities. sandals was not provided and employees who are not well-educated.I'm sure I will not be back here .. unimaginable .. I saw a rat running around in the room. how can a rat come to stay in a hotel room???"
"Ciamis","Hotel Asri","3.5 ","Hotel Inside Mall","Hotel Asri located at top floor of a Mall Asia Plaza. Complete facilities with pool and big aula and there is a garden with filled orchid flowers in front of the rooms. Rooms are quite spacious with complete guest amenities. But, a little bit still smell of a cigarettes. Wifi signal is bad. Breakfast buffet it's ok with choices menu."
"Ciamis","Hotel Asri","3.5 ","Cheap & Cozy Hotel","With a 58 rooms, good facility (Coffee shop, Buffet B'fast, Gym Centre, Chinese Resto) and big ballroom. With a very helpfull staff.Hotel Asri attached to a big mall in Tasikmalaya (Plaza Asia).Near to the cullinary place"
"Ciamis","Hotel Asri","3.5 ","Give other hotels a chance","Cheap? Starting rate is at Rp 500,000. At that price Santika might be a more attractive option (I haven't had a chance to stay there though)Room is so-so. Mosquitoes can be found in the room.Bathroom is basic.The only plus point is its location above a modern mall."
"Ciamis","Hotel Asri","3.5 ","Complete transit hotel","The room is big, A/C is good and very cool, they are also swimming pool and gym available here, and its attached to a big mall in Tasikmalaya...The front desk officer was very nice and helpful. And the rate is quite reasonable.. like this hotel and definitely will be back here on next trip..."
"Ciamis","Hotel Asri","3.5 ","Big Room ","This hotel have big room, even without window but you can book for VIP or VVIP they have nice family room. Have gym center and swimming pool. But I find bug (little cockroach and big flying ant) I hate that :( This hotel have light breakfast. Connected with mall Asia so you can explore cinema or shopping."
"Ciamis","Hotel Asri","3.5 ","Air Conditioner is leaking, man!","Very good location, coz it's on the 3rd level of the mall in tasikmalaya.The room is very spacious, with clean toilet, and good view.Breakfast was ok.The staff are friendly, and helpful.Buttttt, like what I said, the air conditioner is leaking, and make the floor slippery.Don't bring heavy luggage, they have no elevator for you."
"Ciamis","Hotel Asri","3.5 ","Good by location only","My family booked 2 rooms for 2 nights during idul fitri holiday. The rate was very cheap, the rooms were ok, we got standard rooms without window, i don't recommend this type of room if you're a claustrophobia.The cleanliness of the hotel was terrible, i found faeces in the toilet at the lobby, the flush was broken but they didn't put any sign. This hotel has a strange policy on the usage of the fridge, you have to pay deposit 100idr then they give you your key for refrigerator, never have this experience in another hotel.I'm a hygiene freak so i don't think i want to come back to this hotel, i prefer santika hotel for sure. But my children love this hotel because it's in a mall and next to teejay waterpark."
"Ciamis","Hotel Asri","3.5 ","Very nice hotel!","Stayed there for my cousin's wedding,I only stayed for a day,the hotel is very nice,strategically located,it's located in a mall,so whenever you need something you could just go grab it without having to worry about how long will it take,the mall has ace hardware,pizza hut,solaria etc,the cleanliness of the hotel is top notch,very cozy,I love how they put the massaging stones in the middle of the hotel! It gives a very earthy vibe,the service is excellent,the pool is okay,considering that it's located on the top of the roof,it's nice for family to splash around and have some fun,Overall,it's an excellent hotel & I'll definitely come back whenever I visit Tasikmalaya!"
"Ciamis","Hotel Asri","3.5 ","Good & Decent","Stayed for one night during business trip & overall we satisfied. Breakfast is mediocre but good enough for filling your stomach. Clean & well maintained. Located on top of a mall so is pretty convenience."
"Ciamis","Hotel Asri","3.5 ","Good and Clean Hotel","i stayed here for 1 night on business purpose, the location is prime. it's located on -i think- the above of the biggest shopping mall in tasikmalaya if you want to shop, just go down. the bathroom is clean, shower only. no bathtub. if you want bathtub, ask fort VIP/VVIP room. the recepsionist said those room with bathtub in it. the TV still CRT. they have small swimming pool and fitness center. for small town like tasikmalaya, this hotel is good. the breakfast is OK, but nothing special. the service is OK. the hotel has multifunction room for wedding reception, big seating dinner, etcover all i have nice stay here."
"Ciamis","Hotel Asri","3.5 ","Nice family hotel","Tasikmalaya is my husband's hometown, but now we live in Bandung. We visit Tasik 2 or 3 times a year and Hotel Asri is always become our first choice to stay in. The hotel itself is located in the biggest mall in Tasik (Asia Plaza), right on the center of the town. The price also is very reasonable.Hotel Asri provides basic need for family: clean bathrooms, standard rooms are quite spacious for one additional bed, the family suite is perfect, and variant breakfast. The rooms are still in good condition even I wouldn't say it's perfect. They have small garden and large parking space near to its entrance thus we don't need to walk too far to reach the hotel from our car. They also have a big, beautiful, salt-water aquarium - with stunning colorful fish and coral - at the lobby - which my daughter loved to see very much. They have a small swimming pool, not that special - but don't worry, there's a big water playground nearby (Tee Jay).Overall, I would give this three star hotel four stars. This is the best hotel in Tasikmalaya."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Business and Leisure","My favorite hotel in Tasikmalaya...love the room size the view of the mountains from the room is spectacular...i could just sit on the sofa with a cup of hot coffee and a book and just lounge with that pretty amazing view...i love the pool...its nice to sit and chill after a day out and about exploring Tasikmalaya...I also enjoyed the wide selection of breakfast available at buffet breakfast....and last but not least the staff at the front desk and the bell boy are very customer orinter...helpful and very friendly...very welcoming...i would definitely come back to stay in Santika Tasikmalaya on my future trips to Tasikmalaya."

Thanks to Mr. Aga For your Assistance while we stay there 3. Wish that you have a new variant food and taste , have excellent service esp. for receptionist and reservation team"
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Personal Welcome Pack At Room","We are greeted with a plate of pizza, banana cake, and a personalized welcome letter in our room. It is really pleasing. The room is clean and comfortable. Our view is the swimming pool, which makes it more relaxing after our long drive from Banjarnegara. Swimming pool looks refreshing from our room but we don't have time to take a swim. Breakfast is great with continental and local cuisines. Kompas newspaper is sent to our room in the morning. Overall it is a great experience to stay here."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Enjoying Stay","Easy check in, Friendly and helpful staff, wide variety of breakfast menu. New Spacious Room and clean. We arrived at the evening, reception treat us well and we've been served really nice hot ginger drink on arrival. Location really in centre of town near Wisata Kuliner area, every thing at walkinh distance. Will recommend to friends and relatives"
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Nice hotel","Nice hotel to stay in tasikmalaya. Strategic location. Nice staff. Narrow room. New building. Limited varian of breakfast menu. Limited parking area. Unfriendly staff. National hotel in tasikmalaya. Near alun2 n masjid agung"
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Brand Name Hotel in Tasikmalaya","I always stay in this Hotel when I home leave, ( Lebaran season, Chrismast and New Year) Comfort, good atmosphere and clean.the staff also welcome.Location in the center of Tasik City, Near shopping center, and also near the grand mosque.Only the swimming pool not warm, its means too cool for me."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Unconvinient incident","First you stepped at this hotel, your first impression must be what a lovely hotel with friendly staffs who greet the moment you set your foot at the lobby. But I had an unconvinient experience early this December when I stayed there with my family. We requested 2 rooms and an extra bed for each room. My husband called the hotel from Jakarta and kindly asked the staff to install the extra bed for each room right away (the hotel staff mentioned our room numbers already). On the way to the hotel, my husband called again to make sure that the rooms were still available along and also remind the staff to install the extra beds due to our very late check in. The hotel staff answered that they will do it. But approximately, 4 hours later in our exhaustion from the traffic journey from Jakarta, we reached the hotel, and we were kept waiting for more than a half an hour because they hadn't install the extra bed. We were very dissapointed of this incident. This was not the first time we had problems with our room during our stay. The last time we stayed, the staff did not provide us the non-smoking rooms as we requested. We hope that other travellers won't experience the same thing, and we hope that Santika hotel can improve the service quality since we heard that it is the best rated hotel in Tasikmalaya."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Good hotel in town","Stay at the hotel in early November to attend my cousin wedding in town. Have some families in town but want to try staying at the hotel. Fast check in, quite large room for deluxe, however the raining shower is not in its optimum usage. Breakfast variants quite good and they have tasty nasi tutug oncom and bakwan"
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Always be My Best Hotel","For several times, i choose this hotel for staying at Tasikmalaya. Clean, nice, and the hospitality of the employees are never change. Awesome. And now, i found one more positif thing : After check-in , the front office called my room, and asked if there is something i need, the room is it ok, an is there a minor?? Wow, Santika-Tasikmalaya keep the best things."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","The Best Hotel In Tasikmalaya","Tasikmalaya is such a small city and therefore Santika hotel is the best option for staying in this city. I do not think that there are other hotels better than Santika in Tasikmalaya.The property were new and fresh with modern design. It felt comfortable when first stepping in the lobby area and greeted by the hotel staffs. They were very nice and very welcoming. it was indeed a plus point.The room was fine. I took the superior room and stayed there for a night for a business trip. It was sufficient space and cozy for a single business traveller like me. All tools in the room were working just perfect. The bathroom was a bit small and a bit dark. Quite standard: wash basin, toilet and rain shower, all were working fine.I did not use the swimming pool and therefore I could not comment on this.The breakfast were great! It has always been a good reputation that this hotel chain have for years. They are expert in providing traditional food on breakfast. I tried room service and also the restaurant outside breakfast. I was not satisfied with the food. I ordered well done steak and they gave me medium rare steak they claimed to be wee done. For me it was really unacceptable as I could not eat rare meat. It was a ruin on the day. Really.Other than the incident on meal, I think this hotel was ok and I certainly will use it again on my next visit to Tasikmalaya."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Nice!","Stayed 1 night with family. Initially, we got a smoking room that was very smelly. But the room boy kindly helped us to change into no smoking room. The room was nice and spacious, we got a room with a swimming pool view. Nice pool, unfortunately, our stay was too short to try the pool. We should stay longer some other time. The breakfast was delicious, our 2 yo son likes the Soto Ayam very much."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","wifi in n out most of d time ","The property is good. cleaness is good, not very clean details but is good enough for tasik. tha staff is friendly. bfast is ok. staff are friendly. the variety of channel list is ok. but the wifi is in n out most of the time. very annoying when we have to keep signing in when we move from our room to lobby or swimming pool. or even when we stay in d room. the connections just suddenly off, so we have to keep signing in."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Nice hotel","We had some family gathering. We love the room and nice breakfast. The staff are friendly, especially all concierge staff!!! When my grandma asked about tasikmalaya, the answer perfectly and make her satisfied, so knowledgeable! I believe that management team will do something about the restroom in the lobby. My grandma using wheelchair, she had no problem when using bathroom inside the room. But when she using restroom in the lobby, its very hard for her, because the size of bathroom is too small for her. Maybe management will add some restroom for someone who has special need"
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Very nice and comfort","Stay 2 nights at hotel santika tasikmalaya and extend for 2 nights more with my lovely family until the end of ramadhan is unforgettable...Very nice and friendly staff, delicious menu sahur breakfast, great location in the middle of tasikmalaya city, near from mesjid agung and others great destination. Thanks Santika Tasikmalaya Nisa/Furkon/Fey"
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","1 night stay sufficent","Booked 3 separate rooms for the family. Checkin was a breeze and all 3 rooms were located on the same floor and near to each other which is always a plus. Rooms were large enough and the room amenities sufficient. Room price was considerably cheap. Stayed for 1 night before moving on. Breakfast was good."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Nice Hotel in Kota Tasik","First time in Tasikmalaya, stayed 3D2N at santika for vacation. Great location, room and service. Excellent. The Hotel near in the city center, Masjid Agung Tasikmalay and Alun-alun Kota Tasik. Easy to anywhere, nice people, good transport and delicious food street. Love It."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Best Hotel in Tasik","here are my review, from my side of story as always..PROS :1. Good Locations : everywhere within reach2. Friendly Staff : Mr. Rusdi help me with ants problem at my room, he decide to switch my room because of that ants, twice!! but thanks for the complimentary food :))3. Good Value for Money4.

Small Gym with only treadmill, static bike and a few barbell..and NO aircon #HOTwould stay there again next time..good job, Santika"
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Good value for money","Stayed there for a night on our way to central java. Newly build hotel with clean room and good bedding quality. They also have driver room with reasonable charge. Good choices of breakfast and service quality is also good.The number of gym equipment is limited but as there are not so many guest utilized this facility, it was not a really bad problem"
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Highly recommended! ","First time in tasikmalaya, stayed one night at santika. There is nothing wrong about the hotel. It is just great. Great location, great room, great services... Excellent breakfast. So many choices and the taste of the food is excellent. Love it!"
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Good","Nice hotel, clean room and bathroom. It was nice to stay here. Too bad i was on transit only hence it quite short time to enjoy the hotel facilities. But overall the stay is nice. I was checked in late at night. Quite long at that time probably because middle of the night. But the hospitality are great."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","The best in town","This hotel is the best 3 star hotel you can get in Tasik. It has great staffs and services, just like any other Santika. The building is new, never worried about the cleanliness. The location is also perfect. There are drugstore, banks and restaurants nearby. It also has swimming pool and simple fitness center."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Good Hotel in Tasikmalaya","The food is delicious, I went there several times for meeting. If you want to see Tasik city from above and need a place to celebrate your moment with candle light dinner, they definitely have the place. Very recommended. Swimming pool also very nice."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Nice Hotel","Best Price, cleanness hotel, near to cullinary place, The all staff is so helpfull and polite.Breakfast menu variatif, there's a small swimming pool and fitness centre. Note : You will have a best price especially in weekend..:)"
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Comfortable Rooms","we greatly helped by the presence of this hotel in the southern part of West Java because our working area which include Ciamis, Tasikmalaya, Banjar to Pangandaran and I think the only good hotel in this area, our rooms were clean and comfortable, free and rapid internet access help us to finish the job properly, and with a variety of food for breakfast become a pleasant thing in the morning"
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Best hotel in south route...","Once a year, at least, i traveled to jogjakarta and eventually commute back to jakarta. i usually take the south route, wates-banyumas-cilacap-tasik-cileunyi-jakarta. And if i feel tired after a long drive, usually due to heavy traffic, in south route i guess Santika Tasikmalaya was the best option.Their position in the middle of jogjakarta-jakarta, slightly nearer to jakarta was quite convinient. If you want other hotel, you can try staying in purwokerto, but it take small detour to get there. We usually get free room upgrade and get a good price at santika. Their room is very clean and their services is a very good. Breakfast was good with many options. It's also within walking distance to many interesting places in tasikmalaya, such as ampera restaurant etc. You should try it sometimes"
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Basic 3 Star Hotel in Tasik Melaya","Spent a night there recently on business. Firstly, was disappointed that my office was only able to pre-pay for the hotel due to complete availability. Second, they couldn't offer me a non-smoking room. Hotel was very new, so the smell was not a problem, but always a let down. Hotel was quiet, but the buffet breakfast was pretty basic, and the room was quite basically furnished... bathroom reminded of a older 80's style plan and gets dated fast. Good for Tasik Melaya and the nightly cost, but nothing I would ever go back personally for."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Beyond my expectations","Initial impression of the hotel was great. Looked very new and well kept from the outside driving in. Its set a little bit behind the main road which was a plus in terms of noise. Staff at the reception area was friendly and helpful. The only thing that they could not provide me was a second card to enter my room. I believe they ran out of cards....... No matter, just a small problem. Room was clean and in much better condition than some hotels I've been in that are rated 4-5 stars. Room service was efficient, food was good and cheap. They serve a typical asian style breakfast. We were there for a wedding so did not have much time to roam the streets. however if you are in need of cash, the ATMs are just next to the hotel which is handy. And if memory serves me well, shops are 2 blocks away. Overall, HIGHLY recommended hotel."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Nice Location","This hotel have agood location in Tasikmalaya. i spent 2 night in this hotel and take deluxe room on 7th floor, the view from the room is swimming pool and tasikmalaya scenery :). The room is big, clean and spacious too. The breakfast menu is standard even with wide varieties, you can try to drink JAMU (Indonesia traditional healthy drink). In Room Service Menu, you can try Pisang Goreng (Fried Banana), i think its recommended lite menu :)"
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Surprisingly Good!","3 star hotel in a small city, santika tasikmalaya is way more that I expected! The hotel is clean, modern, comfortable and well managed. The wifi works 24 hour in my room. The breakfast is varied from traditional to western food. Recommended!"

"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Great hotel in the city","The hotel is very comfortable, clean and the service is good. I was amazed they would still greet you even though you are in the car passing by. I didn't try out the pool since it was only a 1 night stay but i saw a lot of family having great times over there. The breakfast was superb. I was curious about Nasi Tutug Oncom but unable to find it since the city was ""dead"" after 7. I tried it during breakfast along with other foods... great varieties, great taste.... thumbs up for the kitchen staff. Nothing to complain about this hotel for its price, service, comfort. Would come back if i am in town. oh but one thing... no refrigerator in the room"

"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Great Hotel! Very helpful staff. Pool is awesome!","We had a wonderful time at Santika. Upon check-in I casually mentioned that it was my wife's birthday the following day. We were pleasantly surprised at breakfast with a very big birthday cake while the staff sang happy birthday. Thanks Santika Tasikmalaya for making my wife's special day even sweeter."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","The best in Tasikmalaya","I will consider Santika as the best hotel in Tasikmalaya. It has complete facilities including swimming pool (adults and kids), best view on top restaurant. I stayed with family booking 2 connecting rooms. Clean and comfortable rooms. They offered free drink and snack for everyone checking in and guests, it was very good. Checking in is quick as we have booked the room days before and the rate is reasonable even on peak season (long weekend). Rooms are clean and beds are good quality. Although I smell a little bit cigarette smoke when entering the room, which I hate (but I didn't ask for non-smoking floor and didn't bother to ask as the hotel was full and we already got connecting rooms). We have so many TV channels to enjoy in rooms. Swimming pools is nice at the afternoon and quite packed with mostly children and teenagers. At night, there is a food stalls in front of hotel (managed by Santika) which then easy for us to find meal for dinner. Breakfast is standard as other Santika hotel. Good variety of foods to choose. The staffs are the best, they always greet and smile, also refuse any tips which is more appreciated. Definitely will stay here again when I come to Tasikmalaya."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Best in town","Checked in at 11.30 pm, and fortunately they still have available room. I forgot the room type, but the receptionist gave me the best price IDR 750K, include brfast & mini bar (Publish rate IDR 1250K).I dont spent much time here, since at 07.00 am, i should checked out to continue my journey to central java.What i can share about this hotel :- Room is very spacious- Breakfast was great- WiFi was also great- Got newspaper- Nice staffWill back again to this hotel someday"
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Overpriced and terrible","We stayed in the premiere room which was expensive for the area - we were very disappointed that our air conditioning was broken and not fixed despite our constant calls to the Santika team. Indonesia is very hot and this was unbearable. Also window cleaners were outside our room every day for quie sometime peering in so terrible privacy. Terrible banging or building noises at night above us. They advised second night could move but it isn't easy to move a large family. Staff largely so were polite and helpful although a little slow. We wish there was a spa too. We have a business in tasik but would now prefer to stay elsewhere on our frequent vsits"
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","value for money!","this is a value for money hotel....the room rate is fair (the reception said it is even cheaper if we book online), the room is clean and large, plasma tv, free wifi, and breakfast included...the location is in the centre of the city but as you already expected, not many interesting place to visit in this city...."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Spacious room and nice stay.","It is a perfect stop when you are on the long trip from Jakarta to Central Java. It's actually quite luxurious. The room is spacious, there is a big sofa that you can sleep in if you happen to need more bed. :-) There is an overhead plus a flexible shower in the bathroom, so it is great to bathe kids there. Big flat TV. But too bad there is no refrigerator in the room.My disappointment during my stay there was that they use the swimming pool as an area for bazaar or something. Maybe occasionally because apparently there was some kind of seminar at that moment. But still it's very uncomfortable for those guests who wanted to swim like us."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Good Hotel","Good hotel. Its a clean hotel, in a good location & with good facilities. Breakfast is moderate & but overall service was good. My only complain is that the fridge was not available in my room. I recommended for those who planning to stay at the city & would definitely go back"
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","A pleasant stay","I stayed for one night during my return trip from Yogyakarta to Jakarta. Booked two deluxe rooms through their website. The rooms are HUGE but the bathroom is somewhat small. Great location with plenty of foodstalls nearby and hang out places. Tasty breakfast menus."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","The best hotel in town.","I stayed at hotel just for one night and feels like home.. Surrounding so quite, the hotel still new,the room is clean,spacious and well furnished. Air cond and the shower are well operated. the staff so friendly. The pool is not too big but nice .. The Breakfast has a great taste.. Will be back on my next visit to tasikmalaya."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","the best hotel in tasik","a spacious room, clean and hommy. is really worth to try in Tasikmalaya. breakfast is great, with many of choice in local and international menu. this hotel located in the heart of the city. just walk to the center of the town"
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Excellent Hotel - Will Really Come Back...","I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights just few days back n I really had a great time there...The cleanliness, staff, food, room n facilities were just amazing...I recommend everyone going to Tasikmalaya to stay in this hotel n experience the amazing days..."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Good new hotel","Last year I got an invitation from an old friend in Tasikmalaya, he celebrated his wedding day @ Santika Tasik. I decided to stay in that hotel for a night.The hotel was relatively new, so I could smell particular odor all around the hotel (except in the lobby). The price was higher than my usual hotel, but at first I believed it was fair enough considering Santika Tasik was rated as four star hotel. But in my opinion the lobby was too small and the room was too narrow. The good news, the room was still in a perfect condition. They have swimming pool, but I didn't use it. The breakfast was moderate - I wouldn't say it was bad, but too standard for a four star hotel. The location is in the main road, but there is another hotel closer to the city center, which provides the same quality (even cheaper). But Santika has more staffs compared to other hotels I've stayed in, they're very friendly and handful, and more professional. The parking space is in the basement, so it wouldn't get wet when it's raining.Overall, it's a nice hotel for a small town - but it was in ""borderline"" between three and four star."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Homey","Our family spend 2 nights at santika tasikmalaya during lebaran holiday last august. The hotel is brand new, one of the tallest building in tasikmalaya, located in the city area, lots of dining option around.We stayed in deluxe room with extra bed, the space was adequate for 3 adults, 2 children and a baby, i found the housekeeping service was excellent because during our stay there, we called the housekeeper several times to clean our room n change the bed sheets because of my children were pretty sick n they vomitted in the room. The housekeeper came immediately after we called them, thank you very much.The breakfast buffet was hectic because we stayed there during peak season but the staffs were very friendly n helpfull, the food selection was limited but it quite tasty.The only downside that i found during my stay was the lift, it was very slow, it took us forever from lobby to our room on the 6th floor, but it was not a big issue for us.Overall, it was a nice experience, surely will stay here again."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Great Hotel at the heart of Tasikmalaya","Great Hotel at city center of Tasikmalaya. Great price but Quite difficult to find (Closed to Crowded Market)Superior room with pool view, clean and comfort beds.Great service with smile, polite and quick to help us.My son love the swimming pool.various breakfast menu and the taste quite good."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Best Hotel in Tasikmalaya","A hotel in a small city that has comfort room and good view. The food was average, i didnt find any special taste, but it has a great place restaurant on the roof top. The staffs were very friendly, polite and helpfull. Just need to improve the ramp from 1st floor to 2nd floor for parking area, it was too tight to drive, glad i was using small car."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","The best hotel in Tasikmalaya","I really feel cosy and comfort staying in Santika Hotel Tasik and also the food is good. For the staff is very friendly and helpful.Need to improve the parking road from the first floor to the second floor the curve is too dangerous. But anyway I'll always stay in Santika Hotel for my Bistrip."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Nice hotel, great staff","Very nice and new hotel with nice rooms all the modcons. All staff was pleasant, polite and helpfull. The driver of the hotelcar drove me to the railway- and busstation and helped me arrange onward travel. He also drove us to the busstation next day. Both trips were courtesy of the hotel. Good breakfast, with a wide choice of western and Indonesian fare."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Nice, cosy hotel in this small city of Tasikmalaya","Perhaps only business travellers would go to small city of Tasikmalaya in West Java, and surprisingly they have this nice, small, modern hotel. My room was pretty standard, but I find it nice with a very cosy bed. The view to the city with mountains in the background was not bad at all. I also liked it convenient location where you can walk to the nearby shopping areas, restaurants and food stalls (warungs)."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","The best hotel in town","We rent 4 Superior rooms on May 18th - 20th based on the positive reviews we read in tripadvisor. True to previous reviews, the hotel is the best in town. It is a new hotel, just opened late last year so everything looks very clean and immaculate. It's located in the downtown area and the service are great! We were handled very nicely considering we brought a long 4 children along. The facilities are complete for a 3 stars hotel. It has pool, fitness centre, LCD tv, and the breakfast is quite complete with its own eggs stand. We paid only USD 40 per room per night net including breakfast, really worth the price. So next time you have the time to visit the city, highly suggest to stay in the hotel.Btw, book via their website for best price. Don't call directly since we were offered higher price when calling so we just booked via their website (Saved about 20 bucks per room per night!!)"
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","Good hotel","I am so glad, Santika was open here. So, I have more option to choose hotel here. I took standard room, and cost me $45/night. The parking area is spacious, the breakfast was excellent, and the staff were very helpful. I would stay here again if I am visiting Tasikmalaya"
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","The Highest Hotel in Tasikmalaya","No wonder why I told it the highest hotel in town, I get the 5th floor room, and I can see whole city! The premiere room affords you the great experience with the Mt. Galunggung view. The bed, tv, and the bathroom so perfect on this class. Location is in the heart of the town, near to go everywhere. Very recommended to you who want to get a leisure and luxurious experience from the city."
"Ciamis","Hotel Santika Tasikmalaya","4 ","The Right Hotel for family","Newly opened on August 2011, good food and good locationreal value for money.. a walking distance to ""Masjid Agung Tasikmalaya""..Also have a large ballroom for wedding and birthday party..highly recommended"
"Ciamis","Crown Hotel Tasikmalaya","3 ","Very very average. No working wifi in rooms.","This place is definitely not worth the price but is still comfortable. Nice staff. The wifi doesn't actually work in the rooms (barely works at all) and the bathroom desperately needs a massive renovation (very smelly too unfortunately). Overall, it's okay, but I wouldn't stay here again."
"Ciamis","Crown Hotel Tasikmalaya","3 ","Hotel Room","The room price is cheap. It's about IDR 300 K but the room size is little including bathroom. You have nice breakfast in the morning such as fried rice, fried noodle rice, and chicken porridge.The staff is helpful. You can order massage through them.Overall is good."
"Ciamis","Crown Hotel Tasikmalaya","3 ","Old, Bad, Terrible Hotel","I just Come back from Tasikmalaya 2 days ago. I Have Stayed on 28 of august at This Hotel. Since I'm very rare to visit this city so i try to look information on the net and it show this hotel is 3 stars hotel. Since i try to book Santika hotel and it's full already so i try to decide to choose this hotel, since this is 3 stars hotel,others hotel that shown is more lower star or even no star hotel. I Booked the Superior Room, the price is Rp. 490.000 which is the 2nd From the Most expensive Room Which is Deluxe. I think it will be nice hotel and good room.Soon when i Arrive at this hotel, look nice hotel with good reception and fast check in. My Room Number is 123, the key is a standard key which still use Key it self. Soon i go to my room, from the naked eye the room look nice n clean even the AC still the old style model without remote and the television in my room have broken remote. Not a good beginning right? haha..and it is more are coming when i lay in the bed.. The bed is realy unconvinient because the bed is Fell Down and you will not want to have this kind of bed in your room. The Toilet looks Clean, but after i do some observation the toilet bowl is not well maintain, guess what.. i found some Big Red Ant arround the bowl and the floor of the toilet.. Really disgusting and feel want to check out as soon as possible."
"Ciamis","Crown Hotel Tasikmalaya","3 ","Old Hotel Property","Been traveling to Tasikmalaya to visit friend's wedding, the staff's are friendly and polite, very helpful especially when we needed directions in this area, wifi is ok. That being said, the hotel is old and in need for renovation especially in the toilet and shower room, toilet bowl is not in good condition...looked like its never been maintained in quite a while. overall is ok, i think its a bit too pricy for the superior room rented"
"Ciamis","Crown Hotel Tasikmalaya","3 ","Great Tasikmalaya Old Style Hotel","First impression when i arrived in Crown hotel was breathtaking because i impressed that the old style hotel was existing in Tasikmalaya region nowdays. This hotel looked like a hostel in the first floor or maybe like boarding house. I booked the deluxe room (as i known, it's a deluxe), When i opened the door. It was a three star hotel but still in old style and maybe they skipped the renovation to keep it unique. I liked the Television because it still the gorgeous big CRT tv :D. One thing that surprised me was the bathroom because it wasn't very clean and i'm not brave enough to use the bathtub. The water was not very well, i can't burst well so it took time to have a shower from that spout. The breakfast was delicious but... I am a traveller who always stay at 2 or above hotel, not a hostel. For the first time in my life, i have to ASK the waiter for the omelet or the scramble because there was no sign or booth that serve that food. Overall the breakfast was so-so and nothing special. But one of the interesing thing when i stayed at this hotel was i able to experience the past when my parents era still existed. Haha"
"Ciamis","Crown Hotel Tasikmalaya","3 ","Good hotel ","Wifi was ok in the room . Clean hotel . Friendly and helpfull staff . Good location . Food at the restaurant. was ok ,but nothing special . Breakfast was pover. Nice room . Also good entertaining. example ; music band. "
"Ciamis","Crown Hotel Tasikmalaya","3 ","The price is too expensive","I often travell to Tasikmala, and every time I ask to the hotel receptionist, they always offer me the expensive room, the strange is, when you look in the parking area, you will not see lot of car there"
"Ciamis","Crown Hotel Tasikmalaya","3 ","Not very nice, but might be the best in the city","might have the best rooms in its city, but not very recommended. The cleaning service is not good."
"Ciamis","Crown Hotel Tasikmalaya","3 ","Nightmare hotels at Tasikmalaya","Noissy, especially fr 22.00 to 0.30, the food was terrible, I recomend you to chose another hotels"
"Ciamis","Crown Hotel Tasikmalaya","3 ","Only stay if you can sleep with a lot of noise","Myself and my 3 children stayed here overnight twice, en route and return from Pangandaran to Bandung and back in order to break the 6 hour drive in half. Bad idea. No sleep.The rooms themselves appear fine, in fact the Superior triple ( 3 single beds) and Superior ( 1 queen plus a single )are both huge and the staff were more than happy to throw down an extra mattress on the floor. The air con worked fine and there was hot water - my two main criteria in Java. 3 star it certainly is by appearances. The price is absolutely outrageous for a small town stopover with little infrastructure in Java though, I paid around USD $ 70 which seems low by global standards, but trust me, in the middle of West Java, that's just ridiculous. I might also make mention of the shower cap I pulled out of it's teeny tiny resealable plastic bag to find it was already wet and soapy. Eww. But I guess somebody went to a lot of trouble to pack that sucker in.The good news for food is the restaurant is great for dinner and cheap as chips. Breakfast is included and is Indonesian style,basic nasi goreng and condiments, and surprisingly, a man making eggs to order alongside the buffet table. The thing is though, Indonesians all smoke during meals. Heavily. It was tough to see the food under the smoke cloud and really puts you off your food. We couldn't escape breakfast fast enough and unfortunately, your choices are pretty much limited to the hotel or a dodgy street stall where they rinse your dish in a bucket of filthy water.But the noise was phenomenal. The first night we were there we were backed up against the restaurant/cafe. Seemed OK as there was no-one else at dinner and we thought we had it all to ourselves. Wrong! At 10pm,(and this was a Tuesday) the band started in the cafe. Until 1am. Then, my daughter was treated to a generator behind her headboard until 6am. It seemed, according to the manager whose chest was puffed out in pride at my noise complaint, that the Crown hotel is THE place to karaoke. Every night. So, I thought, well I will just book a room on the other side of the hotel for the return trip. Well that was foiled by the conference being held there. I am not kidding, they were like college kids on spring break, yelling and running in the hallways, slamming doors and at one point, playing cards with a boombox on the floor right outside my door.And when I say it did not stop, I am not exaggerating. At 6am after nearly 12 hours of this with repeated calls to the front desk ( who did not come) I finally lost my temper and flung the door open and yelled at the lot of them, who all just kind of ignored me. We were so tired we could barely drag ourselves to the car to get out of Dodge. Part of the problem is the style of the door, with a large, uncurtained glass partition above it ( probably for extra light) but what a sound funnel.So, if you are travelling through Java, avoid this one unless you are a heavy sleeper, head on straight through to Pangandaran or Bandung and hang the extra couple of travelling hours."
