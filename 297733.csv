","Very average","I was recommended the Dive shop by a friend of a dive buddy, so for convenience I thought I would stay at the attached resort. It was OK but nothing spectacular.The arrangements were made through the Sales team online and Chloe was quite efficient. I did not receive a voucher,m as I had been told I would, so I emailed across and Oceane was quite quick to respond.That was basically the end of the service from the hotel.I was supposed to be collected at 10am from my hotel on Bali for a transfer to Gili Air, this was reserved and paid for through the package I purchased. When the transfer did not arrive I called the transfer company, they said nothing had been booked. I then called the hotel. The hotel said it had been booked. That was it. The guy on the phone would/could not understand that the transfer company was saying there was not booking. He did not offer to call the transfer company, just kept saying that a booking had been made. This was quite frustrating as there was no offer of assistance from him, just ""it has been booked"". Then why did they not pick me up!! Finally with the help of the staff in Bali I was able to arrange my transfer.I arrived on the island and found my way to the hotel. I did not see any signs pointing to the hotel from the Jetty, which might be useful to other guests. Although it was not specified in my package a meet and greet would be nice - especially when the hotel knows you are arriving. Some of the other hotels did this and I thought it was nice. I arrived at the hotel and greeted. I expected to settle the bill on arrival and I was informed by the lady that the Credit Card machine was not working so I had to pay cash. Ummmm..no I did not have or want to have that much cash. After she insisted again and I refused she said that maybe the machine in the Dive Shop was working, so we walked over and I settled there. It certainly did appear to be an effort for the staff member.I was shown to my room, bag was dumped and that was about it. The porter did not really explain anything about the room, but maybe he picked up that I was tired.The rest of the stay was just Blah. Nothing of note but nothing spectacular either.I did not eat in the restaurant except for breakfast as it did not appear to be very inviting, there was either VERY high seating at the bar or the couch type seating facing the ocean. I did not see a normal table and chair anywhere.The last comment I have is about the lack of communication between each department at the resort, 2 weeks prior to my arrival I emailed to say that my traveling companion was not able to come. OK, I was within the cancellation period so I have to pay. I did pay so no huge quibble there but 14 days in advance is a bit on the strict side, especially in shoulder season. It was not so much the paying but the fact that this information was not passed along to ANYONE in the chain. The transfer company (after finally being sorted) was expecting 2 people, reception was still expecting 2 people and the fact that I had specifically booked in for certain days for diving was also not passed onto the dive shop. This was the most frustrating part of my trip.Overall it was just Blah. I do plan on returning to Gili Air as I loved the atmosphere and the relaxing feel of the island but I think I'll look for another place to stay and just dive with 7seas."

","The dormitory smelled really mouldy and the restaurant often run out of things but people were friendly and helpful.","Free tea and coffee at certain times were a nice add-on.The pool was nice. Wifi a bit unstable, especially for iPhones. That was a bit annoying. Pool looked nice.Restaurant area and cottages were nice too.Some more flowers would be great"

","Nice holiday at 7Seas Cottages","I spent, with my friend, 5 nights at 7Seas Cottages and was very happy to be there. The staff is very nice and helpful. Good choice of breakfast. Very well located at Gili Air, easy to go everywhere on foot or bicycle. The room was clean, comfortable, air conditioning working well. I enjoy the private entrance to my room. Thank to all the staff and a special thank to Aziz.Pauline P."

","Keep your expectations LOW and youll be ok","Nothing REALLY bad but would NOT recommend. Paid Â£45 / USD 66 a night & expected moreROOM- Deluxe Villa - disappointed it was right on the road - photos were misleading.- large but basic - aircon was poor - very dark. - power was constantly going off (so aircon shut down, required someone to turn back on - annoying in the night!). I complained & they tried to tell me it was the govt however all their neighbours had power whilst ours was out- Bathroom nice but no shower head and hot water was very unreliableRESTAURANT:- Staff nice, but over attentive & orders delivered incorrectly- ice bucket for drinks was disgusting - never been washed.- Breakfast disappointingSERVICE:- Overall staff were nice but ineffective and poorly trained- Lack of manager on duty and the place wreaked of poor management.- Staff ignored our 'privacy' sign on the door, to delivery us an incredibly annoying letter seeking to absolve themselves from the huge party that was about to happen in the restuarant next door. Not their fault, but a poor way to handle the matter and they should respect the privacy sign- Any issue reported to the front desk was met with a blank expression, and in one or two cases just the word 'NO'Gili Air was my least favourite of the 3 islands... if you want chilled and quiet go to Meno, if you want something a bit more lively (but still pretty chilled and quiet) go to T.

","Decent dorms and great location","The hostel was close to the restaurants, laundry, scuba activities, bike rentals, and the harbor. We really liked the pool area, it was nice to cool down as the heat was a bit too much on the island. The dorm room had good beds, but there was no AC. It was so hot inside the room that after we put on sunblock we had to stand right in front of the fans so we wouldn't just sweat it all off. I think it was hotter in the room than outside in the shades but we managed. Nevertheless we slept really well and we liked the showers. The wifi worked well and the staff was friendly :)"

","Cozy cottage, great location!","Stayed here while diving with 7 Seas in December, and were allocated to a cottage near the street, dive centre and pool. So it was really convenient for us to return in between dives. Dining options along the street were plenty. Our Favourite was chill out bar with great local food, fresh bbq seafood and fish steaks, and icecream.The hotel also recommended a bike shop called Cha Cha for bike rental and it was good. Be sure to bring your own torch or charge up your smart phone for the torch light function if you're Cycling at night as it seems that dynamos on the bike don't work and there are limited street lights at night.Room was spacious, toilet was huge. Cleanliness was okay, but could have been better. There was a outdoor tap and balcony for us to wash and dry our dive gear which we appreciated.Staff at the reception were great! Friendly, helpful and very welcoming. Special kudos to Audi (not sure if I got his name right) who was very pleasant and spoke very well.Thank you for the stay!"

","Standard Rooms, not bungalows?!?","I thought I would stay in Bungalows but this was just regular rooms with a nice balcony though. The cleaning wasn't perfect though. When we came to the room it was water in the bathroom. The floor doesn't lean towards the rinsing hole so there is always water near the toilet of ours. really frustrating since your pants will get wet overtime you want to go to the bathroom if you don't hold them up when you sit. The restaurant provides really great breakfast and lunch/dinner. Good variation and mostly really good food. Service was good but sometimes really slow. They would need to shape up a bit with costumer awareness. The entrance to all the rooms in the back has a view to another hotel. Next to that there was a lot of trash behind a fence, disgusting! Every monday there is a huge party on a nearby restaurants. It's impossible to sleep that day even with earplugs and I had to cancel my diving trip since I couldn't get sleep until they stopped around 4 in the morning (which i was told was earlier than its used to)"

","Stayed in an ensuing room not a bungalow","This was a basic room with a nice ensuite and a balcony. Hot water was constant which isn't a rule on the island so was a bonus.I think it was expensive for what it is but I couldn't get them toco e down any further on price.My stay was ok. Location was handy. Room was cleaned daily"

","Don't bother","Ridiculously overpriced deluxe room. Light too dim to see at night. Aircon inefficient. 1 sheet on bed no other covers. Dirty old towels. No glasses, tea, coffee. Toilet loose from floor. Shower a plastic cut off pipe that missed the shower and shot a single stream into middle of bathroom. Run down and dingy room and bathroom. Pool ugly and gardens and pool area messy and run down. Opposite noisy restaurant. Staff unfriendly and unknowledgeable. For $80 in off season i'd expect much more. Moved after 1 night to a beautiful friendly beach front place a few minutes away with lovely pool for $50 a night."

","Beautiful bungalow","I recently stayed in a bungalow on Gili Air. The bungalow was beautiful, very private and comfortable. It had a beach view, outdoor space (couch as was as a table), comfortable bed, armoire, tons of space to unpack and organize, a refrigerator, desk, wifi and an amazingly large open bathroom. The location is close to everything and the restaurant had great food. Wonderful staff that accommodated every request and kept the place spotless. I hope to stay here again!"

","(Only) Good Location","Once you are arrived in Gili Air harbour just go to the left and walk around 3 minutes you will arrived on the hotel. The reception on your left side and the dive center on your right side. Location is the best for this hotel, near ATM, restaurants (they even have their own restaurant : Green Cafe), harbour, etc.We were stay in dorm room, we choose double bed dorm room, it was extremely hot room when we slept in the afternoon after diving and before my sunset dive. i barely can sleep with this heat! then i decided go outside, have some air since i cant handle the heat anymore!The cleanliness of the dorm shared bathroom was poor. Many paper toilet in the bathroom and dirty closet from unresponsible guests!if you stay on dorm room they don't provide breakfast but you can find restaurants near the hotel."

","Good value for money","Being it's the cheapest hostel in Gili Air with a swimming pool, it is good value. Great proximity to the beach and the pool was nice, good shady spot too with deck chairs. The rooms do get exceptionally hot, so if you can't sleep in the heat I wouldn't recommend it. I just ditched the sheet and slept fine. The rooms are so clean, sheets changed daily. The bathrooms are beyond basic and falling apart - toilet seats falling off and rarely looked clean. Staff weren't rude, just had that laid back Gili attitude of indifference! WiFi was strong in all areas. Don't expect too much and you'll be ok, especially for island prices. I enjoyed my stay :)"

","Doesn't live up to Western standards","Got a room here in the main part of the hotel (i.e. not a separate cottage). On the plus side, the bedroom area and the balcony are nicely designed. The bed was comfortable. The downsides:1. The air conditioning was not functioning properly when we checked in. We reported the issue and they made some adjustments so it worked somewhat better2. There were no hand towels or hand soap in the bathroom. No shampoo provided. There was an on-wall body wash dispenser that had a fly in it. The bathroom floor was constantly wet due to the air conditioning duct leaking water near the toilet (this is how the setup was designed).3. A very thin blanket was provided on the bed - we asked but they didn't have anything heavier4. No hair dryer available5. The included breakfast does not include water. On the day we were leaving, we ordered breakfasts for the two of us, but they brought only one. We had to ask twice for the omitted second breakfast. About 10 minutes after the second request, they informed us that our desired breakfast was all out. By that time, we had been at their restaurant for nearly an hour, and we had to leave in order to catch our boat. Since we were not able to eat one of the breakfasts that we had paid for with the room, I suggested they could comp the bottle of water and call it even. They refused to do that, charging the full price for a few sips of water and providing no refund for the meal that they didn't serve.This was my first time staying on Gili Air, so maybe this is the kind of quality and service that should be expected. Hopefully this experience is atypical though."

","Dorm rooms","If you book a 140.000 bed in there, it's a double bed on an upper bunk. They should mention this when you book it I think. The rooms are very hot at the end of the afternoon and on the upper level it is almost unbearable. There is a fan but that didn't help a while lot. Shower were pretty dirty and most of the toilets could use a re-fitting/ upgrade. Location is great, 10m from the beach."

","Good for relaxing ","Really relaxing place, good view, good for couples and family, room was ok and clean, staff in reception he was nice and friendly but staff in the restorant / bar they are not friendly and not smiling, they are to busy talking in the morning when i asked for breakfast menu. Not really helpful."

","Good price in share room","I stayed in a share room, in a double bed. It hadn't A/C, only two flats in the room but it was ok. You only share the room with 2 or 3 people and it's a nice place in great location, close to the ferry station and a beautiful beach with very good restaurants. You can snorkeling very close to the hostel. The pool it's good, quiet, actually the entire hostel it's quiet, no parties on it. The bathroom is share but i see people cleaning like twice a day.It's good because there are private rooms (cottages) or shared."

","Excellent","Good place, good company, good personal,etc In general it is a perfect place to go.It's location is really near the ferry port.The restaurant associated to 7seas is not the best option... but the Hotel is perfect. Moreover, you can not find nothing cheaper on Gili Air."

","Good room, very noisy music to 3 am in morning","We stayed in a superior twin room (2) as no double rooms were available. It was a ground floor room in the building just behind reception. These seemed much better than the upper storey rooms. This worked out well as we were a little further back from the main path, But this hotel is next to Paradiso Bar where they had a party on Sunday night which Was extremely loud , we could hear the music until 3 am in the morning. Some of the cottages are right on the path and many people walk past at nights.Our room was basic but clean with two twin beds, with an enclosed courtyard, very good air con and a nice bathroom. We arrived and booked in around 11.30 am and was told to go with one of their staff members. We thought we were being shown to our room, but were taken to their luggage storage room. Check in was 2 pm. At about 1.30 we went back to enquiry if the room was ready and was again told that check in was not until 2 pm.The breakfast was tasty and simple in the restaurant on the sea front. A dive school is attached to the hotel And they use the pool most of the day, The wifi works well in the lobby (where there are seats and tables) but not in our room. It's also really close to the boats (2 minutes) and to the village so the location to be convenient and central. . Overall definitely not the fanciest on the island but ok, however we moved as the noise from the Paradiso Bar was unbearable."

","Worst service ever at their cafÃ© bar","After a morning of snorkelling we were looking for a nice place to eat and who accepts visa as atm's were down , we ended up there as the view was beautiful. 5mins after having finished our lunch they pushed us to order more, then proposed us to bring the order ( restaurant was empty). we then have been asked how much we pay in our hotel and told that we can't pay with visa anymore... Do not recommend it at all !!!"

","Good location, but is was the only good thing","Given the price of this Hotel, and the pictures found on the Hotel website, you expect to stay in paradise...well...this is not the case!Location is good, since the hotel is just 100meters from the harbor and close to the sea, but, the rest has not met our expectations.We booked a family cottage that, when we arrived at 2pm, tired because of the long travel, wasn't ready yet. They have told us to wait only 10 minutes that the room would have been ready, while we had to wait more than 1 hour.To pay the room, they haven't accepted credit card since their terminal was broken, and, instead of waiting and let us pay the stay in the next days, they told us to withdrawal money (we had to withdraw 4 times thus paying 20â¬ of commissions) in order to pay at the moment.After that, we moved to the cottage, which was not as pictures display. Fairly dirty, dark and with a toilet that is in pretty bad conditions.But here the real issue, a part from a couple of individual, is the staff. A lot of employees but few of them are effectively active, helpful and kind.I think that it is possible to find better place to stay at that high prices."

","Oh dear..","Checked into this hotel for a three night stay on Gili Air.Booked a delux cottage which unbeknownst to the wife and I was street side and attracted a great deal of noise. Cottages are old, dark and in need of a proper cleaning. Clearly, ownership, is not on site and looking for a healthy ROI from this property.The first cottage was next to a construction site and a request to move to a somewhat quieter one was granted. This one was marginally quieter but the roof was rat infested with the little ones climbing over the roof in the evening and early am. Reports from those staying in the backpacker accommodations was that rats occupy the communial toilets and need to be evicted by staff when a boarder needs to use. Not hygienic in the least.one other key note: even though the tap water is undrinkable the hotel charges for a bottle of water at the inflated rate. Pool area is filthy with little shade and cushions that have stains of unknown substances on them. the deluxe accommodations are overpriced for the quality.Good accommodation for the backpacker who is a animal lover but not for the average tourist.Give it a pass, there are many other better choices on the island."

","Excellent place to hang out ","I really liked this place, the staff were super friendly especially Aldi from lombok. The dorm was clean and specious with locker. My fan was not so good but they changed it for a new one once I told them. The bed was made regularly and the facilities are clean. The place is five minutes from the harbour and very convenient to everything. The beach is opposite. There is a pool and book before you come as the dorm is mostly full. I stayed an extra night making it five"

","Cheap and cheerful (maybe be tactical about rooms to avoid noise)","We stayed in a superior double room (11) and had a upstairs room in the building just behind reception. This worked out well as we were a little further back from the main path, and not right next to Paradiso Bar where they had a party on Monday night which I think would have been pretty loud if you were at the other end - we could hear the music but it wasn't much of a problem. Other nights were totally quiet. Some of the cottages are right on the path so I think some of them might be a bit louder with people walking past etc, so to avoid that maybe ask for one further back?Our room was basic but clean with a comfy bed, handy balcony with a little bit of sea view, very good air con and a nice bathroom. The staff were friendly and we found the breakfast tasty and simple (we always had toast as were diving and eating too much then squishing into a wetsuit never works well for me!). The dive school attached is good. I think they use the pool most of the day, but in the evening it's probably free - the sea is mega close though - the best swimming nearby is if you walk round a bit to near Scallywags restaurant, it shelves a bit more quickly there and there's nice snorkelling - probably a 3 minute walk. The wifi works well in the lobby (where there are seats and tables) but was a bit patchy in our room. It's also really close to the boats (2 minutes) and to the village and sunset west coast strip (10 -15 mins), as well as being on the main south east coast strip, so we found the location to be really convenient and central. . Overall definitely not the fanciest on the island but a good balance of location, price, and quality for us."

","WARNING! Peeping Toms","During my stay at the very average 7Seas Cottages, I had somebody crawl up the wall of my shower and peek over at me - when I went around the back part of the building to inspect the area, I noticed you could only access the back of the building via the lobby of the hotel, which leads me to believe that this could possibly have been an employee. Presumptuous, I know. Either way, cover yourself!Also, my bathroom smelled like a sewerage. For $50AUD a night, I expected more."

","OK place, but better options available","We booked into a deluxe cottage at 7 Seas for a two-week stay in August. The cottage was nice enough with effective air conditioning and a good breakfast. However, the location is not very good - it's on the main drag right near the port, and we found it noisy throughout the night with music and people congregating and talking loudly right outside our gate near a restaurant entrance. Not really the hotel's fault, but we were looking for a more peaceful experience. We checked out of 7 Seas after 5 days and moved to a place on the opposite end of the island that provided almost identical accommodation but was far quieter -- and cost less than half as much per night. So: this place is okay, nothing wrong with it really, but there are better options available on the island in my opinion."

","Nice accommodation, comfortable","We tried the superior double rooms and the cottages. Both are very clean and comfortable, right by the beach and the diving center, with powerful AC.

","Cosy, Clean, comfortable and CHEAP!!!!","As I was going to be staying on Gili Air for one month I needed a relatively cheap place to stay which was also clean and cosy and this place ticked all three boxes. I stayed in the dorm which was small yet comfortable with 2 single beds and a double bed and you have plenty of room to put your belongings on the table, floor or locker. Thereâs free wifi at this hostel which is easily accessible and the wifi codes can be collected from reception anytime. The staff were really friendly and always said hello and smiled which was lovely after staying there for one month. On my last night I had to move to another hostel which didnât even compare...I was sad I couldnât spend my last night on the island at 7 seas backpacker as it was such a great little hostel. The only thing I would say is that it can be very loud when there are parties so if you are a light sleeper this probably is not the place for you! I know when I was leaving the chief of the island was trying to clamp down on the parties (Go to Gili T for nights out) so you never know, this problem may be no more by the time you get there!!I hope to return to Gili Air next summer again and I will definitely be staying in the dorm again!P.S if you drink in the âGarden Cafeâ opposite buy a âDark Knightâ cocktail.....Absolutely delicious!"

","Lovely place but anti social hostel ","I'm a solo traveller who has just spent 2 nights in Kuta Lombok which although beautiful there are no hostels so I got a bit bored of talking to myself. I was very much looking forward to being back in a friendly hostel where I could meet people again, unfortunately that wasn't the case. Although 7seas has a number of 'backpackers dorm room' all of them are only 4 bed and really they are 3 bed because it's 2 singles and 1 double, there is a pool & the reception area has tables but no lounge area for backpackers to meet. I was unlucky and was put in a room with a couple who were enjoying a romantic break from backpacking and enjoying peaceful Gili air. 7seas is a big place with other private rooms too so their cafe across the road and beach loungers were often taken up by older couples and families. The place is lovely and clean with excellent wifi so I would definitely recommend this place if you're travelling with friends but I don't think it's well suited to solo travellers because of the lack of communal area and vibe."

","Very Disappointing","I was truly disappointed in my stay at 7Seas. The cottage is located directly on the main path around gili air so it was only a thin fence between me and everyone else. The place was noisy too, music at night and not nearly as relaxing as they lead me to believe. Their website boasts quiet peace and relaxation but none of those things are really true. When I confronted their staff about this they told me it wasnt their fault and were very dismissive of my complaints. I walked around all of gili and saw many nicer and quieter options. If I return I will not be staying at 7Seas again. If you want good staff who listen to you and a quiet and relaxing atmosphere I urge you to look elsewhere. 7Seas is a really disappointing place."

","Friendly staff, good value hostel","Stayed in the hostel rather than the cottages, but had a really good experience. The 'dorm rooms' are more like family rooms, with only 4 people in each. The facilities are basic but clean and the beds are comfortable.The staff are really friendly and incredibly helpful, and although there are late night parties nearby, I didn't find these a problem as I can sleep through anything. Maybe take some earplugs if you're not a heavy sleeper.We had a minor issue on one evening and the staff were incredibly helpful and the owner/manager was deeply apologetic and considerate in trying to compensate.I had a wonderful stay compared to other hostels on Gili Air, and would definitely visit again."

","Great Experience... And then...","I'm going to try my best to be fair and impartial here. Because, for the first two days of our stay 7 Seas was really nice. The staff were friendly, the room was clean and comfortable and really everything was pretty good. And then... On our second day we received a highly unprofessional note on our door basically saying ""Hey, so, we're having this party because we care about making money off drunk partiers way more than about the comfort of our guests. And, too bad that you paid A LOT of money for this room and expected peace and quiet. We're not responsible for the noise coming from OUR OWN PARTY."" Needless to say, this chased us right out of this poor excuse for a hotel. There is something SO dishonest and deceptive about this. I see 7 Seas as nothing more than a money-grab. They want want to make as much as they can as quickly as they can. So, they attempt to be some kind of nightclub and hotel all rolled into one, and it's ridiculous.There are plenty of much nicer and cheaper places on Gili Air with honest management who actually care about the guest experience. Just look elsewhere, because 7 Seas is a joke."

","Nightmare","They ruined our stay on Gili Air. We had booked 4 nights and unfortunately, we had payed in advance. Each Monday night, there is an open air disco right next to the hotel and we did not sleep until 04:00 am. For the next night, the hotel announced the 7seas anniversary party ""until sunrise"" with ""excessive sound levels"", in the hotel's own bar just next to our bungalow. When we checked out as we would not pass two subsequent nights without sleeping, the hotel refused to refund our money as they said that 7seas Cottages is not liable for the discomfort caused by the 7seas anniversary party. Are you kidding me? Long story short: if you prefer sleeping over partying, don't stay there on Mondays. If it's Augst, check for the date of the Anniversary party! Or even better: choose another hotel in the first place."

","Don't book on a Tuesday!!!","We originally wanted a cheap double room but they could only offer us a deluxe suite. Well...it came to around Â£50 a night but the room was amazing. Just be careful you book exactly what you want as I we got ripped off a bit as they said all the cheaper double rooms were gone but I'm not sure that was the truth. Secondly....every Tuesday night there is a incredibly loud disco 'beach party' literally opposite our hotel room. I'm not a square and really enjoy partying but this was horrendous music until 4am...unfortunately my other half had food poisoning at the time so I'm coming from the angle of wanting a peaceful sleep but neither of us slept that night until after 4, absolutely ridiculous!"

","Central and Comfortable","Enjoyed our stay at 7seas cottages. it was an easy walk from boat terminal and central to cafes. Huge bathroom and comfy room with verandah.Didn't use the pool as Diving Classes were there. Breakfast was included and pleasant sitting under cabana or in cafe on beach. Refills of water bottles as expensive as buying new, but good for environment."

Price is reasonable but thats about all. Breakfast very average and options not great. Service poor in the restuarant and staff could not cope when more than a few people arrive.

","Not bad at all for being a one star hotel","This is my first time staying at a property with only one star. We booked it because there wasn't much availability on the island. My expectations where low as this is not a place I would choose if I had many other options, but I was pleasently surprised.Rating this property four ot of five is based on what I think other properties in the same category are like, compairing it to that and not that I think it's a four star property. There are room for improvement.Big plus'es - the place is very cheap and the location is good!The guys in the reception where super nice and polite when ever we had anything to do with them. The service in the restaurant is inconsistant. Sometimes you get the servers attention and what you order fast, sometimes it takes forever. That said, after having visited all the Gilis and stayed on the islands for a few weeks my experience is that the latter seems to be the Gili way of service level in most places and you just have to learn to accept it for what it is - or you will spend a lot of time being annoyed which is no way to spend a vacation.It was just me and my son, but since the only bungalow that was available was a family bungalow that was what we booked. It might be a typical Gili house, but to me it was a bit unpractical. We stayed in the upstairs bedroom as that was the best and to get to the bathroom you had to lock your self out of the room, walk down the outside stairs and lock your self into the bathroom as the only thing keeping other people out is the garden gate with no lock. If you have to ""go"" in the middle of the night this not very practical as you also have to get dressed.The bed was not half bad, I have slept in much worse beds in higher classified hotels. The bedlinen was clean and the bathroom too, but it was very dated. Also, the whole bungalow could do with a big scrub down or even better a complete updating.All in all, better than what I expected from a one star property. Would I stay at a one star resort again, probably not."

","Super Comfortable","despite some reviews about it being too hot at night, I think the dorms were perfect. Nights aren't too hot so there was no need for AC. Each bunk also has a fan facing them so that was enough. Everything else was great too, the bathrooms clean, the bedrooms were cleaned every morning. The only thing was that the showers would flood a bit but that wasn't too big of a problem. You're on an island so I don't think you'll be spending much time in the dorms anyway. The location is perfect perfect. Not at all far from the harbor and in the center of all the good places to eat. It was a good place for a great price !"

Only 80.000 per person a night.Clean rooms og nice decor.However we booked three people together many months prior, and when we got here they claimed they couldnt put us in the same room. They also wouldnt move us together during our 5 night stay, even though it seemed possible with other people checking in and out. So that was a bit sad.Also the toilets flood all the time, so constantly dirty water on the floors in the bathrooms. A little bit nasty when you arent suppose to wear shoes inside."

It includes free breakfast so it was a very good stay for us. Although the wifi is a bit on/off but the dive and our stay there was awesome.

The bathroom is huge and again very clean. There are little yards full of shade to sit outside on. However, the noise at night kept me awake. The Walsall are thin, and ventilation is a architectural gap in the bathroom. So the music that on one night was so loud comes through. You can hear people talking and laughing as if they are in your room. It goes quite at around 12:30 so if you can stand that it's perfect."

","Really good stay","Firstly it's very important to differentiate between the hostel side, and the bungalow side. They are basically two different establishments- hence the mixed reviews which really confused us when we were researching it! The bungalows are great!! We stayed in a family cottage, which had two separate rooms, simple, but very comfortable, with one shared (very big) bathroom. The upstairs rooms are really nice, with a bit of a sea view, and the bathroom is really beautiful! The position is great, close to harbour, but not right on top of it, and close enough to the bustling part of The island, without being too busy in front of the bungalows. For a family bungalow it's about 1000K per night which is 500 per room, and in that price bracket on the island it's pretty good value (we looked around). Down side: the swimming in front is not the best, and the restaurant is overpriced (but the breakfast which is included is very generous!)"

","Relaxing and sounds of sea","We haven't booked any hotel before arriving. Just walked trough Gili Airs ""main street"" (just next to the sea). 7 Seas Cottages looked warm and relaxed place to stay with reasonable deal for 7 nights. So we went there and booked own cottage/bungalow. Ours was just opposite ocean and restaurant. This is quite big hotel complex in this tiny island, in the same yard they have hostel, cottages, hotel, restaurant, pool, shops, diving etc. Location is perfect. Everything u need is close and u can found local food or restaurants, hire a bike or trying other water sports like diving, SUP etc. You can walk around the island just in one hour and found couple more places to stop there. Cottage was quite big, old fashioned, but relaxing atmosphere were there all the time. I did love spent time in our own terrace and just across the wall was street, then restaurant and sea. They do have great places to eat, drink and enjoy the views to Lombok in that restaurant. Staff of this restaurant was really nice people. Otherwise staff in Cottages wasn't so nice when u needed something. One night our key just stuck in the lock. And this happened just when we but the key to lock and it didn't work anymore. We didn't do anything violent, it just stuck. Staff came next morning and they did do everything, but nothing happened. So, we just trusted that every one in island is reliable and just left our stuffs there. Second day some guy did fix that door. They do have small locker in that room too, and thats plus. They offer wifi, but its not working so well all the time. Im thinking that is not so bad thing, because we were there relaxing and enjoying life, not spending our time via online. And u must remember that Gili Air is small island which have been growing up so much lately. We really enjoyed our time there and wanted to stay longer. Such a perfect place and people."

There is no air conditioning though so nights are relatively hot. Bathrooms are clean though. So if you don't have a very high standard and you're traveling on a budget, then this hostel is just great! I would stay there again!

","Good for the price","This is one of the cheapest hostels we have stayed in so far in the Gilis. Our first night in the double bed, which is situated at the top of the room, was a horrendous night. Hardly slept because it was too hot. The only fan we had didn't work. We changed to the bunk beds the following day, and these were much better. We had 3 working fans so kept the room really cool. The toilets and showers aren't the best, but for 70,000 IDR a night, you can't complain. Really enjoyed Gili Air, one of the best places we went to. Definitely visit if you have a few spare days in Bali/Longbok. It's a mixture between Gili Trawangan and Gili Mino, it's slightly touristy but is quiet with beautiful beaches and very cheap scuba diving."

The location is great, two minutes walking from the harbour when you come by boat, two seconds walking from all the restaurants and shops and the beach. The staff is very friendly. I irritated myself on the smell in the room. It was very musty.....like wet clothes who were there for too lang! I wasn't able to undo this by any spray or by ventilating the room a lot! It was really IN the bamboo i think. Rooms get cleaned every day though!! Very large showers, but very oldschool and cold water only.

","Nice staff but amenities need help","Well...I stayed here for 2 months doing my dive master course with 7seas. The hostel had its problems. the rooms did smell a little, I think it was like damp wood. most of the showers were unusable due to the lock not working or the lock being completely missing. the others had light problems that would give a human a seizure if attempting to shower. the staff are really nice and I had a great time. Just got to get in Island mode and accept these things as part of the experience. if people come to a place that hardly has electricity and expect a fancy hotel with all the perks then they are wrong. The staff also thought I was checking out a few times and took all my chargers... took me nearly a week to get them back. my key to my locker also snapped in the locker and they charged me for it. wasn't much but its not nice considering I spent soooo much money on the dive master course."

","For the same price there are better options in Gili Air","I reserved and paid a dorm bed through the internet, a single bunk bed. I arrived a day early, I was told that for the first I would have to stay in a doubled bed in the dorm, for a double price, and then move to the single bed, as all of the single beds were taken. I told them that I would go online and reserve, as the previous night there where about 12 free single beds, and it was low season. Immediately there was a free single bed for the two nights...All the people in the dorm had had the same experience, as the receptionist would tell them it was full so they would have to pay double for the double bed.The password for the internet changes daily.The room was very smelly, one of the diving instructors stayed there one night and she had incense all over the place, so it must be a problem all the time.The rooms are quite dark, as there is a high wall just in front of the rooms.The bathroom doors don't close properly. Once the liquid soap in the sink area finished, there was no more for two days. Maybe for longer, but I found a better place to stay and left 7 Seas!"

","Go somewhere else","This hostel was recommended to me as a ""cheap and comfy catch"" but please don't jump for the price - there's no breakfast included, there's no AC, and I was very glad not to have hit my head on the very ill-constructed bunk bed situation. Also happy I didn't suffocate during the night due to the ABNORMAL stink of the whole room. Don't get me started on the (moldy) showers (whose doors you can't close properly) and try not to fall off the toilet seats - they're not exactly stable. I'm nobody travelling in luxury, I lived in a desert yurt for a month, but this hostel is definitely not worth the money."

","Feels like home","I loved the 7Seas dive-team, these guys are truly amazing! We stayed for a week on Gili Air and from the very first day we became like one big family, diving and hanging out together. The team is international, so guys can speak french, german and even a bit russian! So if you came to Gili Air for a good dive, this dream-team is a main point to choose 7Seas. You can book a dorm or a private bungalow. Some of our new friends who lived in the dorm had problems with the roof during rain. We didn't meet such troubles staying in nice bungalow. Bungalow has its own yard with table and couch, one spacious room with comfy king-size bed, a table, closet, many sockets (enough for 2 constantly demanding recharging iPhones, mosqito repeller and power bank). Shower and toilet are on the back yard with stone wall and skylight between the wall and the roof. Remember that water should be almost fresh, maybe just a bit salty, and if you feel salt don't hesitate contacting the reception. The hotel has really good breakfast, and it's truly precious feeling having your fresh juice or morning coffee laying in gazebo and looking at the sea. The beach line is just the same as in nearly all nearby hotels, not very wide, but clean (hotel service cleans their part of the beach). You definitely must rent snorkeling gear, because at about 10 meters from the shore there's a really good home reef. Hotel's pool is a nice one, especially when it's hot. Pool is surrounded by beautiful blossoming trees, it's a wonderful place to relax between morning diving and daily snorkeling.I truly love Gili Air and wish to come back one day, and 90% of this love is provided by the 7Seas!"

We were bitten really badly during the night, and on the following morning I saw old dead bedbugs lying around the bed (we slept on one of the double bed mattresses on a loft in a dorm). When we informed the reception, she just smiled and let us change rooms, it was clearly that they knew about the bedbugs problem, but don't do anything about it!

","Average at best","While they are adequate, located well, clean, and a good budget option, they're are better places to stay on Gili Air that are comparable in price.We had no towels in the bathroom the first day. The AC in the family cottage loft was inadequate (would only get temp down to 24C), no blankets for the lower cottage despite multiple requests, brackish water in shower although they claimed it was fresh water, and on the last day there was no water in the bathroom. We had to argue for a refund for the last night (we left a day early due to no water - read - no functioning toilet). It was like pulling teeth to get any money back, which they finally did. Oh yeah, there was a full moon beach party across the street on the second night that they didn't bother disclosing upon check in, but did send a flyer out the day of saying that they were not responsible for the noise!On the plus side they have a good breakfast included in the room rate with very attentive restaurant staff."

","Reasonable stay at a great price","We stayed in the backpackers hostel section of 7SEAS. The price was excellent. The room itself was divided into two bunk beds on the floor and a loft with a double bed where we stayed. Nothing fancy, but the room and bathrooms were in good condition. The heat was an issue, as there were two fans for the bunk beds but nothing in the loft section, and it was sweltering. I would actually recommend sleeping in the bunk beds because of this, even if you are a couple. The pool is good, but the advertised gym was not open. If you want to modify your accommodation setup upon arrival (and the change is technically possible), you will have better luck speaking with the manager than the reception."

","V nice cottages but slow cafe service and overpriced accommodation","Stayed here for 5 nights in December for 790 IDR a night (Â£40) over Xmas. While not expensive in itself it's also not cheap for Gili Air - I realised this after doing a walkaround the island and wished I hadn't paid for 5 nights upfront as I saw places for Â£30 and even less Â£20ish which I liked. And the only places more expensive were significantly nicer. The actual cottages are lovely - spacious, cool, air-con and fan with dresser, wardrobe, huge bed with mozzie net, plenty of power points. Can't fault the cottage at all. Outdoor bathroom nice, good hot shower, but they should sort out the rusty loose tap fittings, fit a nicer toilet and provide a hand towel to match quality of the room (and price). There is a porch outside with daybed and table with chairs. Should put cushions on daybed to make it more inviting. Not a place to really meet people as cottages very private with a gate and bamboo wall - great if you want that amount of privacy of course. Breakfast was good but EVERY day, I waited ages for someone to come and give me the menu. Happened to everyone I spoke to. The cafe, which is open to non-guests too, has a great setting for sunset but never that busy - probably because of the service! Always tons of staff milling about laughing etc, very nice people, but really not on the ball. As a solo female traveller, I was also asked twice by male hotel staff if I was 'sleeping alone that night' - and not in an innocent, badly-phrased way i.e. meaning 'are you travelling alone'. I didn't feel threatened by it but at same time, while I expect that from barmen, street traders etc, not from the hotel staff who should be trained to not say things like that, Both times out of context too - not at the bar while socialising etc. Once when guys came to fix air-con and once at around 11pm when my wifi code had expired and I went to a very dark reception to get a new code. The wifi itself is good but you get a code which is valid for 24 hours. It's a bit of a pain having to remember when you started it etc esp as I had a laptop and a phone, and sometimes the codes seemed to expire early while one seemed to go on for more than 24 hours. Again for the price, I'd expect a better wifi system for guests. Location is good, 5 min walk from harbour at beginning of main east coast strip (lively but not crazy unless Paradiso are having a party in which case 7 Seas warns you!) but I preferred the strip to the northeast which is still close enough to the busier section or even on the northwest and west, though they are quieter areas. All in all, it's a nice place to stay, location worked for me as a solo traveller, I did feel safe there, but there really are better, nicer and cheaper places on Gili Air."

","Can I give it zero stars?","You could write a novel about how bad this place is. It would be a comedy. Here is a quick recap since I already wrote a novel length review and it got lost before I was able to post it. So here we go again!Rented a deluxe cottage/bungalow with my friend an her mom. They got the big bed with a mosquito net, I got the extra bed, no net. The windows on the doors in this room are slatted and open to the outside permanently so when I go to bed, I am instantly eaten alive by mosquitos. So I head to the front desk for a fan. Easy enough. Not so fast...The guy working at the front desk is in outer space when I explain my situation and ask for a stand up fan. He just stares at me for a minute then ask, 'Do you really need a fan?' Yes. Ok, so he goes and asks the manager who is a young guy working in the cafe. Manager says I already have a stand up fan in my room. I say I don't. Desk guy says he wants to check my room. Okkkaaay. We get to my room and this is when I really start to wonder about this guy. He is looking for a stand up fan. He checks the closet. Fair enough. Then he checks under the bed. Kinda weird. Then he checks under my backpack and moves around my friends mom's laundry. Obviously not under our laundry. Then he picks up a glass of half drunken old juice sitting on the shelf and asks if I am done with it (I assume he means to take it back to the kitchen) and when I say yes, he drinks the rest and puts the empty glass back. Wow. Anyways to make this story a lot shorter the guy goes back to his manager, manager says I can't have a fan, I say I want to talk to the manager, he refuses to speak directly to me even though he speaks English and will only speak through the desk guy to me (because I am a woman???). Finally I loose it because we are paying a ridiculous sum (something like $75 USD a night) to stay here and I can't even sleep. I have a fan in thirty seconds.Second. Dive shop. I came to 7Seas to dive. I pop in the dive hop on the first day to check out dives for the next day. There are a bunch of workers hanging out in the shop, no one can tell me what dives are happening the next day, tell me to come back at 5pm. Back at five, lots of people sitting around still, tell me to come back at 6, not sure what dives will be the next day. Ok. Come back at six: 'Sorry, we're all booked now!' Really??? Ended up diving with Manta. They were great.Third. Breakfast. Ha to be at Manta to dive at 8:30am. Ordered my breakfast from the 7Seas Cafe at 7:40. Didn't get anything (not even drinks) by 8, went to check on everything and explain that I had to dive soon. The staff just stared at me blankly. 8:10 still nothing. I am freakin out at this point because I don't want to miss my dive and I don't want to dive on an empty stomach. 8:20 breakfast arrives and is cold (!!!), 8:27 juice appears. Yikes.This place seems like a place that is past it's prime. Maybe great once but now is just kind of a joke."

","Great diving, average hostel","We stayed in the backpackers here and we found that the elevated platform with the double bed was way too hot, the wifi did not connect most of the time and we found the few dealings with the staff to be quite hard work, the service in the cafe was terrible - they didnt know the price of things and often forgot drinks but hay that is island life! The dive centre however is excellent we could not have ask for more from the staff, we did 3 great dives and we will be back in the future. Our DM's were great, i would like to thank Ifan, Mika & Fabian."

","Great value when split with friends","Stayed in a cottage with 2 other friends. There were nice enough to bring in an extra bed. We were hoping for a better price during low season but wasn't able to haggle them down much. That being said 700,000/ night split 3 ways was well worth how great the cottage was. Aircon worked well, beds were comfy and it was clean. Open air bathroom was the highlight. Internet was mediocre and it was dark in the cottage unless you had the door open. Great location. Beach in front of property was pretty rocky but it was just a short walk to the best beach (in front of scallywags). Overall a good choice."

","Worth every penny","After a cancellation we managed to book one of the cottages for 2 nights and were not disappointed. The cottage was spacious, clean and had a lovely bathroom under the stars outside. We didn't mind that the shower was salt water at times as it fitted in with a beautiful ambiance. Breakfast was provided across the road overlooking the sea and was more than sufficient for our needs. As the cottages are opposite a bar it could have been extremely noisy...luckily the main party night was happening at another bar further up the road so I suppose we were fortunate. All of the staff were extremely helpful and made our stay most memorable."

","Mostly perfect -beware the nightly 'duff' parties","7Seas is lovely accommodation. The rooms are comfortable and spacious , bathrooms gorgeous. Yes somedays we had salt water and some days fresh water but heck we were on an island with limited fresh water. The fan in room 4 didn't work, the zircon worked too well - a bit of a dilemma but not enough to spoil our bit of paradise. It is nice to have the little enclosed area around the bungalows but please get some vegetation happening quickly 7Seas- they are so bare and it would be great to sit in a 'garden'. Bed was very comfortable and cannot fault the cleaning.breakfasts were fine and it was wonderful to sit by the ocean and relax into the day. There was a good choice of breakfasts for everyones taste and lombok coffee was great. Evening happy hour cocktails were good too!Staff were not overly interested in us as we weren't diving but thats ok with us as we wanted some space after a buy time at home. If we needed something we only had to ask. Internet was good though getting a passcode every few hours was a drag. It did work well and overall -hey we managed :) We had an almost perfect time at 7SEAS except for the 3 nights out of 7 when we didn't get to sleep until after 5.00am due to duff parties at nearby cafes and a wedding in the restaurant directly opposite our room. None of these of course are 7Seas doing as such but as everything is so close together on this part of the island it is an issue- and we were there at the end of season so I can only imagine what it is like at peak season! We did notice just how much the accommodation had spread around the island in the 2 years since we last visited - it will soon be too crammed for the escape that people look for."

","Affordable dorms on Gili Air","One of the few places that offer dorm rooms on Gili Air. Best price on the island at 70.000 a night.Dorms are clean and the area is cleaned regularly. On the downside, if you want to extend your stay in the morning there is a chance you have to change beds because ""your bed is booked for that night"". In 4 nights I slept in 4 different dorm rooms.One of the dorm beds had a bed bug problem (dorm 5, lower bed), the other three were safe.Friendly and accommodating staff. Includes towel and gym facility."

","Fantastic accommodation","We LOVED our stay at 7 seas. Gili Air is definitely the island to stay on. We booked a cottage which cost quite a lot, but was worth every penny.The room was large, comfortable, great A/C and a really cool 'outdoor' bathroom.Our only complaint was the service at the 'Garden Cafe' for our included breakfast. The staff weren't very attentive. We only ate there for the free breakfast and ate at much better places nearby for our other meals.We also booked in at the Diving Centre and learnt to dive which was AMAZING."

","Dirty glasses and smelly water","We booked in here for two nights in one of their cottages. The location is lovely and very convenient right next to the beach, but then so is most accomodation on Gili air. The bathroom is very large and looks impressive, but the water coming from the shower was really foul smelling. I know fresh water is not in abundance on the gilis, but we stayed in 3 other places during our time there and didn't experience this problem anywhere else. Also when we went for breakfast, the coffee mugs and glasses for water were really filthy. We didn't use them and we skipped breakfast the next day and we were worried about the general hygiene of the place. We're not fussy travellers and don't expect 5* luxury when somewhere like the Gilis, but in comparison to our other stays there, it was very poor."

","Great place!","These cottages are lovely! So big and spacious! Very clean and the staff come and clean your room every day and give you new towels! The bed was comfy and had a lovely net that hung from the roof over the bed. The bath room is cool open plan with high roof top. Really good location just turn left out of you cottage and it's not long until the beach restaurants start! The restaurant opposite is linked with the cottages and that's where you have breakfast! Breakfast is awesome a right feast! The food here was the best we had the whole time we where on gili air and we tried quite a few places! Definitely recommend this place for any one, family's, couples and friends! There's is also a pool here but we never went in it or even saw it we was in the sea a lot."

","Decent room for the price but swelteringly hot!","We stayed in a 4 person room in the 7 Seas Hostel which was really nicely clean and tidy, and the shared loos, sinks and showers were plentiful (but are sea water not fresh water). The 4 person room was a steal at 300k. We had access to the 7 Seas pool which we look advantage of and decent wifi throughout, though you did have to keep logging on to the network with the code provided.The shared room had fans rather than aircon and when we got in to the room that night it was absolutely swelteringly hot, which the fans did little to help until we decided halfway through the night that we should open the door for it would be better to be bitten by mosquitoes than not get a wink of sleep due to the heat. My advice would be to load up on insect repellent and put on a coil and have to door open at night. Apart from this, definitely recommend."

","Great place!! (but the breakfast service has to be improved!)","Stayed 12 nights at this place and found that very good really. The location is great, just around 3-4 minutes walk from the main beach, close to the most restaurants and bars and the Ocean Club Bar, which shows movies on the beach in the evening)). We liked the spacious bungalow we had (bungalow #2), the fenced own territory gives some special feeling of some own piece of land)), we didn't see that in other bungalows/hotels on the island. The terrace is big and has a nice and cosy little sofa, it was nice to relax there in the evenings. Also there's a big round table near the terrace with several chairs, but we found that useless, as it's much better to sit on the terrace and have a drink there. So the tipp to the hotel management - put some small tables at the terrace sofas, that was what we missed a bit. The rooms were cleaned regularly and the bedding was changed in the right time. We liked that and decided to leave a little present to the cleaning stuff. The staff was great and very helpful with organizing the transfers to and from lombok airport at the adequate prices. The one thing which deserves critics is the brekfast in the Garden Cafe. This was a total mess, I think due to the young and untrained staff of the Garden Cafe. The time difference between the baguettes and the coffee can be up to 15 minutes, orders taken with mistakes. Mistakes at every table, not only at ours. Staff just says, ""sorry, yeah"" and doesn't consider it to be a problem, some even go flirting with each other, so they are afraid of nothing really ))).Also If you chose 1 breakfast set which didn't include the little box of jam you get that damned little jam box for extra fee only. If you want to combine your brekfast set with some other (paid) items from other sets - you have to explain that twice or thrice to the staff and hope they don't forget that. The french manager girl Marie tried to organize the staff to make their work properly, but I had the feeling they aren't afraid of her or don't pay much attention.Our advice: either outsource the breakfast to some other cafe or hire a staff trainer (like Villa Karong) in order to improve the breakfast service."

","Only if you like doof doof","Nice room, but air con is very ineffective, especially when the sun has been beating down on the room all day.Room was clean, spacious and comfortable but very very noisy. A bar less than 100 meters away hold regularly - at least twice a week- doof doof parties that go on until at least 5am. This, along with the hot room make it very hard to sleep.Having to go the the reception to get a new wifi password every morning is a pain, especially as other resorts provide free wifi for the duration of your stay.Service at the restaurant was ok, nothing special, far too busy talking to each other to serve guests.I would not stay here again."

","Good Stay","We are a family with 2 children 13 and 8. We stayed in June 2014 for 12 nights in the family cottage. We chose to stay here as we all wanted to do diving courses and preferred a resort with its own dive centre. Generally, it was a good stay (coming from a well-travelled family). Pluses:1. Good location despite the resort being across the road. It is only a narrow strip of mud road that adds to the character. Could not snorkel easily though because of all the boats around. Loved the little gazebo like huts on the beaches with cushions/beanbags.2. Spacious, value for money rooms. Clean enough. Don't expect frills! Expect a rustic charm and you won't be disappointed. It is only a 3star resort but delivers well provided you don't expect 5 or 4 star treatment. 2. Food portions and quality were good, especially local cuisine.3. Dive centre was professional and honest. They informed that we had been overcharged and returned money! My husband and son did their rescue diving course and found the Instructor, Cecil superb. (guessing she is a free-lancer though!).4. Front office staff were friendly and helpful. But the restaurant staff take the cake. Special thanks to Rehman and the twins, Desi and Yuni. Rehman was very good with young children.5. Despite all the criticisms here, found WiFi connection to be fantastic in almost all places in the resort. We had the same password, one for each device (5) all through our stay, except last day.6. Of our 12 nights, only two nights were noisy. 7. Most of the times, towels were changed and in abundance. Couple of days they were not, despite us putting them on the floor. they were hung again by housekeeping for re-use. When questioned, they explained that their laundry was delayed from Lombok. But, kept their word and delivered the towels in the afternoons.Negatives:1. Mixed feelings about the dive centre staff. Professionalism quotient is high but friendliness is not. Found a couple of their comments bordering racism (this was on our first meeting). Same attitude after a week could be construed as friendly, but at first meeting joking about a particular country's mannerisms is insensitive. 2. If you are not diving, then you can forget family fun. It's not like in Bunaken were, two members could dive and two members could snorkel with a guide. Here,while, my hubby and son were diving, my daughter and myself were made to feel like the fifth wheel. They struggled to find a snorkel guide for us, except for once, despite us having specifically requested for it at the time of booking (and it was confirmed as well in email!). Having booked 12 nights here thinking that they would be beginner friendly and kid friendly seemed a big mistake.3. My daughter and myself went to 3W Dive next door who seemed very friendly towards beginners. I was going....""so much for staying in a resort with dive centre for 12 nights thinking we would be treated well if not special"". 4. To go to the family cottage, we had to go past the staff quarters. The staff call out to you saying Hi and when you replied with a hello......you would get a continuous ""how are you....good day....etc...."" With the other staff heckling and cracking jokes in Indonesian. You can sense the ridicule which they assume would not be evident. After two days and stern talking to them, it didn't happen again. Unlike the front office and restaurant staff, these guys need some training in attitude towards customers.5. If not for the initial hiccup with the Dive Centre and the attitude of the staff near the staff quarters, I would have given this resort 4 out of 5 ( also didn't like the mossy, slippery patches around the pool.)"

A bar just a few doors down hold all night, yes all night (finish 5am) very loud doof doof music parties every Monday night and at other times if there's a birthday or other celebration to be had. Don't expect to get much sleep those nights, a major risk for those scuba diving the next day. Power outages were annoying as was the need to collect a new wifi password from reception (down the road) every morning. Bathrooms could do with a good clean/gurny. Apart from those issues, the rooms were nice, comfy large bed, well kept, nice friendly staff and close to the dive shop, restaurants etc. Would stay again if not for the all night parties as above."

","Do not stop there !","The only good thing is the location. A terrible value for money! It is way too expensive for the service.This place is old and the owner didn't have the idea to renovate the rooms for example the balcony has a lot of holes.The bathrooms are disgusting, you don't even think to touch the faucet and the sink, there was a lot of limestone and moisture. The ground was also bad. The water of the shower did not flow and it was hard to get some hot water. The fact is you don't need hot water in the Gili but when it is included in the price, you expect it to work well. We had 2 bungalows, and each was the same problem. So we came and ask to the staff & the owner, they came and try to fix the problem but they didn't solved it, the owner seemed to be indifferent to this!Also the common areas are not cleaned and you don't feel like you want to stay. The swimming pool is just like the rest, is not maintained. The breakfast was ok but the bar on the beach looks sad and desert. All the bed on the beach are really dirty. That's why there is nobody in there! Don't stop in this place, and for the same budget you will find really much better!"

","Average backpacker room.","We stayed in one of the backpacker rooms for 3 nights, the bed linen was clean and the bed was pretty comfy. Check in and out were quick and the staff were helpful and polite. The room itself was okay, the walls were that woven bamboo stuff which gave a pretty old look to it. The room sleeps four people (a large bunk bed and a doublemezzanine but we were only a two so we had a good amount of space. It's also really good value at only 200,000 rupiah a night. The salt water showers aren't as bad as people make out. It's not like sea water or anything, it's just slightly salted and you don't come out feeling salty at all. The shared bathroom was okay, could be cleaned a bit better in the corners but there were plenty of showers and toilets for everyone. The pool at 7seas is very small and seems to be used for the divers as well which could be awkward. It's also at the front of the complex so it's not private at all. I'm pretty sure this was the only pool. We didn't experience any terrible problems with mosquitoes either unlike some of the other reviewers. My main complaint and also some constructive criticism is that they seriously need to do some dusting! I mean come on! It's not hard to whack a duster around the beams of the room is it?! I think because it's just a basic room they leave it but it's a serious cleanliness issue for this place. I would stay here again if I wanted to do Gili Air on the cheap but I think I'd insist on some dusting being done! :)"

","An experience we won't forget.","After the first day it started to rain (which happens in the raining season) and then it started to rain in the room too and we didn't like that so we asked for and got another room. It started raining in that room too however so we asked for another room again.Given choice then to be split up wasn't accepted by us and we asked for an upgrade for the inconvenience and got it âº.The (cold salt water) showers in the hostel are reasonably clean as are the toilets. The place for brushing your teeth however wasn't. The many leftovers from other guests were there a lot and all kinds of insects too.The rooms in the hostel are what you can expect for 200k for the whole room in low season on such an island, but still noisy and it's not a very handy layout to put the double bed at 2 metres height with steep stairs to reach it (hot air goes up you know?).There are a LOT of mosquitoes but no net or other meanings against them are provided.When you ask for extra towels to use on the beach you pay a small deposit for them.People in the hostel were really service oriented âº.The food and drinks in the restaurant are over prized and you can easily eat for half the money or even less than you would spend there so we didn't eat there but in the zipp bar (nice food) and Santay (great food). Also service in the restaurant is not the same level as the hostel and that's a pity."

","A very mixed feeling experience","I just spent 4D/3N diving here.I will start with what was not good.1) I made the booking via email communicating with Clhoe (or something like), who told me there were public boats to gili air every 15. That wasn't true. Once I arrived on the island, I found out that said person is based in Bali.2) while struggling to get a boat to the island, I called the resort number on the reservation 4 times, but nobody answered. I found out later that is a disconnected number.3) on the second day, I have to go thru 20 different password and access code to get the wifi. Eventually, the receptionist delivered the massage from the boss that there was a problem with internet from Lombok. That wasn't true, so I had to threaten not to pay for the room to get a working access code and password.4) then, came the drama of paying the bill. When I made the reservstioo, said person (again) quoted me 8 dives package knowing when I arrive and depart (my flights). The truth is that the most I could have done was 5 or 6 dives. So I get a bill with a different discount as agreed on the reservation. Eventually, I paid what I was quoted.The good things are:1) well clean place and nice spacious rooms.2) shower and bathroom looks good if you are ok to shower with salty water but hot.3) breakfast was included and had a selection of preset combinations. All pretty good.4) when I checked in, they didn't ask me for a form of payment, which was cute. I am not sure if they had forgotten or it's simply cause you are on a small island, so you can't really run away.5) The dives were good, except that on the 2nd dive the dm had forgotten to open the air on his tank until he tried to go down. Yet, he was very good at looking for great stuff down there.6) on the last morning, they accommodated my need to leave early serving me breakfast quite early. Yet, there were some pieces of wire in my juice (see the pic). Overall, if you set your expectations right or below what it seems to be, you will be delighted of your experience."

","Not good value for money","We stayed in a family room for 4 nights and at 990,000Rp p/n for 3 people it was not good value for money. The door of the downstairs room only stayed closed when locked so my son had to lock himself in each night (not good if your children are young). The upstairs room had a lovely view of the water once you looked over the bathrooms of the villas in front. Bean bags on the veranda were comfortable.The Sasak style villas are very nice with wooden floors, rattan walls, curved ceilings, but they lack the details I expect for this kind on money. No glasses, old towels that were not replaced over our 4 day stay, nowhere to hang towels or wet swimmers, the air con had a bright light that shined in my face all night and the day bed did not have a single cushion leaving it so uncomfortable we didn't use it. The pool is used for diving so it lacks style and beauty and is not particularly pleasant to hang out.Breakfast was good! Served in the bales on the beach, generous serves.A new password was required for the internet each day and had to be re-entered every time you logged on. Using my phone for work (checking emails etc) meant entering a password every time I opened my phone, this nearly drove me crazy.Location is good!"

It turned out to be an (unapologetic) member of staff - not a problem as we were offered another room, but added to the general sense of disorganisation. The biggest draw back was the noisy location. We specifically asked about how noisy the rooms were, and were told it wasn't a problem. It was fine in the Thursday night, but on Friday we were kept awake until 5.30 in the morning by the music at a nearby bar. Overall, not a bad choice, but book ahead and you can probably find as nice a room with better service in a quieter location. Xx"

","Do your research before booking here.","If you are happy with salt water showers for your stay and a basic service, then you might be happy staying here. The delux rooms are situated on the main track, so don't expect a sleep in. Building works happen until late at night and you won't get fresh towels. There were no glasses in the room, hand towel or face washer. Just the basics. The room was clean and what staff there were, their English was basic. The Garden Cafe where you eat breakfast, needs some serious work as they are under staffed and just not equipped to cope with more than 10 people. There was no care for picking up the rubbish around the resort and the pool area was very basic and salt water. I would look at other resorts for value for money. The location is good with lots of delicious eating areas around. Scallywags was the best by far. Not cheap but brilliant service and food."

","7 Seas Cottage","We stayed for 3 nights in an AC cottage. Our cottage had its own compound and which was fully fenced and had its own entry gate. The cottage compound was clear dirt although it did have a garden setting (table & chairs, and a beach umbrella).The cottage was made up of a front verandah and 2 large rooms. On the front verandah was a large day bed. On entering the cottage you were in the bedroom which was large. It contained a large comfortable bed, a wardrobe, mini bar fridge, bedside table, and a chair. This room had shelving all along one wall so there was an abundance of places to put things! The room was clean, the bed comfortable, the reading lights worked, the Ac very effective!The other room was a very large bathroom. It contained a salt water shower, (hot water) 2 hand basins and a western toilet. This room also had ample shelving.We found the room very quiet at night but we were right on the footpath leading to the 7 Seas backpacker accommodation so you would hear guests talking as they went past.Overall we were very pleased with the cottages. We spent all our time exploring the island, laying in the gazebo or swimming. Recommended!"

","Good location, nice rooms","We stayed at 7seas for 3 nights and enjoyed the space of our bungalow. We were right across from the beach where we sat in a gazebo most days. The staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms have lots of shelving and space and the bathroom is huge. The cost was reasonable and I liked being able to close the gate when I went to my room each night."

","The place to see","My friend and I stayed 4 days on Gili Air at 7SEAS in a standard cottage, the accommodations were very clean with a nice atmosphere, I especially loved the open roof bathroom where we could see banana trees.On the morning we just had to cross the path to enjoy an amazing swim; I saw wonderful turtles in front of me while I was snorkeling and that just a few meters away from the beach. We often had the beach for ourselves, like a private beach so peaceful and quiet. It is so restful not to have cars or motorized vehicles but only the sound of the waves. But we were happy to enjoy a free wifi access everywhere on the resort to send our friend photos and make them jealous...The Garden cafe served a delicious and various foods that we could enjoy on the beach sit in the traditional Bale and just chilling out. The staff was very friendly and always smiling at us.We also went to dive with the professional and friendly diving team of the diving center 7 seas and the extra surprise for students like us were the special rate on the accommodation when you are client of the hotel and you go diving their!! The resort and all its services are a very good value for money. I highly recommend it to all of you!!!"

There is free wi-fi internet working from the room.The cafÃ©/restaurant for breakfast is just in front of the room with direct access to the beach.

","Comfortable Bungalow Near Beach","I stayed at the 7Seas cottages in a bungalow. It was very comfortable with a spacious room, a front porch, an enclosed 'yard' area, and a private outdoor bathroom in the back. I stayed for five nights and enjoyed it very much.Note that the bungalow is not directly on the beach. Most of the rooms/hotels in Gili Air are located across the sandy, unpaved road from the beach. The rooms to not open directly to the water. Most of the restaurants and cafes are on the water.7Seas is conveniently located near the harbour. They have good diving and bike rental opportunities too. The staff were all very friendly, and the restaurant was pretty good."

","Bad Internet or no internet and average service","I had booked a 5 night stay at 7Seas and cancelled after 1 night. Service upon arrival was OK, i was with my son and carrying very heavy bags of which all the staff watched me struggling on arrival having a little joke in Indonesian (of which i understood, not all Bules (foreigners) don't speak the language), i ignored that and checked into my room. The room was basic but clean with a good sized bathroom. The room had AC, a small fridge, a hard bed, a desk and a fan. Outside the room you had a small private area with a lounge seat and chairs table and a rotten beach umbrella. I had a ""beachfront Villa"", it was more roadfront and quite noisy with the sounds of the horse buggys and people passing by. I needed to work from the Island and booked based on the fact that wifi was meant to be good here. I was told on arrival to come back for Wifi, i returned about 5 hours later to be told the manager was not there so to come back again, i then had an international telecon to dial into so went back later and was told by the extremely rude guy at reception that internet had finished, then he pointed towards the beach for me to go there, i went to the office at the beach and the said they had hourly internet that i had to pay for, they then sent me back to reception. I went back to reception where he said very rudely its not working. My friends daughter then said to me that she could get it from him and he walked up 2 mins later to him to which he promptly walked over to the padi dive store accross the road and got it for her. When i asked why he couldn't do it for me i was faced with abuse from him, i could not believe how rude he was. Unfortunately this tainted my experience at the hotel and given the fact that i needed reliable internet i checked out the next morning. The other staff were OK but lacked any sort of customer service and unfortunately didn't speak very good english at all (very lucky i spoke indonesian) i did witness a few frustrated patrons trying to order food and the language barrier proved problematic for them. I think villa satu tiga, villa casa mio (excellent) and oceans 5 are better options to stay. If your looking for basic clean accommodation in a good central location and don't mind lack of service and average food then this is the place for you. The place had some great potentIal given a little more staff training from management, improvement in the food, english lessons for the staff and the pool area being a little more inviting. I also looked at the family rooms and they looked quite nice (2 bedroom villa) for around $90 AUD."

","Gili Air - wonderful stay for the family","We stayed in Gili Air in July 2012 for four days after climbing Mt Rinjani coming by small boat up the coast from Sengiggi. We stayed in the family bungalow with two rooms, air conditioned and a magnificent spacious bathroom on the ground floor. We had a private court yard with the lounge on the verandah, perfect for laying on whilst reading and it was located next to the pool. The kids had their own private room downstairs which they were very happy about and the restuarant was just over the road. Each morning we would start with a swim in the refreshing ocean, the beach was deserted so you had the whole place to yourself. Breakfast in the beruga is a wonderful way to start the day, fresh fruit and Indonesian food. The staff were very friendly, wifi was available and the location is great to explore the island. The main jetty is just up the road and the massage places are an easy walk. The Mt Rinjani massage recovery program was perfect, combined with snorkeling, swimming, enjoying meals at the many different eating places on offer. We mainly walked as we enjoyed stopping and looking at the various shops and finding diffetent places to spend the morning. The horse taxi is really good when you want to go to the other end of the island (fixed price no haggling) and it passes through some of the back streets so you have a different perspective. The whole island is very easy to walk around. It is a lovely place to enjoy, highly recommended."

","Wonderful accomodations","My daughter and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. The bungalows are very clean and spacious . The bathroom was so huge it included a ladder. Im still puzzled as to why there was a ladder in the bathroom, It was the lovers bungalow so I suppose it requires imagination.The bungalow included airconditioning , fan, refrigerater and a small safe. It had a very large private outdoor area with table and chairs to eat a very nice breakfast brought to us by friendly staff. This hotel also had a large clean pool with plenty of lounge chairs. The hotel is situated on the main road and short walking distance to all beaches, restaurants, and bars. The only negative is the shower is salt water. For me, it was easily overlooked, because this was the very best accomodation I had in Indonesia. I highly recommend this hotel for the price, quality, location and service!!"

","Seven Seas -simply super","Much as we love Bali & the Balinese people, it was a God send to discover Seven Seas Resort on Gili Air. It was like stepping back in time to a beautiful oasis in a busy world. Swimming, fishing, snorkelling, diving, sunbathing and then a slow massage to finish the day. Wow! Seven Seas fitted just perfectly, the bungalows were excellent, staff were so friendly, food was good and did I mention everything was so peaceful? The resort caters to all travellers, backpackers to 5 star luxury in the soon ( if not already) completed Villa, complete with a massive private pool. All guests that we met during our stay were very impressed. Our grown up kids ( 21-29 years) did'nt want to go home."

","Great place to stay and to dive !!","We went several times to the 7seas cottage with my boyfriend and it's clearly my favourite place to stay in the Gili islands, we came back at least 3 times with friends and everyone loved it as well ! Gili Air is very relaxing, the bungalows of 7seas are brand new, comfortable while respecting the environment which I find very important in such a beautiful and wild place. I especially love the big and opened bathroom, it's all very clean and the breakfast is simple but good with delicious fresh fruit juices. Prices are reasonables and the staff are always smiling and ready to help, the French boss Laurent who is a dive instructor and has lived in Indonesia for many years is also very interesting to discuss with.7seas is also a great dive club, I did a few dives there, including my very first one! The instructors were very nice and professional, the corals around magnificent, we saw sea turtles even when just snorkling in front of the hotel !!!My advice, just go see for youself, you won't regret it ! :)Catherine"

","Great dorm experience at 7SEAS","I actually stayed at the 7SEAS backpackers hostel which is on the same site as the cottages - perhaps this part of the complex is fairly new and so not listed yet. Anyway...I can definitely say this is one of the best hostels I've stayed at. The rooms are very clean and maids come around every morning, and with just one bunk bed and a double bed (on a higher ledge) in each of the dorm rooms, they never get too crowded. There are plenty of showers and toilets (at least 4 of each if I remember right) and the location is great - pretty much one of the first places you'll pass if you turn right from the harbour, and whilst it's just seconds from the beach, it's set far back enough from the main road that you don't really get disturbed.What else...WiFi is free, and whilst breakfast isn't (and for 70k a night who's complaining!) there's a couple of nice places just across the road where, coincidentally, internet access via a real PC is also free if you're a 7SEAS guest.If you're looking for somewhere cheap, clean, with good facilities, and in a great location then you could do a lot worse...I would have stayed here a LOT longer than five nights if I didn't have to catch the dreaded fast boat back to Bali for my flight home!"

","Highly recommended - great value, great location.","We moved to 7SEAS Cottages from other accommodation on the island that we weren't 100% happy with. Our criteria was that we wanted to be closer to the main bars/restaurants on the east coast (but not so close that we'd be kept awake all night!) and preferably somewhere with a pool and hot water for the shower (hard to come by on Gili Air!)We spent a day scouting accommodation on the island and had the benefit of being shown the rooms prior to booking. We were really impressed when we were shown the cottages at 7SEAS which were enormous compared to where we had been staying, with the addition of a huge bathroom with double sinks and gorgeous shower space. We opted for the standard fan room which was $55 a night (air con was available for $75 but we found this close to the beach you didn't need it because of the sea breeze).We spent two nights in cottage number four and couldn't have been happier. There was a ceiling fan, floor fan, fridge (with mini-bar), wi-fi, safe and more storage space than you could ever possibly need! The shower was salt water (as many on Gili Air are) but ran hot which we were happy with.There's also a nice outdoor space with a day bed and a table and chairs with an umbrella where you can opt to have breakfast if you wish.We were also impressed with the breakfast menu (we took ours in the cafe with gorgeous loungers looking out over the sea) - you get a choice of six or seven set menus ranging from fruit salad with fruit juice and tea/coffee to more elaborate options of bacon, eggs, toast etc all included in the room price.The location is literally 30m from the beach and about a 5 minute stroll from some of the best restaurants and bars on the island, but despite that we were never disturbed by noise from the bars. Before booking to stay we even wandered past the accommodation twice between 10 - 11pm to make sure it was a quiet spot!The pool was great and we particularly glad we had it on day three of our trip when a sandstorm kicked off in the morning and stayed all day - meaning hanging out on the beach was impossible! The pool was nicely sheltered with loungers and we only briefly saw one other couple come for a brief swim while we were there.The staff were also really friendly and would offer help on booking tours or even just hiring snorkels etc - we wouldn't hesitate in staying here again if we ever return to Gili Air."

","On the main road, nosy morning and indifferent staff.","I write this review sitting at the restaurant of 7SEAS Cottages. The woman serving us breakfast is acting as if she is doing us a favor. Kept telling us what we could not have as opposed to what we could get in breakfast. Yes, its free breakfast but why the attitude?I got woken up at 7am by nosy staff members and all the morning activity involved with getting the place running (I guess). Considering they knew we were staying in the cottage right next to the reception and restaurant, they could have been quieter. There was more noise from the staff joking around and conversing than from the normal activity on the road at that hour.Some positives that sold us on the place: clean towels, room and spacious bathroom. No fresh water is provided (even in a bucket for rinsing, brushing, etc like other places seem to offer) but that's to be expected on Gili Air. The beachfront restaurant gazebos are nice and looking out onto a quiet, beatiful stretch of beach...good place to chill and surf wi-fi read etc.But getting woken at 7am by noisy staff and a waitress who was completely indifferent to us killed my desire to stay here longer or return. Its a shame because the place has potential but won't go far unless they hire friendlier staff who have even some degree of hospitality."

","Loved this Villa","We really liked this villa, the best room we had on the Gili Islands actually. We stayed in June for 3 nights for 350,000 per night in a fan room, number 3 and believe it was excellent value for money. It was close to the pier but only a few minutes walk to the Chill Out Bar (great food) and Zipp Bar (great happy hour). It was so quiet we heard no noise whatsoever at night, no mosque, no roosters and no music. The rooms were extremely large, the bedroom and the bathroom. The bed was huge, and both rooms had so many shelves to put unload all your pack. There was also a wardrobe and desk and a day bed on the patio with a gate providing our own private enclosure with outside table chairs and sun umbrella with colourful flowers and trees growing along the top of the fence. The shower had hot and cold fresh water and also a fresh water swimming pool (a rarity it seems on this island). It is attached to a dive business, we stayed across the road from a restaurant, but this end is only busy during the day so it was very quiet. Great options for breakfast. There was a fridge, ceiling fan and portable fan, free WIFI. They also make up your room daily. Was sad to leave but wanted to try the nightlife at the other end of the island so needed closer room, but once we left we found more nightlife at Chill Out, Zipp and Scallywags than the other end, so we may be going back!"
"Lombok","Qunci Villas Hotel","4","ej2331","
Jakarta, Indonesia
","Unprofessional","On 20th Feb 2016, my family and I were supposed to check in but we were told we had to book another room because we brought two children and a nanny. My wife originally booked for two adults because she has always done so with other hotels and we had just stayed in Sheraton Singgigi for two nights with the same arrangement. This was by no means a way to trick hotel operators because our children were less than 5 years old, so we never required extra bed as they sleep with us on the same bed, and we never had any issue at all with every hotel we stayed in. And we explained to the hotel manager that we had to make a last minute decision to bring our nanny because my youngest one had an allergy condition that arose prior to our trip, and my daughter was evidently showing this allergy on the day we arrived at Qunci hotel, her skin was all red and she was scratching all over. We also explained to the manager that due to this sudden change of plan, we had brought a folded-mattress for our nanny to sleep on the carpet, which is a normal thing to do in Indonesia. But the manager refused to even look at my child and insisted that we book another room. She told me that her issue was the nanny (extra adult), not the children. And she did not say that she had a problem with the nanny sleeping on the carpet.Then she offered a lower rate for the extra room, of which we were leaning towards accepting the offer. But I told her that I would ring Sheraton first to see if they have a room available, because I thought it would be more comfortable for us to deal with a warmer reception. I then asked if she's willing to refund us if we cancel our stay, and she said yes. So in front of the manager, I tried dialing Sheraton but my phone had no signal and neither did my wife's phone (we both use Telkomsel). After a couple of times, I hung up and then I was suddenly given an envelope and a form to sign. I asked the staff what it is and she said it's the full refund. Oh my, I hadn't even cancelled the booking. So it seemed like they wanted us out and this really angered me. But I was never rude during this ordeal.The hotel manager then stepped in and tried to calm me down. Then I stepped out onto the road to see if I could get a signal (the hotel security saw what I was doing). Failing to get a signal, I made my way back to the reception and told the manager, then she quickly offered me to use the hotel phone to which I quickly accepted. I was on the phone with Sheraton in front of the manager and hotel staff, and they could listen to what I was saying. Sheraton was happy to take us back and offered a free shuttle to pick us up, however the shuttle could only come in 30 minutes. We then notified Qunci's hotel manager and she organised for the refund. My wife also told her that we would write a bad review for having to go through such experience, this wasn't a threat at all because we told her only after getting the refund and I believe all travellers are entitled to write reviews. Anyway after waiting for 5 minutes, the hotel manager offered us the hotel car to take us back to Sheraton, I appreciated that and I accepted.I do believe the hotel would be a great resort to experience, because I was the one convincing my wife to stay there. And the hotel manager was never rude to us, however there is more to customer service than just a smile. For one, she could at least attend to my daughter and looked at her when I pointed out her condition. And two, my wife had told me to just pay the extra cost and I was leaning towards doing so because it was only 330 thousand rupiahs, but then I was handed the form to sign and the envelope full of money before I even cancelled. I don't know what the policy or the standard is, but I do believe a 4-star hotel is not meant to treat customers this way. We totally understood that different hotels have different rules, but surely customer service standard should be the same and in fact should be better in some ways."

","Living up to their standards!!","My hubby and i went to quinci on the last day of our stay at Lombok. We regretted not staying there longer! We got ourselves the partial ocean view room. It requires climbing stairs, but privacy is guaranteed and a good small ocean view and also waking up to the sounds of waves was simply spectacular. Our room was beautiful, furniture was state of art, and artwork was nice as well. We had complimentary welcome fruits. There are garden view rooms, and ocean view rooms, the ocean view rooms are ground floor, but offer less privacy due to it being situated near the walkways and restaurants. The infinity pools were very nice, 160 m deep each, clean, and wasnt too crowded due to presence of 3 pools to choose from. There were 3 Restaurants which each offered different varieties of food, all of which are on the beachfront, and provide beachside tables with candlelight, food was excellent, we had no complaints. But most importantly to every hotel, is definitely the workforce- the staff- were very friendly, helpful, and accommadating. They were always concerned and gave us the best service, we felt very welcomed and at home. Kudos to the staff!I was in touch via email with the management, and there was a slight glitch through the website, however the staff and accountant in charge were accomodating and replied emails within days, and subsequently provided the best solutions. I was very impressed. The only cons i would say is the beach- which is open to goods sellers, such as wrap-arounds, blankets and tshirts, as well as on the spot massages, was a little bit disturbing to those who were not interested , it disturbed our relaxation time. a solution would be to set up a souvenir stall in the hotel perhaps? Or outside the hotel itself? Otherwise, i wished we had booked another night here, would definitwly recommend this hotel and come back here again! Good job to management, staff and chefs! "

","Relaxing in Lombok","The Qunci Villas was our final destination after a week in Lombok. We spent 2 nights relaxing after a hectic week in southern Lombok. Our rooms which were ""Garden View"" were fantastic and were well worth it. The Ocean View rooms were not that private and were the same layout as the garden view rooms. We sampled food from both restaurants and the bar and the food was reasonably priced for a resort but was excellent in its taste and presentation. Overall service by the staff was very friendly and responsive. Nothing was too much trouble.We had a look at the Villas up on the hill in preparation for a potential wedding. The staff were very helpful in showing us what was available. Thanks Qunci Villas for a lovely stay. We will definitely be back."

","Beatufiul resort & most-friendly staff!","We are delighted to write a review for the Qunci Villas Resort where we stayed last week and had by far our best holidays ever!Short and sweet review: Qunci Villas most likely is the most beautiful resort in Lombok and offers not only a marvellous scenery with its direct beach access and their 3 pools and pool deck area, but also has the most friendly staff we ever had the pleasure to get in contact with! Book some nights and convince yourself! You wonât be disappointed â I promise!Slightly longer review (maybe interesting for Scott):After spending one week in Bali, we wanted to have a change and thus planned to visit Lombok as well. Based on a friendâs recommendation, we chose to stay at Qunci Villas from February 14 â 20, 2016.Booking: the booking through the QV website was easy. We took one of their early-booking offers and got a beautiful 2nd floor villa/bungalow with sea-view. Even when I realized that I did something wrong with the booking dates, the issue was solved right away by E-Mail. Also when my credit card statement showed some unsettling large amount, QV re-confirmed that nothing was wrong (in the end my Swiss bank had some issues to properly show charges in IDR).Arrival/Check-in: We planned to arrive at Qunci Villas on Sunday, February 14. After having some days of rain in Bali, the sun was shining that Sunday all day long and thus we couldnât motivate ourselves to catch a speedboat to Lombok in the afternoon. In the evening, we learned the hard way that speedboats only operate until early afternoon and the only other possibility would be the public ferry which operates 24/7 (we didnât know about the possibility of taking a plane at the point of time). Thus, I called QV in the afternoon and informed them about our late arrival (we planned to catch a ferry in the evening around 6pm). Since we didnât know exactly when we will arrive, we agreed that I will call again as soon as we are on the ferry so that QV could arrange a driver. For some reason, they sent out a driver right after my first call (instead of waiting for my second call to let them know that I am on the ferry). Thus, our driver had to wait for over 3hrs at the harbour until we arrived â we felt very sorry for him. However, if you read on you will find a remark about the staff and the Balinese / Lombok people in general and then you will understand that this is something that can happens sometimes. Based on your own personality you either have the greatness to forgive them and laugh about it, or you are some picky, ânouveau richeâ and snobbish type and should consider to book another resort anyway.The check-in then was simple and straight forward. Btw: Taking the public ferry was quite fun, although it takes 4-5hrs (whereas you wait for one hour like 50m in front of the harbour because the ferry that departed an hour earlier has to unload stuff for like an hourâ¦), it is cheap as hell (like $2 per person).Hotel/Room/Resort: As said in the prologue, QV is the most beautiful resort we ever saw! The rooms (bungalows or villas or whatever you want to call them) are simply gorgeous! And they have the craziest thing on earth: incredible cool open air showers! Just awesome! And if a fu**ing open air shower canât take your breath, then nothing will! At least my girlfriend almost died! :-) Everything was nicely prepared and clean upon our arrival and the interior was classy but decent. The resort area with its green grass (which seemed to be maintained like every day as everything was always freshly cut â big applause for all the gardeners!) and its huge pools and pool side decks are incredible beautiful! And after your first breakfast at the front deck in front of the sea, you never will have another breakfast somewhere else â I promise!!! Restaurants/Food: QV does something that you wouldnât expect but adds greatly to the overall experience: They run two restaurants, one with an Asian menu and one with a Mediterranean one â both for very reasonable prices! I mean, they just could have one restaurant with two menus but no, they have two distinct restaurants so that you have the feeling that you actually go to another restaurant. Even though QV was maybe filled to 50 percent of capacity, they decked every table every night! The food itself was great as well! We had lunch and/or dinner every day at QV and were never disappointed. Every other day they also have something special like BBQ night (was just great!!!) or Indonesian Food Market! Staff/Experience: Now the most important aspect which made our stay so exceptional and unique. The staff â and this includes everyone who is working at QV from the housekeeping staff, gardeners, kitchen staff, waiters, etc. â was incredible friendly, warm-heated and courteous. My girlfriend and I explored Bali and Lombok every day by motorbike as we wanted to get in contact with locals as much as possible and learned quickly that Indonesian people are by far more open-minded and warm-heated than most of the Europeans. Thus, we knew that we will encounter a friendly staff at QV as well but we didnât expect to meet so many friendly and cheerful staff members (regards to Ria :-) )!! This made our stay perfect! We think you should take the chance and have some nice chats with the staff as they enjoy it very much to talk about their lives, their work and their heritage as well as about everything around QV. And for us it was great to learn some things about QV, about their patron Scott (which has to be a great guy as well!), about the fact that there is a Tourism School and that QV offers internships for tourism school students but also trainings for the sellers who walk around the beaches.Now the other â but quite funny - side of the coin: You simply have to accept that most of the Indonesians are not capable of providing the same degree of organisation, planning, forward-thinking and efficiency as we would expect it from our work or from our home countries (and as a Swiss, I usually only accept very precise and flawless processes). You might see it when you order a wine or drink and they bring it 15min before your dinner or 15min after you started eating, or when you request something like an iron boardâ¦ I think Scott, the owner of QV, even said it here on TripAdvisor once that he also knows that his Indonesian staff might not be famous for their organizational skills which we think is very honest but also quite cute :-). This leads to the fact, that they often are not able to arrange something in advance (remember the story about sending out a driver for our arrival at the public ferry harbour). Also when I called in the morning and asked to have a motorbike to be arranged in one hour, there was no motorbike when we showed up :-) But this has nothing to do with QV in particular, as we had the same âissuesâ in Bali as well as we tried to have a motorbike be ready for the next morning. Funny about that is the fact, that they always confirm your request and promise you to arrange it. But when you show up, they donât know anything about the request anymore. My girlfriend and I are usually deeply relaxed and thus took such scenarios always with a good laugh. The staff usually also realize that they did a mistake and are eager to provide a fast solution. You really have to accept the fact that most of them live in the âhere and nowâ. Try to ask them about the weather a week ago, you will get 3 different answers for sure :-) Funny anecdote which visualizes that fact as well: When we enjoyed the happy hours at the QV pool (itâs from 5-7pm), one of the waiters asked us if we want another round of drinks before happy hours closes. As a Swiss with a precise feeling for time I thought that itâs already past 7pm but the waiter said it is 6.35pm â even though no one of us had a watch, he said it with such a conviction that we thought he might just checked the clock in the kitchen or whatever and ordered another round. Quite surprisingly, he came back 5min later to let us know that itâs already 7.15pm (haha) and thus he canât offer the drinks as part of the happy hours anymore and asked whether itâs okay to put them as regular drinks on our bill. We had to laugh about it so hard!!! And accepted it â however that was the only situation during the entire stay where we thought that they should have offered us the drinks anyways as they ensured us it is still happy hours (but who caresâ¦ we enjoyed the best holidays ever and didnât care about a couple of bucks for some drinks :-) ).So, Qunci Villas might be the best hotel for you, ifâ¦.- You want the greatest hotel/resort experience ever!- You want to relax and enjoy Lombok with its beautiful fauna and flora.- You are looking forward to meet a very friendly staff.- You are very relaxed and take it easy â even if sometimes a request might be forgotten (e.g. ordering an iron board)Qunci Villas might not be the best hotel for you, ifâ¦- You are looking forward for having an open air shower but then cannot understand why you have 1-2 bugs in your bedroomâ¦..- You have to act like a diva or snob and think that everything has to be perfectly executed and prepared in time- You get stressed about the hawkers/beach-side local sellers who try to sell braclets or SarungsNote to the management/Room for improvement:- Try to get a little bit better organized when it comes to special requests (e.g. having a motorbike ready in 1hr)- Try to offer something (e.g. a reduction or free drink) if a mistake was made obviously (e.g. the happy hour issue)- Toilet brushsâ¦ no comment needed :-)- Inform guests who leave Lombok through the Lombok airport that this is probably the worst airport ever â we waited 4hrs for our plane â the airport staff had no idea where the plane was and eventually checked the status of their own plane on flightradar24.com (incredible) and almost missed our flight in Bali.We will come back for sure â maybe even this year! Would be cool to meet Scott maybe :-)"

","Beatifically calm, Unspoilt paradise","Loved this hotelFantastic rooms , ours had an outside bath as well as shower, which we were told was new. Everything is very tasteful at Qunci, from the decor, the staff, the food. We absolutely loved our 5 days there and wish it could have been longer.We didn't move far from the hotel , but this was our last stop after a busy sightseeing trip in Bali.DO NOT trust the 'fast boats' from Bali, we were scammed and ended up forfeiting our return journey for a much safer option and flying. We were recommended by Qunci to fly Garuda, as they were a better bet with delays and we were very satisfied with the flight, and service.Definitely would stay at Qunci again !!!!!"

","Perfect Paradise!!","We stayed in the Villa Qunang, outstanding!! This Villa was amazing, what can I say... To have breakfast served on your own private terrace next to your own private infinity pool, well just amazing! We had our own butler's of which were fabulous, always on hand if there was anything we needed, very chatty, attentive and good with our 17 year old daughter, it was almost as though she had a friend to chat too! We had two lovely bedrooms straight opposite each other across the balcony so we were on hand if needed, I say this as we did have an Earthquake during our stay which did freak our daughter out (me too if honest) The communal areas of the hotel again, they were fabulous, we did eat in a number of restaurants within the hotel whether we took breakfast or evening dinner, the food was outstanding, some days a little lost in translation, but nothing unresolvable. The beach was stunning, a few hawkers that do make good entertainment as the days go on they do remember your face from day to day so a cheeky wave from your favourite hawker etc..The hotel staff just like to please, my husband was desperate to watch the Challenge Cup Final on TV, unbelievably they found it for us on one of the hotels channels and not a sky channel (happy hubby).The hotel have a restaurant in the Art Market called De Quake (yes I know and strangely enough yes you got it, we were booked in the same day as the Earthquake) - fantastic food!! fabulous!!I would be back to this hotel in a heart beat! I highly recommend this hotel!"

Rooms are beautiful and clean, the hotel is famous for its arts collection, the gardens are nice and the pool area with the most beautiful sea view is marvellous. Beautiful sunset, good drinks and food. We could not be happier! Everyone was super nice and a big plus is the atmosphere - it seems like almost no other people are here to bother you due to the small amount of rooms. We will definitely come back. Thanks, Qunci."

Restaurant food is surprisingly good.Superb service, so kudos to the service staffOnly improvement needed is the layout of the rooms on the ground level, my room for eg is located along a pathway to the restaurant/pool with people walking by. If I'm in the room I'll have to keep the curtains closed, maybe have some tall shrubs/plants along the pathway; or install those 1-way mirror windows to give some privacy."

","Close to a perfect stay. Will be back.","We spent 5 nights at Qunci Villas, and loved (almost) every minute. The location, a bay north of the main Senggigi resort town, was quiet and offered picture-postcard sunsets. The food was delicious and varied (except in one instance, detailed below), and the service was flawless.Be warned though: this place is popular. We booked 3 months in advance off-peak and had to swap room types mid-way through our stay.AccommodationWe stayed one night in a partial sea-view room, and the rest of our stay in a non-sea view bungalow. We were upgraded to a larger non-sea view room with outdoor bathtub because we were celebrating our wedding anniversary.The rooms are spacious and well-appointed. The beds are large and very comfortable. Some rooms have TVs, others do not - so ask in advance if this is an issue. The bathrooms are open to the elements, however, which could become an issue (with dampness) if you visited in monsoon season. Non-Seaview rooms offer the most privacy, and to be honest, we didn't feel the partial sea-view room offered any advantages. It really was a 'peer above the tree line and between the buildings'-type of sea view!RestaurantsWe were pleasantly surprised by the variety on offer at the hotel's restaurants. They have really nailed their guest's interest in eating good quality Indonesian food, while also mixing it up. Five days of rendang is great - but sometimes you just crave something else! So with that in mind, the lunch and dinner menus cover Indonesian, Thai, Japanese and Western food, with some Mexican thrown in for good measure.That being said, the one time the hotel let us down was with the food. We had some canapÃ©s with cocktails on our second evening, and I ate a dodgy prawn. I was pretty much bedridden for the following day with food poisoning. Usually this sort of situation would make me pretty mad at the restaurant, however the hotel did a few things that demonstrated their level of commitment and service.The following morning I rang the hotel spa to cancel my appointment. The staff member asked if I was feeling OK, so I explained the situation. She apologised profusely and then (unbeknownst to me) went to tell all the other staff at the hotel. By the afternoon, when I resurfaced briefly, the staff by the pool knew my plight and ensured I had enough water to drink. While I was out of the room, more water was brought to our room and it was quickly cleaned. I was feeling pretty weak, but I decided to join my wife and friends for dinner. The staff already knew of my situation and offered to design a salty vegetable soup to help me recover. The following day, every staff member I spoke to asked about my wellbeing and seemed genuinely concerned and apologetic. It was this level of coordinated attention that really set Qunci apart for me.Despite the setback we really enjoyed our stay at Qunci and would recommend it to others."

","Dream-like destination except for the hawkers!","Myself and my fiance have just returned after a few days here and adored this resort!We were fortunate to get upgraded to a beach/pool facing bungalow which we loved (our original suite stank of petrol.) Bed was huge, bathroom with outdoor shower was incredible, infinity pool was sublime and while I personally didn't enjoy my dinner choice we loved having a candle lit dinner watching the sunset on the beach. Very romantic!The hawkers were the only major negative but a pretty big one - it definitely ruins the vibe when you are constantly badgered to purchase sarongs, peanut bowls and jewellery while you're trying to relax, and when they aren't trying to sell their wears they stand on the perimeters of the pool area watching you.. which is really off putting!All in all, we loved it and would recommend. Make sure you head down to Le Chill for drinks at sunset too."

","Warm, welcoming and beautiful ~ helped me fall in love with Lombok","Walking onto the meticulously curated grounds, I knew I was in for a treat. I had 2 nights here in November and couldn't wait to come back...so I did! First...the staff...personable, accommodating, always helpful (the second I left my room both times with luggage in tow, someone stopped what they were doing to take care of me). The rooms are tastefully decorated with art from local artists; large, comfortable beds; ample space to unpack and settle in; a front deck to have morning coffee or practice yoga, and a beautiful outdoors bathroom. Showering under the stars! You have your choice of restaurants, great happy hour (I suggest the drink of the day) and a few locals on the beach who can help you with anything. Drivers, surf lessons, massage and yes...trinkets...but this is everywhere. Do not miss the spa. I am a bodyworker, so highly specific about the bodywork I receive, and both treatments were divine, plus they accommodate slightly later hours. Finally, I get the sense that the hotel has a lot of respect for the locals, and I really appreciated this. I love this hotel and only wish I had written the review during my stay, as it would have been even more full of wonderful details."

","definititon of 'boutique'","I have visited the hotel with my husband and 7 year old son and stayed for a week. The hotel, staff, food and spa, everything has met our expectations. We could all swim in the sea and even have surf lessons. Also the beach is really good for taking a walk. We also took a day trip to Gili Islands arranged by the hotel and loved it. The season is wet and it rained heavily at nights. No leakage, no disturbances related to weather as the hotel is kept in good condition. Nice pool by the sea, good massage, friendly and caring staff. The only thing, we found missing was a mosquito net above the beds. They spray the rooms everyday for mosquitoes but still there are ambitious ones to get through."

You can't rest in peace, constant shouting ""Ms. Sir, Hello"" and showing their products. A lot of guests have complained. Unfortunately the security guard and other staff don't really do anything with some effect. The hotel has a spa, but often guests order the cheap massage from the beach ladies. They then can enter the hotel grounds and take the opportunity to ask other guests to get their massage."

","Beautiful Resort","My husband and I spent a week here for our honeymoon and could not fault this perfect resort! We originally had a room on the ground floor near the pool on the right hand side of the resort, we asked to be moved to a first floor room (we wanted a balcony) and staff went above and beyond to assist us with our request. We were moved to a lovely room on the other side of the resort looking out to one of the pools and the ocean. It was amazing. We had breakfast delivered each morning (great selections), had a massage in their spa, went to dinner each night looking out to the ocean and swam daily! It was the perfect spot for our honeymoon, the customer service was impeccable. I attended a cooking class one morning and had a one on one with the chef ""Is"", it was a great experience and my husband and I got to eat all the food after - there was so much, we couldn't eat it all. We did leave the resort to go into the town a couple of times, but there wasn't a lot to do in the town and preferred to stay in the resort. I'd suggest hiring a scooter if you want to get out and about."

","Perfect despite the weather","We are actually still guests of the hotel and will be here for another night. Writing this review as the weather has not been good to us and we have a little time to spare. This hotel really is a gem of a hotel and we could not recommend it more. On the first day, we were checked into room 53 which is one of the ground floor rooms. Like some of the other reviews, we were concerned about privacy, however foot traffic is so light that it doesn't really matter too much. When we spoke to Tony at front desk, he was more than happy to move us upstairs to room 53 on the second level. In comparison, the rooms upstairs do have more privacy, but you do lose direct access to the pool area, and the downstairs rooms have a larger bathroom with a really cool outdoor garden/plant feature which was nice. I cannot fault the staff on training and attentiveness. All staff are courteous and accomodating from the front of house to the gardeners (who would stop what they are doing to say good morning to you). Wait staff in the restaurants are clearly trained, knowing exactly how to set each placing and remembering to always serve on the right side (which nowadays is often forgotten in the service industry). I watched today as one of the security guards picked branches and twigs which had fallen on the hotel grounds after the storm. I can tell you that where I come from, security guards would never do this as it's not their job. Clearly the staff here take pride in what they do, and to the same extent, the hotel. Not sure I agree with some of the negative comments about staff and their training, this is far from the truth. On the note of discrimination by another reviewer. As for the majority of my life at home I am in a suit, when I come on vacation I undergo a metamorphosis to swap the suit for board shorts, a tee shirt and Havaianas, even sometimes at meals. At no time have I ever felt that the staff discriminated based on appearances. They treated us no differently to any other guest when I came admittedly more casual than I should have!The restaurants are top notch and the breakfasts despite not being a buffet, is very very good. My partner and I have resolved that despite costing a little more, the quality of food and service has us preferring to have all our meals in the hotel, which is rare. As per the title of the review, the weather has been atrocious for the last couple of days, despite this the staff have really gone the extra mile to ensure the stay is a good one. I rarely write a review, however we really felt it was deserving. My only complaint? I was looking forward to this eggs benedict people had written about, only to find it is no longer on the menu :)"

","Awesome resort, highly recommend!","We stayed for 4 days with our two teenage children. Qunci was just as described in the other reviews, and we absolutely loved it. We had a garden villa, with 2 rooms - kids up stairs and parents downstairs which worked well. The staff and service is absolutely amazing, and the quality of food from the choice of 3 restaurants was fantastic. The property is amaculately maintained, and is a great place if you are looking for a relaxing and chilled environment. My son managed to find some surfing waves out front with the locals, there were options for a great local massage around pool, or the more complete Spa onsite. We flew to Lombok from Bali, but given the 1hr transit from the airport, we might look into the boat option from Bali in the future as it may work out to be quicker and less hassle to Sengeggi and probably less expensive. While we didn't venture too far from the resort on most days, we would highly recommend the day trip to the Gillie Islands for some snorkelling and sightseeing. A short walk down the beach you will be able to charter a single outrigger boat, that takes you on the 1hr trip (we went with the captain of the 'Dolphin', who offered a very competitive price and was excellent for our needs to see the main island and do some snorkelling to see the amazing turtles). Hiring a private boat directly from just down the beach from Qunci proved to be a much easier and more flexible option, rather than having to get the family up to the northern port of Bangsal and then having the reported hassle from touts as you try to book the shorter ferry ride to the islands. Qunci definitely looks to be the pick of the accommodation in Lombok, and was very reasonably priced. Highly recommend for those looking for something top class, romantic or relaxing and where you aren't seeking multiple options for Watersport activities etc. directly from the resort."

Special thanks to Noah and Andy for such a great help to us. And not to forget Ajis, our driver transferring us from the airport to the hotel. Room: We stayed in the 1 bedroom with private pool, Quntum. It was a good choice because it offers privacy and the mood is set for intimacy between the loved ones. Me and my wife really enjoyed it. Qamboja Spa: We had a jet lag package. It was good. Thumbs up to Seri & Puji (if im not mistaken) for the excellent massage. Location: The villa itself located at Mangsit, which is the calmer part compared to Sengigi which more caters for the partygoers. Honeymooners will loved it because the villa itself offers the calm and chill ambience. Pros: - the food is delicous- well maintaned facilities - high standards of professionalismCons: - could have offer more activities  Qunci Villas is the place for honeymooners. Definitely.

The place is so efficiently run and the hotel and grounds are maintained to such a high standard and the atmosphere very relaxing. I think one of the main strengths of this hotel is the attitude and proactiveness of the staff who are obviously very well trained, They always went of their way to help us and there seemed to be an ongoing training programme. This is a truly special place so I have no hesitations in recommending it. I cannot think of any improvements as the hotel management seemed to be on top of every aspect.

Nice decor in the rooms, comfy bed and outside bathroom and shower (if you like that sort of thing, it's great!).You can spend easily multiple days just relaxing near one of the three pools on the amazing deck starring out onto a sea of blue and green enjoying a drink or food. A few meters from the hotel if you feel like walking a few steps, is good snorkeling, daily tours, surf school and good restaurants. It felt we had our own private beach.

And there are 3 additional infinity pools facing the beach, ideal for relaxing while taking a cold drink. Staff attention is excellent, always very polite and helpful. I had an infection in my right ear after snorkeling in Gilis and the staff called a doctor who came to my room for a general examination and gave me oral antibiotics and ear drops.IÂ´ve never had been before in a hotel with such a geographically diverse cuisine, and most important, that feels authentic and has character. Spanish paella, Lebanese falafels, Japanese soups to name a fewâ¦ Every sauce, tapenade, seaweed or pickle needed to make your dish of undisputed origin is meticulously prepared locally and with experience.

","Paradise!","This is a comfortable hotel in a dream surrounding. We stayed for 5 nights and loved the pools and restaurant. In fact, we never ate outside the hotel unless we were on a tour. Is that pathetic? Food was great, especially the breakfasts. We had a garden room, which as others have said can be quite loud due to the proximity of the mosque and roadway. I used earplugs and a white noise app and didn't find it too bad. They were willing to move us to a different room, but we opted to stay where we were. Obviously if you have an ocean view, the surf sounds will eliminate all other noise, so it may be worth it for you to pay more for those rooms. Some of the suites have private pools which is very nice, but the pools were never crowded even though the hotel was at capacity during Christmas/New Year."

","Wonderful stay","This hotel is just wonderful, beautiful and with fantastic staff. A real gem in Lombok and by all standards of high quality. Pros: very high standard hotel, beautiful art, exceptional staff, incredible spa and three glorious pools. We loved the room which was spotless, stylishly designed and roomy - the bathroom is especially beautiful at night when you can see the stars above. The little details are really taken care of here by the wonderful staff - one night my partners glasses went missing and the staff went above and beyond to track down the drivers and found them. They are great examples of first rate hotel staff. The breakfast was also fantastic and we loved that we get the option to have it brought to our terrace each morning with the same choices as in the restaurants. Cons: during Ramadan it was incredibly hard to sleep due to the noise, of course this is to be expected but it would have been good for the hotel to let us know upon check in, or even by email once booked; the ear plugs provided don't help so eventually the rooms definitely need sound proofing for this reason!Otherwise a brilliant stay!"

The staff is exceptionally trained to know your every want and need without bothering you. The rooms are very beautiful and the food in the restaurant is also exceptional!"

","Incredible","Everything about the Qunci Villas is amazing. The service is next to none. The staff are so professional and there is always someone to help you with anything you might require. The pools are beautiful and the whole hotel is immaculately clean. You'd never get anything like this in Australia for the price of the Qunci."

","Great location and facilities but shame about the Qima room","We were a party of 5 with my eldest daughter and her boyfriend staying in an Ocean View room while my wife and I and our youngest (19yrs) daughter staying in a 2 bedroom wth pool room, called Qima. We stayed for 4 nights from 23 December.Firstly the good points; the hotel location is excellent with great facilities, especially 3 luxury pools looking right over the beach and out to sea. The (upper level) Ocean View room was lovely, beautiful views, good sized bed, and a great balcony on which to sit and admire the view and spectacular sunsets. The food was very good with a la carte selection on breakfasts, and a very good Asian restaurant where we ate for a couple of our dinners. We also enjoyed the happy hour although service was quite slow. The poolside food and drinks was very good too. Our eldest daughter and boyfriend had room service from the European restaurant which they were less complimentary about however. On most evenings there seemed to be a theme meal, including a (very very expensive) Xmas Eve dinner, but we did not participate in those as in several cases they seemed unreasonably expensive. The other standout feature of the hotel was the excellent friendly service from all the staff. Very impressive and made it a joy being in and amongst the hotel day and night.We barely heard the Mosque, and were not really bothered by the beach hawkers. We ate in Sengiggi a couple of times (Asmara was excellent) for a very reasonable cost. The point on which we must express our severe disappointment was with the Qima room. Firstly, and most importantly, we noticed live insects on and in the bed each night. At first this was more noticeable in Qima 1 but we also noticed it in Qima 2 after the second day. At first we thought it a one-off and brushed them off and hoped that was it. This is a tropical island and not a Swiss ski resort after all ! However they re-appeared each day and were of varying sizes from really really small to a more distinguishable size. They did not look like bed bugs, and none of us were bitten (thankfully) but it was very disconcerting and by the 3rd night we were being kept awake just worrying about it. I took several pictures. On the last morning I called the hotel staff to look at it and they said it was from the new ceiling on each room- some sort of woven material. They said the ceiling had been treated but it clearly hadn't worked otherwise lots of black live insects wouldn't be crawling all over our beds !! Whilst I was relieved that these were, most probably, not bed bugs, it is simply totally unacceptable -not least at the significant cost we were paying- to have a room presented to guests in such a state. It was also slightly worrying that the cleaning staff hadn't noticed this each morning. So- the hotel reception staff have seen this in person now. Besides the insect problem, some of the lights didn't work, there were no mirrors in the bedrooms itself, the shower drain didn't work properly in Qima 2 and the air conditioners do not have enough horse power to properly cool the bedrooms. These need to be upgraded urgently. Overall I really wish we had paid the extra to stay in Ocean View rooms. In what was otherwise such a lovely hotel we were very disappointed with the Qima room.If it hadn't been for the Qima room this would be a 5 star review but the room you stay in is such an important factor, especially at the cost involved, that it has forced me to give only 3 stars."

","Great experience at Qunci ","Stayed here for five nights with my partner and felt incredibly looked after for the entire duration. The accommodation, while not astoundingly spacious for the garden view villas, is extremely clean, modern and well maintained. The service from the offset is extremely friendly and helpful (we organised several day trips through reception) and all of the staff seem lovely. The complimentary breakfast is chosen from a menu with fairly good variation and you can't ignore the free delivery to the room in the mornings if you so choose it. There is definitely a ""resort"" feeling to Qunci which may not be to every traveller's taste but in the context of Senggigi it provided a welcome respite and it's easy to get transport around the island from just outside the front gate. While Lombok doesn't yet feel as though it has fully developed the tourist infrastructure, you definitely get the sense that the tourist industry is becoming important and I'd highly recommend Qunci as a place to stay whilst exploring the island. Qunci also has boats on the beach front at the back of the resort to the Gilis that are absolutely worth a day trip (approximately an hours boat ride to reach them from the hotel). Overall, it was a great experience staying here and worth the cost."

","Great finale to our Indonesian holiday","We were in Bali and Lombok for Christmas and New Years. Qunci was our final of 4 stops. The room had interesting art work and decorations. The location and amenities were great. Where the resort really stood out was the staff. Everyone was extremely friendly, welcoming and incredibly responsive.

","Beautiful resort , doesnt like Asians?","My husband and I stayed in the beautiful Qunci villas from 25th Dec to 31st of December 2015. We arranged for a hotel pick up from the airport - the pick up was on time with great service.The amenities and the room was great. The outdoor shower is a treat too - so great to have a shower and look up to see the coconut trees!As this trip was planned to be a relaxing holiday - we intend to do as little as possible ; meaning lots of walks on the beach ; lounging in the pool and sitting by the pool. My husband and I are of asian background - i grew up in indonesia and migrated to australia in the noughties; and my husband is of similar background but from China.We start noticing that there are discrepancies on how we are treated. We brushed it of the first few days. However, it became a little more obvious after the second and third day.One incident is with coconuts. To be clear the whole island is teeming with coconut trees.While browsing the menu by the poolside ; my husband ordered 2 fresh coconuts for us.We were told its not available. We looked at each other. And shrugged. Maybe its popular that day. About 10 minutes later my husband saw two different couples - also by the pool getting served two different coconuts. This time i waved one of the waiters and asked in Bahasa why are we told that coconuts are not available when it clearly is? He then apologises and said he will check with the kitchen - miraculously apparently some coconuts have been unearthed and we were given one.More poolside incidents; we dont get asked if we wanted water even during the hottest period of the day - where the caucasian looking tourist does or even gets served water without being prompted. Again, we disregard this the first day or two; but after the third day it became super obvious.On the fifth day ; it became even more annoying as i was thinking of getting a manicure or some treatment at the spa. There was some ladies from the spa that went around the pool promoting it - giving brochures or showing them. Skipped. Right . Past. us. Didnt even pretend or smile or anything.I was determined not to let this deter me; so i went ahead to the spa to get a manicure and pedicure. I also spoke about this to the very kind lady there - Made. She apologised on behalf of the hotel. She mentioned about being a Turis Lokal, which meant simply a local tourist ; possibly thats why they didnt offer the service to me. While maybe thats possible - its sad.I should also mention none of the above incidents were ever given in an agressive or overtly done because of the way we look.But it sure does make us feel conscious and uncomfortable as we were one of the few non-caucasian couple at the hotel. Finally, its still important to stress that looking like and being be a local tourist shouldnt be a disadvantage or mean any difference."

","Great views of the sunset ... very pleasant hotel experience","I have only stayed in 2 hotels in Lombok and this was the superior of the 2. The Qunci is quiet, idyllic and seems to host quiet and courteous clients only (or perhaps the residents are just quiet and happy because the surroundings are so peaceful and gorgeous). The rooms are large and clean, the showers are all semi-outdoors (great for ventilation in a humid climate), the food was pretty good but note that there is a 21% surcharge on everything so the bill was a bit of a shock at check out time. The spa was also fabulous with a great menu of services. I did the (paid) yoga class as well, ended up to be around AUD35, not worth the money. There are 3 pools - including one adult pool. And the hotel is situated right on the beach so you can take walks, photos, swim and surf. You can also organise a boat to go out to the Gili Islands for snorkelling and swimming. Highly recommended activity. The mozzies were a real problem for us, and I suspect that this must be a problem in the area because the hotel conducts ""fogging"" services, ie a massive amount of insecticide is fogged around the grounds twice a week. The smell was strong but bearable. In summary, great views, service and surrounds. We enjoyed ourselves very much."

","A Real Gem","We spent four nights (December 2015) in this beautiful hotel. There were many different type of rooms to choose from and they were all well spaced ensuring privacy. Relaxing around the infinity pools whilst watching the waves was most enjoyable. However the hallmark of the hotel will have to be the staff, excellent service including wifi service throughout the hotel incl the pool. All the staff from reception, housekeeping, food & beverage, spa, maintenance (air cond) to transportation are so very friendly and helpful. Service was expeditious and there is really nothing to fault. The hotel from staff, facilities, housekeeping, food & beverage is very well managed as even the walkways remain pristine clean. To our amazement we were told that the job is not undertaken by a foreign manager but by a local ""ibu"" - job well done. Thank you Wiwit , Budi, Arie, Donni, Samsul (sorry for forgetting the staff names in the spa) for a most memorable holiday. We will certainly be coming back to room 83 in 2016. Hopefully by then a new aircond with larger HP is installed for the room."

","A relax place to spend your vacation.","We stayed three nights here (Garden view), and enjoyed the stay and also the service provided by the hotel staffs. Most of the hotel staff can converse in English with all the guests. The villas built next to the sea with a very well maintained facilities. Such as the infinity pool (both smoke and non-smoking pool) just next to the seashore provide the spectacular view to you. Especially, during the evening time, the beautiful view of the sunset give you a very memorable holiday experience. You will never bore if spending a day on the deck beside the poolside with a book, and a glass of cold drink. Of course, you can enjoy the cooling pool water under the sunshine day too.Other than the excellent facilities, the hotel also provides excellent food. The complimentary breakfast offers every guest with the variety of chooses, from oriental Indonesian fried rice to continental breakfast, as well as the healthy breakfast too. Besides, the villas provide the ""open"" concept for the shower area. You will have a chance to take a relaxing shower under the starry night or moonlight. It is the entirely new experience to me! The only disappointment is the air conditioning system in the room (room# 59). I believe it is due to I stayed at the individual villas unit with a higher ceiling high, caused the aircon unable to provide the cold temperature as it does not cool off the air completely with the underpower air-conditioner unit installed in the room (per my observation and finding)."

I was satisfied for first impression.. until night when we were slept it was terrible first night.. my fiancÃ© felt any bugs bite him from bed.. when we turn on the lamp lot of blood at our bed! I didn't felt anything about it until 30 minutes later I felt not comfort on my back.. yup bugs at bed try to bite me.. and my blood also make spot there. it is so pity with nice resort but they didn't take care about it.. afternoon I complain about it to front desk and they try to clean and spray our bed with bugs spray also change our sheet.. but I don't know why it still happen every night during we stayed there.. for food just average nothing special also pricey.. anyhow not bad at all..i like prawn popcorn and also raw meat with zukini I forgot about name,, but it was nice..they had a lot of staff but not give us best service.. they just busy with talking with colleague and not keep eyes for looking at us.. hard to asking additional drink or asking help. even when 1st time we ordered drink it takes a very a long time and when we asked they said I'm sorry we forgot to made it. but they gave us for free since it was their mistake.for breakfast it was nice since u can asking them to bring what u want to ur terrace room and ontime!!for beach it was quite clean with black sands and littlee bit wild wave.. but its ok we enjoyed to swim there.. wear ur shoes.. a lot coral there.anyway this resort had 3big pools u can relaxed there with drink cocktail and enjoying sunset.. it was nice.."

","Nice Hotel","We stayed for 1 week at Qunci Villas. We loved the hotel and the grounds. The staff were great to deal with, pleasant and very helpful.The room was clean and nice, though we did have some reservations about the topless female artwork in our room. Our 7 year old son wanted it covered up before he went to sleep.We loved the Spa treatments we had.The pool area is nice, but please note that there is no shallow bit for small children.The resort looks out towards sunset and a distant view of the volcano on Bali. The beach is a little narrow at high tide and comprised of a mixture of black volcanic and gold sand and the surf is good for beginner surfing. Just a stones throw away the beach becomes all black volcanic sand which is interesting.Beach vendors are very heavy at this beach (compared to others I've been to in Bali) and the pool on the property is very close to the beach so they constantly are watching to sell you something. Once you engage one, 10 more will surround you instantly. If you are not interested in what they have the best thing to do is not even say ""no, thank you"", ignore them and they move on. Any acknowledgement even negative will keep them there talking at you.I've read reviews of people being annoyed at the Mosque nearby, but it's a Muslim country and everywhere you go you will hear the call to prayer 5 times a day and we found it soothing. We did have some disappointment with the food, but it is not particular to the resort. The resort food was well cooked and presented. We did find however that some of it was over salted or lacking the flavour we would have expected form Asia food. For example the Thai Green Curry lacked the spice we are used to in other parts of Asia, including Bali. We went into Senggigi, the closest town to a couple restaurants and found the same issues with the food, so I believe that this is more because of the industry clientele on the island and not because of the hotel or restaurants.Overall, we had a great stay at Qunci Villas."

","Beautiful hotel, wrong location ","This is a really beautiful setting and hotel layout, but the photos and amazing reviews are deceiving From a location point of view , the hotel is a 5-10min taxi drive from the town of Sengigi, which has a few shops and restaurants, but not much else to offerThe beach at the hotel is total unswimmable, filled with coral and litter, not to mention the vendors. You can't even really go for a walk on beach, as it's very narrow, and full of litter!Any half decent swimming beach is over an hrs drive away!The other sights and attractions of Lombok are also close to 2 hrs away!With regards to the hotel, make sure you don't have a room at the street side, as you will not sleep, between the motorbikes and shouting from neighboring schools and mosques!All the rooms have outdoor bathrooms, which seem cool, until you need to use the bathroom in either sweltering heat or rain!Management seem to be non existent, although the hotel seems to be well run & very friendly staff! The setting of the swimming pools are amazing, as the photos, overlooking the ocean; that and the good breakfasts seem to be the only saving grace of the hotel."

","Perfect Honeymoon! ","What a PERFECT destination for our honeymoon! We stayed here for 3 nights in the quantum private pool villa early October, and we were just mesmerised! The pool villa is simply stunning, we would definitely recommend.Staff are super friendly and welcoming here - thank you especially to Ria and her fellow staff members at the Thai bar and Ramli-Ahmed who always welcomed us with a lovely, big smile! Spa treatments are AMAZING! Highly recommend, prices are great and if you book it earlier on during the day it's half price! All the spa ladies are super lovely.I can't think of any negatives. Some people seem to complain that the call to prayer is too loud, we never experienced this and our villa was close to the entrance of the hotel - to be honest, I would be extremely happy if I could hear the call to prayer! Also some people are complaining about the locals selling items by the beach - cheer up, give them a smile and politely say no thank you! Or buy one or two things - makes a great souvenir and helps the local economy! It's not going to cost you an arm and a leg, trust me. We look forward to our next visit in the future!

","Amazing and spoiling","We went to Qunci Villas back in March for two weeks to attend my brothers wedding.It was a big trip for us both budget wise and distance and it turned to be one of those trips that we are still talking and dreaming about.The experience started the moment we were met by our driver at the airport in the middle of night. He give us ice cold water and wet face towels to freshen ourselves with after our long flight.We had a partial sea view and the room was beautiful.Breakfast were delicious and we worked our way through the menu and they were very accommodating if you required something different. I particularly loved the platers of fresh fruit that started our breakfast banquet.The staff were lovely so respectfully, helpful and no matter what time of the day it was they always so smiley and friendly.There are so many things to highlight from the spa to the happy hour (although it was 2 hours) to the grounds to extensive soft drink menu and yummy food.I couldn't find fault with it and being there for two week you would expect something to come up.Some people my complain that once a week around 5pm they would fumigate for mosquito's however they always left notes in our room giving you the heads up it was happening and it was near to the end of the day.It was a wonderful and already trying to work out when we could go back again."

We needn't have worried. The facilities, from the garden view rooms to the biggest villa on the hill (where we stayed post-ceremony) were perfectly designed and incredibly comfortable. Staff were incredibly helpful and friendly, especially Wiwit who organized the wedding. Our guests could not stop smiling, as jet-lagged as they were. Sorry to say, but there were several bouts of food poisoning that could only be attributed to Qunci. I imagine it was an isolated situation, and we otherwise enjoyed the food very much.

","Truly your key to an idyllic holiday","A well run resort designed for a memorable and restful holiday by the beach. Starting with reasons why I am coming back! The resort is well designed with a hamourious blend of modern sleek with nature. The garden is kept prefectly maniured by hardworking staff. Lounging huts are strategically placed to maximize your experience by the beach/sea. We stayed at the seaview room on the ground level, just in front of the right most pool.Everyday we were greeted with genuinely friendly and happy staff. Awesome way to start the day. We were quite surprised that the staff are so professional.Our experience with the food there brought us to a whole new level. Great selection of dishes and cuisine with well thought out meal layout (They served great selection of fruits before breakfast and they have special juices designed to detox, energise, etc). Ingredients were fresh and specially flown in to cater to those with a fussy platte like mine. I have never tasted such sweet tomatos in Indonesia.... Salads are also great! Their spa treatments were really really good with staff teaching us proper breathing techniques. The spa environment was also prefect and they use fresh ingredients for the treatments.Overall a truly wonderful experience. However, just one comment. If the restaurants could have some fly buster machines, we won't have to swap flies so often. I nearly threw my phone on to the lawn while swapping flies.(To be fair, I didnt see any fly/insects buster machine in Senggigi too so...)Other info on our stay:-Stayed 6 nights-We had a room really close to the pool with outside seating facing the sea-Because we were located closer to the sea, the prayers from the nearby mosque wasn't that loud-Resort not really located on a swimming beach but with such great pool facilities, it didnt matter to us.-We stayed here about 2-3 wks after the warning of smoke coming from a nearby volcano so the resort wasn't crowded."

","Wonderful stay at Qunci","We had a great time at Qunci. We stayed at a pool villa for four nights and since it wasn't available afterwards, we moved to a sea view room. Both accommodations are just great! We think about booking both again when we come back. The pool villa is amazing, you have a lot of space and a huge pool for yourself. We stayed in pool villas before in Asia, but this one was the largest pool we had so far. It was nice that you can hear a kindergarten in the morning from the pool villa we stayed in. Unfortunately you also hear a bit of traffic, which is not that bad. Several times we ordered breakfast to the villa and also to the sea view room later, which is a very nice service at Qunci.The breakfast is great, you have a great variety of options and it is a la carte, which we prefer. You get fresh fruits with every option and everything is very delicious.Also the food from the restaurants is very good. There could be more local food on the menu, but you can get that right at the beach (Nuff'Said, we also recommend going on trips with the owner) or in Senggigi (Cafe Tenda), so it's no problem. The staff is very friendly and welcoming and you can relax perfectly at the pools. We also had a few massages at the beach, which was amazing and the massage girls are very sweet.We don't think that you get annoyed by the sellers from the beach at the pool, as some people mentioned, since they are very decent and friendly and they do not bother you at all, if you told them you don't want to buy anything. They just smile and greet in the morning. We also don't think that the singing of the Muezzin is irritating at all, as someone mentioned. If you're bothered by such a thing, you just shouldn't go to a Muslim country and it's ridiculous to complain about that.The location of the resort is convenient with a short distance to Senggigi. It's too far to walk, but you always have the possibility to take a taxi in front of the hotel and it's only about 18.000 Rupees to go into town.When we checked out, we had a flight in the evening and Qunci offered us a different room for showering before we headed off to the airport, which we appreciated a lot. Great service!! We'll definitely be back! Thank you!"

","Superb resort hotel","If you are looking to lie by the pool and do little else, Quinci Villas is a fantastic choice - three large infinity pools, a spa, two restaurants, fabulous staff, comfortable rooms, spacious outdoor bathrooms and each room has a terrace with day bed etc to shelter from the sun or rain. The rooms are sprayed every night and the grounds twice a week, so there are few, if any mosquitoes. You can breakfast looking out at the sea and have happy hour drinks enjoying the sunsets. The breakfast menu is extensive and imaginative. The beach is not great but you can surf or get day trip boat rides to the Gilli islands. And there are always cabs outside if you want to explore the neighbourhood - or go further afield. Some small quibbles - I wish the pillows could have been down rather than some kind of foam. And the pools are all 160cm deep, so if you are not tall, you cannot stand without drowning.You won't feel that you have been to Lombok after staying here (unless you explore outside the resort), but you will have had a fantastic, relaxing, beach resort break."

","Qunci Villa..a serene escape!","Wish we could stay longer! 4 days 3 night in Qasmaran is definitely the right choice for our honeymoon and it is an experience we'll never forget. The villa with the private pool provide us with the much needed privacy. With the helpful and friendly staff of Qunci Villa makes the stay even more memorable. The food served in the restaurant is delicious and affordable too! My husband's favorite would be the special, delectable ""sambal"" served with nasi goreng. This is definitely the place for people looking to unwind and relax. Compared to other parts of Lombok, Senggigi area is quite ""calm"" during the night and there are not much places of interest to visit surrounding the villa. I would recommend this villa especially Qasmaran for couples out there looking to spend quality time with your other half!"

","really good choice in lombok","We spent 3 days at quinci and I must say we really enjoyed our stay.Â Â Nice villas,Â  with outsideÂ  patio, well decorated with all comforts.outdoorÂ  bathroom (immersed in tropical vegetation),both shower and toilette are outside, that is, but , no worries,Â  your privacy is safe , perfectly shielded and hey, no air freshener needed!Â Â The resort itself has everything you need;Â 3 restaurants that serve good food, 3 big pools , spa.Â If you stay for one week or soÂ and you want to vary your menu, take a walk along the beach ,Â there are options in otherÂ  ""eating placesÂ ""that serve simple but very good authenticÂ  food.Â One of them,Â does evening fish barbecue all you can eat buffet..really delicious fresh fish!Â Â Being this our ""wind down"" part of the holiday (we did a lot in Bali the previous week), Â  we mostly relaxed by the pool area, so I'm not sure if the location is any good for any point of interests, but it is well connected anyway.All 3 pools are infinity pool with stunning views on the ocean and towards Bali's volcano.Â There is a pool bar and the staff makes a very good job askingÂ regularly if you wish to order anthing, they are obviously tryingÂ  to upsell , but still nice touch..anyway, easy on those refreshing cocktails, it is a slippery slope!Â On the beach side of the pool (technically outside the resorts walls) the locals will try to sell you something all day long..and they are relentless!There is lot of ""whistling"" and ""hey boss"" going on ,Â  potentially an annoyance when you are trying to relaxÂ  but somehow it is part of the picture and can be forgiven.We stayed here in November therefore, not in peak season,it wasÂ  very quiet and everything was nice and easy , ie no queues at the restaurants,Â  no racing to get the best places by the pool etc,Â  that added even more to our experience, however I suspect that during peak season this place can get quite busy.Â Â "

","Exceeded my expectations","We stay for 6 nights in a sea view room. The rooms was clean, well decorated with a comfy bed and good shower facilities. The food was exceptational and the customer service was just a good not over bearing but always willing and polite. There seemed to be enought room for everyone during the day with plenty of sunbeds and a choice of 3 pools. The down side is that they isnt much directly around the hotel to wander too, the beach isnt particualary good, it takes awhile to wade out away from the coral and rocks. We were a group of 7 so enough conversation between us but the nights seemed quite quiet. Overall I do rate this hotel because of the food and the accomodation."

","Beautiful place for a honeymoon","This place was great and the food is very good. The beach is not that great as it is quite rocky going into the sea, but it doesn't take away from how great this place is. They are currently building many hotels in the area (you can't hear anything), so it will start getting very touristy like Bali within about 10 years, so best to see the real Lombok now.We did a trip to the Gili isles from here, which are a must if you enjoy snorkelling.Getting a taxi into the local town is easy and cheap....the most we paid was 20,000 IDR (about Â£1) each way. It is also worth going into Sengiggi at night to go to the local bars where they have music and live bands.We also used a taxi for a half day trip and went to Mataram to see a temple and went to see where they made things like sarongs. It was all done on a meter and we ended up paying about Â£20. If you had done this via an excursion, it would have cost a lot more.Overall, this place is highly recommended as the staff are so attentive and friendly, beautiful grounds and a decent location to get to other places if you want to go out."

","Doesn't get any better","Three nights at this marvellous place. First night was at the ocean view villa. Exquisitely designed and with proper care. A great plus is the soft couch by the window, perfect place for reading or working on a computer - adequately lit and has a view when you need to rest your eyes. The outdoor space is perfect for some food and drinks too. The semi-infinity pools are such turn-ons too. Spent many hours there. The one for one happy hour? Just OMG. Followed by two nights in a garden view villa-second floor. It offers slightly better privacy but the balcony really compensated for the lack of sea views. It is huge and offers great intimacy to the trees. Just good in all aspects."

","The BEST service in the world!","I've stayed at Qunci villa for 3 times now, its almost like an annual visit. EVERY thing about Qunci is great! but above all, the customer service is immaculate. The staff even greets you by name.Also,this time round, i left a pair of trousers in the room, and asked if they could send it back.... and 2 weeks later, wallah! its home! :) I love it at Qunci. However the traffic in lombok had become significantly heavier than it was 3 years ago when we first visited. Would recommend everyone to visit this island before it gets over populated."

","Nice hotel with friendly staff","The hotel complex is really beautiful with lots of plants and everything is very well maintained. The staff is super friendly and is always very attentively. The only things that need to be improved are the poor Wifi reception (especially within the rooms) and the pricing of the restaurants. There other restaurants nearby that deliver at least the same quality for less than the half price.PS: Please ask for a villa closer to the beach as the rooms close to the road/entrance can be pretty noisy in the morning."

","Possibly the best hotel I've ever visited","Wow, Qunci Villas was exceptional from the start! Our transfer from the airport was prompt, the driver was very knowledgeable and friendly and helped us plan some events during the transfer. When we got to reception we were checked in quickly and easily and given a welcome drink. It just got better once we got into our room, we had villa Quesemsem, a private pool villa which was absolutely amazing! the pool was brilliant, room was perfect we could not have been happier. We spent a few nights at Qunci and managed to try their restaurants and they also were spot on, we left feeling that Qunci had thought of everything, there wasn't anything that wasn't done well. The staff are attentive and very helpful, always willing to make sure you are happy, the grounds are amazing, we booked a snorkling trip through the hotel and were provided with a very friendly guide who took us out. We decided to push back the trip by an hour so we could laze around by the pool and Qunci obliged without any questions or hassle.I would have to say if you're going to Lombok you have to stay at Qunci, I would not look anywhere else! It is clear to see why they get so many high ratings and awards. We will be back!"

","High rating is well deserved","It is no wonder that this hotel is highly rated. It delivers on those promises and perhaps a bit more. The hotel area is not big but they have managed to have villas which provide privacy and a wonderful view too (this refers to the sea-facing room). The hotel has 3 pools which are of different sizes and one which is adult-only. Bookings for day trips can be easily done and all the staff are friendly. The restaurants give you a variety of choice from local food to mediterranean to Thai. Take your pick. Wifi is free and is available anywhere around the hotel. It was difficult to decide to go out of the hotel when it was that good. Highly recommended."

The hotel grounds were equally lovely.The staff were polite and ALWAYS willing to help. Food was delicious. The restaurants were top notch and worth the money (c.Â£30 pp).

We had made some preparations before arriving in Lombok but not much. We checked in a week before the wedding, met Wiwit once and made final arrangements. Everything went as smooth as silk. Most of our (28) guests also stayed there and all thoroughly enjoyed it - most comments were ""the best wedding we have ever been to"". Having a week long holiday with your wedding guests also makes the occasion that much more enjoyable. The Food and service on the night of the wedding was faultless. The location is second to none. And the value can't be beaten. This is my first internet review of anything, it really was THAT good. Thanks for the time Qunci we look forward to seeing you again soon. Tony & Elena Black"

","Checked in for Dinner, wish it was for a week","We are frequent visitors to Lombok, seven times in 18 months. We are renting a small house this trip. We have heard so many glowing reports from the people who live here about Qunci that this time we promised ourselves that we would visit for sunset and dinner. In my personal and professional life I have always stressed the importance of local knowledge. I wasn't let down.Qunci visits is located right beach. We had a table at sunset facing the sea, the glowing sun slipping down and Agung in Bali in the background. Ambiance - plus, plus plus and more. Service the same. Friendly, efficient and everything staff in a resort like this should be. Nothing was too much trouble and this is a genuine statement because we ordered from menus from their two different restaurants, there are three.The food was unbelievable. Steamed prawn and scallop dumplings for starters. A generous bread basket with an assortment for dipping in the perfect pesto. My husband had an Italian prawn dish and salad for his main. He can be a fussy diner but was well satisfied. The salad was beautiful, crisp cos lettuce. In case that sounds like well so what, it's hard to get, keep and produce crisp cos up here. My main was a divine Goan coconut fish curry with red and white rice. Thanks to Sally we know that food can be orgasmic. Mine was no doubt about it. Scallops, mussels, prawns and salmon in a spicy but not overheated sauce so the fish could be enjoyed.We braced for the bill and were shocked at how inexpensive the meal, service and everything was. Granted we didn't have any alcohol. We were greatly delighted with everything at Qunci.There will be a next time for us. It will be longer than dinner, at least two nights and completely immerse ourselves in all that Qunci has to offer."

","Can't fault it","I stayed at Quinci for 8 nights earlier this month. We had 1 bedroom villa with private pool, and we spent equal time in our own pool and the share pools overlooking the beach. The accommodation, food, and service were all flawless. The staff were very friendly and obviously very well trained.The happy hours between 5-7pm by the pools overlooking the oceans was something I took advantage of most nights, and lead well into dinner at one of the 3 restaurants, all of which have great open views. I'd definitively recommend Quinci, especially to singles or couples who are looking to get away from it all, and sit on a sun bed reading books and sipping cocktails."

","Great end to our Honeymoon","Stayed at Qunci for five nights at the end of our Honeymoon. We both loved our time there. The resort is beautifully designed and decorated.The ambience is very chilled and relaxing, especially around the pool and beach front area. The two main restaurants are open to the beach and garden atmosphere; very pleasant dining. The beach front benches made for the best breakfast spot; absolutely beautiful. The third restaurant is smaller and specialises in Thai food and feels like a private dining club. One night there was some live music during dinner; this was really good and we would have loved more on other nights. One other point to note: the bar, dinner and music wind down by 11pm. Book your romantic dinner and spas as soon as you arrive, both seem to book up quick.The staff were so friendly and helpful. Thanks guys. A little bit more information on arrival about things to do in the locality and on Lombok would be good.The villa was gorgeous. Loved the outdoor shower. But really the pool was the big star of the show, spent the full day in and around it, wish we were back there now.If you want a beautiful, friendly luxury spot to unwind, eat and be happy, Qunci will not disappoint.Big thanks to our driver Anam. Brought us to the waterfalls and Mataram on day trips and took great care of us."

","Our high expectation were even exceeded.","My husband and I stayed at QunciÂ´s for 7 nights. This week marked the end of a three week round trip through Java and Bali. Prior to our trip I have read all the latest reviews here on Tripadvisor about the Qunci. Of course, this also resulted in correspondingly high expectations. Therefore, I was afraid that my high expectations could be disappointed. When we arrived, it was already dark. However, we were immediately impressed. The atmosphere, which is conjured by the lights is gorgeous. I know that there are some people who have complained about the lighting concept. In particular, because of the legibility of the menus. But on every menu there is a reading lamp. Such trifles show that they considered all details at QunciÂ´s.We booked an Ocean View Villa and I think we had the luck to get the best. The room has an outdoor shower/bathroom, an open wardrobe, a huge bedroom and of course a nice balcony. Everything was very clean and well maintained. The room was treated daily, so that there were no mosquitos inside. Although there is no malaria risk on Java and Bali, but on Lombok, we got all our mosquito bites on Java and Bali and not a single on Lombok. Maybe one reason is the fogging program at QunciÂ´s.The next morning we first explored the hotel complex. And what can you say. Even on the day the ambience is fabulous. There are no corners of the hotel, in which it is messy. And the infinity pools look great.We also really enjoyed the Ã  la carte breakfast. The selection is great. And during our stay we have tried almost every option and all were delicious. There is something for every taste. After many breakfast buffets on our trip, this variant was just great.Since we already had two tiring weeks behind us, our week on Lombok was dedicated to recovery. So we relaxed at the pools. The pools are large enought to swim a few laps or you can go into the sea. In addition, you have the opportunity to surf or snorkel. But you should do this, at high tide. I do not really want to say much to the beach vendors. The beach is public. Thus the hotel can not prohibit the vendors to be there. Just say them you are not interested and everything is fine.After a relaxing day at the pool you can enjoy the Happy Hour from 5 to 7 pm. The cocktails were all awesome and we really tried a lot of them. ;-)The normal prices correspond to european standard. But for that you get large and delicious cocktails. And at Happy Hour two for one. I also tried some cocktails at Senggigi and they were terrible and cost nearly the same.For dinner you can choose between three restaurants. Whether Mediterranean or Seafood, you can not go wrong. It was very delicious and especially the atmosphere at the beach is gorgeous.Whether the rooms, the food or cocktails, everything is worth the price.And the icing on the cake is the staff. Everyone was very friendly and always had a smile on the lips. We especially want to thank Gado and Andri, with whom we had many pleasant conversations. Of course we would also like to congratulate Gado, which meanwhile became a father for the second time. We had a wonderful week at Qunci. Hopefully we have another opportunity to come back. Thanks for everything.Greeting from AndrÃ© and Christin."

","Qunci - Great location overlooking the ocean.","Whilst staying in Lombok we stayed at Qunci Villas for 7 nights - situated about 4 kms north of Sengiggi. Qunci Villas was really lovely with three infinity pools overlooking the ocean. One of the problems with the rooms in this property is that there is very little storage for clothing so âtravel lightâ is the way to go if you are staying here. We had quite a lot of rain even though it was June, which normally is quite dry. Our âocean view roomâ on the first floor had an âopen bathroomâ which was quite a problem when it rained as the bathroom was flooded four afternoons out of seven during heavy downpours. We had to lay out towels on the floor to stop the water running into the other area. The view from this room is lovely â overlooking the infinity pools and also the ocean. There are three infinity pools, all 1.6 m deep including one pool which is adults only.The breakfasts are good, also overlooking the ocean.Whilst staying here, the taxi ride into Sengiggi is quite easy as there is a mini taxi area just outside the hotel.We found a really good money changer in Sengiggi, who was honest and did everything on the computer so was open and above board with everything they did and I would recommend this company, It was pt. padi mandiri, Jl Raya Sengiggi"

Very toned down but elegant reception, wonderful rooms and two long pools parallel to the beach which even has some waves for an occasional surf. Swimming in the ocean is safe and clean. The three restaurant are all very good and offer a variety of cuisines. The spa is luxurious and staff are very good, offering a wide variety of treatments.

","Awesome start of our Honeymoon travels","The breakfast in the terrace in your own villa is amazing, and the sunset with the sun falling behind the volcano were one of the best we have seen in our travels. The food from the a la carte menu is excellent, worth the high (compared to Asia's) price, same as the spa treatments if you get the early bird offers. The staff, we just loved them! Thanks a lot for a great time!!We tried one of the thematic nights menu (the Indonesian night) and we felt it was a bit overpriced compared to the prices, quality and size of the plates in the a la carte menu (which is Excellent!).Water from the tub is not drinkable but they provide you as much bottled water as you request (n the room).Mosque is noisy during the night as at the rest of Indonesia, so good idea to bring earplugs if you have light sleep.Ignore the sellers calling you from the beach while in the swimming pool terrace; it will save you time and guilt feelings (unless you see something you love and really want to buy!)."

","A truly special place.","Qunci Villas is pure bliss, after 6 nights in heartfelt paradise we are so sad to leave. My partner and I r avid travellers and stay in all types of different places and levels of accommadation. In Qunci Villas we were specifically looking for an affordable bit of luxury which would allow us r&r time to just stop, breathe and enjoy our surroundings - Qunci met our expectations and beyond. Beautiful villas, beautiful pools, beautiful location, beautiful sunsets, beautiful food and the most beautiful staff. True, as some reviewers say, there is not much to do in the immediate area but that did not matter to us at all, as our plan was always to stay put and enjoy. Our days were spent doing yoga in the morning (Special thank you to Teacher Wayan for his wonderful classes), breakfast on our balcony, relaxing and going for a dip in the pool or sea, chatting to the friendly staff and eating some of the most incredible food ever. There is also surf lessons and snorkelling gear to hire right infront of the villas. True also, the beach vendors will approach but they are friendly, smiley and not pushy. For us Qunci had it all and we soaked up every bit of it. Out of the 6 days we only left once and hired a scooter from the small warung across the road, it cost 60,000idr for a whole day which was great fun and recommended. One of the highlights of Qunci is their incredible staff. Extremely genuinely friendly, helpful, patient, kind, hardworking, inspiring and always going the extra mile for their guests to ensure everyone is happy. Special thanks to Sendy and the reception staff, driver Mr. Dari, and a very special thank you to Ayu, Ramli, Ajir, and Amil from the restaurant/pool team - you all really made us smile everyday, we will miss you and we thank you so much for making our stay so relaxing and extra special. Unfortunately we didn't get everyone's names but every single member of staff deserves a personal thank you, they are the best! It's not often we return to the same place twice, as we always like to stay in different places but Qunci is an exception - we can't wait to return one day in the future. Terima Kasih Qunci Villas from Miss Pam & Mr RobRoom tips: upper ocean front villas are better for views and privacy. It is possible to hear occasional noises during the early morning and the night, like the school, roosters, prayer calls - for us this was non intrusive but for any light sleepers it may be worth bringing ear plugs for night time. Also for more quiet/privacy ask for a room away from the restaurant end. We stayed in 50 (lower) and 52 (upper) and both were great!"

","Quite literally paradise! ","I am not normally someone to write reviews on places I have stayed but felt I had to following our amazing stay here. The whole experience from the moment we stepped into the reception to the moment we checked out was just perfect. The setting, the villas, the pools and especially the staff who were nothing short of amazing, nothing was too much trouble for them and always smiling and friendly which made our stay even more memorable. Oh and did I forget to mention the food! The food is just out of this world, yes it may be slightly more expensive than local restaurants or warungs in and around Sengiggi (still very cheap compared to western standards) but it is SO SO worth it, we were in food heaven almost every time we ate, whether it be breakfast, lunch or dinner! We did plan to eat out away from the hotel but the food here is too good to miss! My partner and I always like to try new places but this is somewhere we would come back to without any hesitation at all and would recommend to anyone. Quite possibly 1 of, if not the best place we have ever stayed. Pure bliss : )"

","2 weeks of chilled relaxation.","My partner and I spent 2 weeks at Qunci Villas in a Partial Ocean View Room, and it was 2 weeks of perfect chilled relaxation...exactly what we wanted.Our room was tastefully and individually decorated with everything we needed, and the bed was large and comfortable. The whole place was visibly clean and tidy, with attentive and friendly staff. One of the things I appreciated most was the ability to relax, the staff left you in peace and were completely unobtrusive, however if there was anything you wanted they would see to it quickly with no hassle. There was no sales pitch or pressuring to sell you add ons or upgrades, which some other hotels get their staff to do.The three pools are beautiful, with serene views over the ocean and comfortable sunloungers, of which there were always some available.The food was great at all times of day. Breakfast was from an a la carte menu which was varied to suite all tastes, you could have Lunch at the comfort of your sunlounger at the pool or more formally at one of the restaurants. Dinners also had a great selection, so much that I don't think we managed to get through all the things we wanted to try. They also had great themed dinner experiences outside, at romantic tables overlooking the ocean...in particular we enjoyed the Beach BBQ night, with as much king prawn, steak, fresh tuna and chicken Taliwang as you could eat! The quality was always really good, although as you would expect, it was expensive compared to local restaurants outwith hotels. It is worth noting that there isn't many alternatives within walking distance, other than a couple of nearby hotels, and generally if you want to try something different you need to get a taxi into Senggigi (which only costs about Â£1-2). It would maybe be good if the hotel offered a regular shuttle bus service to & from Sengiggi (say every couple of hours?).Although the beach wasn't the best we have seen (fairly rocky underfoot, not white sands) you could still go out for a swim when you wanted or surf at the right time of day. I think the location was chosen by the hotel for its great undisturbed views towards Bali, rather than for the watersports or activities potential.One point to note, as other reviews mention, the hotel appeared to be quite close to a mosque and the prayers could be heard throughout the resort. Although I can appreciate that some may not welcome this, Lombok is a primarily Muslim Island, and I actually enjoyed it thought it added to the atmosphere and to the Lombok experience!Overall, the hotel was as described, beautiful, romantic, very boutique and non-commercial, with great staff that respected our desire for relaxation.Thank you Qunci Villas!"

","Lovely place","Stayed for week with my husband. Lovley place very peaceful and the pool and sea views are incredible. We had a garden room which had the most comfortable bed I've ever stayed in! Fab out door shower however think the rooms are getting a little tired - well ours was anyway ( flaky paint cracked tiles etc ) Staff all so friendly and noting is to much trouble but they do seem to be on a different time zone. You get a coffee at breakfast then 15 minutes later the milk arrives or we ordered an ice bucket which again took 30 mins to arrive. It's an American owned hotel so I was told and I think they probably hire lovely locals but invest in no training, there were several issues with langue barrier being an issue, again I don't blame the staff but the owners. The restaurants were all nice and seem reasonably priced however there is a 21% local tax added which is on food and drink which hikes your final bill up a lot. I didn't experience this anywhere else in Lombok its normally included in the price so be warned as you think things are a good price but you have to pretty much add another 1/4 of the price.... I wish they just included this but then that would make things dearer so be aware. If you want tranquility and beautiful natural view this is a definite contender.Be warned also though that there are locals constantly trying to sell you there merchandise on the beach shouting for your attention. Didn't bother me but if you have payed a lot you might not like this."

","An ""almost"" paradise","First of all, I have never seen a so nice staff and this is gold!The place is great, the swimming pools are amazing, and you feel that you don't want to go anywhere else.But for me, the really big problem was the lack of intimacy, you can't even change your shirt in your bedroom without going into the (beautiful) bathroom or closing all the shades.What is the point to have a beautiful vie if you can't look at it?It should be better for the rooms upstairs but even so, the next unit has a direct view on it.And the hotel should provide shoes to those who dare to swing in the sea."

","Exceptional ","We recently stayed at the Qunci Villas Hotel and had an exceptional time. From the moment of first booking and making arrangements to stay with our young son.A slight complaint was that we had requested a cot for our son. On arrival we were shown the room which was on the first floor accessed by steep stairs, not easy when trying to carry a push chair. The cot, which was a travel cot although the bedding was clean was disgustingly filthy.We requested a change of room and were moved without hassle the next day. The contrast couldn't be greater and the wooden cot was clean. Begs the question why were we given something so filthy in the first place?As you can see I have still scored a 5. As although having the initial complaint, after that I cannot fault Qunci Villas. The grounds are immaculate with 3 swimming pools 2 general and 1 adults only. The staff are incredibly attentive and friendly throughout.Take time to walk around the grounds, the artwork is probably overlooked by many people but it adds to the overall ambience.Food is impeccable in all the restaurants, prices are reflective of the quality. I have read a previous reply about the salt in the Thai food and I have to admit one evening I had the soft shell crab and found it also to be too salty for my taste, but then everyone has different tastes!Best food was in Nooq with the set menu. Out of the 3 restaurants this was by far the best, with a more personal and intimate approach. We worth making sure you reserve ahead for a table.A special thanks must go to Esty and Ayu for all the kind attention they gave to our little boy. Also the staff at Nooq one evening when he woke up halfway through the meal and for taking the time to play with him. It's these small things which make a huge difference in the overall holiday but also of the resort.The 10 days went all too fast and overall it was a fantastic stay.A suggestion? Given the overall quality of the God and restaurants, possibly investing in coffee machines and training a few staff to be Barristas?Paul"

","Luxury Boutique hotel - highly recommend ","Stunning boutique hotel with a real focus on art. Friendly and informed staff. 2 large infinity Pool- Both deep and long enough to do lengths. Artisan touches in all the rooms with gorgeous expressionist art pieces in each room and spacious and huge custom made beds. Bigger than king size. Delightful green palms, frangipani trees and other exotic green trees Landscaped against the forever blue sky. Great location in senggigi. The hotel had little personal touches like fresh fruit platter and frangipani left after bed turn down that made you feel individually special."

","It's A 4 star resort but feels Very Much A 5 Stars","Stayed here from 16th to 19th July 2015 for 3 nights. Highly recommended by friends. We have arranged for pick-up at the airport. Driver was very good and we specifically asked for him to send us back to airport after our stay.On the way to the hotel we were caught in a 2-3 hours traffic jam due to the Hari Raya Celebration in Lombok. The driver was very patient throughout the whole journey.We chose a room with a garden view and it was on the ground floor. If people who prefer more privacy then the 2nd floor room may be better. The room is spacious and clean. The bathroom is partially open air and has a rainshower.Breakfast is a la carte and is good.We had 3 dinners at their restaurant and we thought that the food can be improved.I will return definitely!"

","The only problem is!!!","This place is amazing, I really can't fault the relaxing atmosphere of the resort, the pool, poolside loungers and cabanas are well kept, the service is exceptional always someone at hand when you need a drink etc.The choice of 2 1/2 restaurants is more than enough although funnily enough their Indonesian food could be a lot better.My one problem with Qunci Villas and it is a pretty big problem is that the hotel is diagonally opposite a mosque and unfortunately they start praying every morning using an amplified microphone and speakers at 4:30 am, (5 times a day). To get even close to 6 hrs sleep you need to be in bed and a sleep by 10;00pm. I can't sleep during the daytime so i was pretty shattered by the end of this holiday."

","Best stay of my life so far","I booked Qunci Villas for my girlfriend's birthday and secretly also to propose to her.Before even booking the villa, I had the pleasure of talking to some of the staff via email since I have never been to Lombok, let alone the villa. They were patient and swift in their reply, and I was convinced that this would be the place to go to.I had also added on some special requests pertaining to the proposal after making an online booking. These were very well taken care of by the staff at Qunci Villas. Some of these included, arranging an airport transfer, booking a romantic dinner by the beach, ordering a bouquet flowers, and also a birthday cake.Upon arrival at Lombok international airport, we were greeted by the very friendly driver from the villa who took care of our belongings and introduced us to Lombok and the villas along the way. We each got a bottle of water to quench our thirst during the hour++ journey to the villa. An iPad with information on the villa was also provided.Checking in was quick, as I had indicated an early arrival. We were ushered to our Ocean View room, which had a magnificent view of the infinity pool and (of course) ocean. My girlfriend headed for a quick rest since we had an early flight and I took the opportunity to coordinate the proposal with the hotel staff. During this process, I was also given the assurance to keep the proposal ring with their safe as we were heading for a hike to Senaru crater rim and also to the Gilis for a few days.We continued to enjoy the facilities in the villa, including the pool, spa, and restaurant. The pool is indeed as seen in the photos, spa was effective and the food was simply delicious.We headed off for the Senaru crater rim hike early next morning and was able to collect a basket of breakfast at the reception. (The hike was also via a contact given by the hotel staff, booked in advance)After 4 days in the mountains and gilis, we were delighted to return to the comfort of the villa. Having not had the luxury of a hot shower, we were reminded of how fortunate we were, and wasted no time bathing in luxury.The romantic dinner was amazing as well. The setup was beautiful as was the view and the constant crashing of the waves. Everything went according to plan and the very enthusiastic butler also added much delight to our meal. Needless to say, she said yes :)We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Qunci Villas, and payment is a breeze since everything is billed to the room. Will highly recommend to couples who do not intend to spend more a lot of time outside.Keep up the excellent facilities and services!Travelled on the week of 23 Aug"

","A slice of Paradise!","Quinci Villa's is the ultimate in relaxation! We stayed for a week and wished we had stayed for longer. The grounds are set out beautifully and each piece of decor has been thoughtfully selected. There are ample day beds and sunbeds dotted around the pools, to ensure you can find your own little place to set up for the day. WiFi is available every where on the grounds and is quite fast. The pools (3 of them) are amazing with my personal favorite being the Adults only pool which is situated right next to the bar. We had an Ocean View room which was perfect. With the thatched roof, you could lay and listen to the waves crashing till you fell asleep. Then wake up to the same thing. Having one of the Ocean View rooms is great as the pools, bars and restaurants are all located close by which makes for a short commute if you left something back in your room. The staff are superb and really compliment the beautiful hotel. We were always greeted with a smile and offer of service.They really do go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable.We don't usually stay in the same place twice but we will definitely be coming back to Quinci Villas for some R&R!"

","Beautiful location","We stayed for 4 nights in an ocean view room. The breakfast was tasty. Its not a buffet. Order from a menu and it is brought to your table. Lunch was plentiful. Usually we shared between 2 as there was so much. There are always staff waiting to take a drink or food order around the pools. One day the hotel organised a day trip to Gilli's for us. It cost around 1,000,000 IDR (50 British pounds) for both of us but this included private boat trip with 2 drivers. They dropped us at one island for an hour or so to explore. Then we went snorkeling twice and one of the guys came with us and guided/informed us of the fish/coral/etc. They gave us an hour for lunch. More snorkeling then home. More expensive than some offers in sengiggi but a personal service straight from hotel beach. Great view of sunset while supping happy hour cocktails.Thanks Qunci for a great stay!"

The only downside: that I really don't see a point in visiting Lombok, Bali looked better all around. But as a quick stop to rest and relax in the middle of our Indonesian trip, absolutely perfect.An extra-positive note were the three big swimming pools, just by the sea, made of stone and nicely decorated. One normal, one no-smoking, one no-kids.It's exactly the kind of place where I would imagine a super-rich writer would go to finish a novel."

","Best resort EVER!!!","We chose Quinci Villas as our wedding venue and stayed at the resort for over a week.The overall service provided by ALL of the staff (front desk, restaurants, bars, pool, room services, cleaning, security and grounds staff) was the best service we have encountered in any country at any hotel. The staff were all so friendly, courteous, efficient and accommodating to our special requests. All staff always stopped and greeted us with a smile on their face. We were thoroughly impressed by every aspect of the resort from its wide array of accommodation rooms with cool outdoor showers to the immaculately kept gardens, the swimming pools, to the the high quality and variety of food and drink options (and these prices were not as high as other resorts).We booked Qusia Villa for our wedding and then bulk booked rooms for the week leading up to our wedding. However due to late notice cancellations from our guests and us wanting to tack on extra nights ourselves, there was not one room available for us to stay in the whole time. The Qunci staff did everything they could to avoid us moving from room to room, and upgraded us a few times free of charge, and not begrudgingly either.There are countless beautiful resorts to stay at, not only in Indonesia but in hundreds of other tropical holiday destinations, but it is the staff that will make or break your stay and views on the resort. We could not have been happier with our stay and would one again like to thank Qunci Villas for hosting us so diligently."

","Cool, casual, classy","Cool, casual and classy are not my words about this hotel, but we though it summed up our thoughts precisely! The setting of the hotel is gorgeous, created by the details in the furniture, layout and art work of the accommodation and buildings. The food is reasonable priced and we appreciated other helpful ideas like Happy Hour and massages discounted if you book in the morning. It was a pleasure to spend time the we did here- we really feel the place takes on a wonderful style at night when the candles and lighting come in to their own around the site.However, for us, it was the staff that made it. We were struck by how sincere and accommodating they were and we feel they are the ones that represent Qunci at the highest level. Gotal particularly stood out for us- he is a real credit.Qunci have struck a perfect balance of providing you with a memorable, luxury experience in Lombok without compromising on character- not something every high end hotel achieves.

","Bali or Lombok - What's the difference?","Based on friends recommendations, we chose Lombok over Bali as it was told to be more quite & relaxing. Unfortunately I cannot confirm. Aggressive local sales people are trying to catch your attention with nasty tactics all day long.They are observing you lying at the pool, yelling & waving with hands, showing their stuff they want to sell. There are so many of them, that even saying ""No"" to one of them obviously does not improve the situation. If you looking for a peaceful beach, where you can chill, than this place is not recommendable. Security from the hotel and / or workers do nothing against it. It's just being accepted."

One of us had Nasi Goreng at least once a day during our 2 week holiday and I'd have to say the one at Qunci Villas was our favourite of the whole trip. Very reasonably priced food and drink too. Breakfast was also lovely - all a la carte. One thing I would say is that I'd prefer if there was a self service food area just for things like cereals, toast etc. If you ordered cereal and then say an omelette then seemed to bring it all at once. I think the cooked options being a la carte is great but certain things are easier if self service. Dinners we always ate out of the hotel in Senggigi. My advice DO NOT eat at the Yessi Cafe. Worst meal of our holiday - and we chatted to another couple later who said the same. But there are some other good restaurant options in Senggigi. It's not walking distance, but only 5mins in a taxi so not expensive to get there. Across the road from the Qunci Villas is a great little sports bar called Molly's. I'd definitely recommend this place if you just want a quick walk from the hotel. The lady who runs the place is lovely and will chat and give you recommendations of what to do. The bar also has a couple of TVs - Qunci villas have no TVs - we wanted to watch Wimbledon finals so it's handy having that little bar across the street - go and support it!!We had a problem with our luggage (airline lost our bags for 6 days), but the hotel were very helpful and arranged for our bags to be collected from the airport and brought to the hotel. Saving us a 3hr round trip. So great service from them on this!"

","A personal paradise","We have stayed at Qunci Villas once before two years ago, and returned with high expectations. We were not disappointed! From transfer, check-in and stepping in to the room everything went smoothly with a warm welcoming atmosphere. We were greeted with a flower arrangement and a welcome back card from the managment in our room, which we highly appreciated. The rooms and the resort are beautifully designed and blends with nature in a very good way. It is hard to describe in word to give it justice. The three pools and pool decks are very nice as is the beach. Of the three restaurants we preferred Quali for lunch and NooQ for dinner. NooQ serves a different Thai set menu every night, and we found it fantastic. Excellent quality of food and service in a cosy and relaxing atmosphere. The varm welcoming hospitality and high level of service is found among all members of staff, always with a smile to greet you. We especially would like to thank Esty, Ayu, Andi and Ramli for excellent service and hospitality (and help with learning some Bahasa phrases). When we met Esty again she rembered us from last time and said Welcome home... And that's exactly how we felt! At home with the Qunci family. We will definetly return to this tropical paradise."

","Amazing value and not as busy as Bali ","Visited here in our honeymoon ....We had a suite room with a pool which was incredible as the main pool area can get quite busy. The breakfast was great and could be taken on the beach front which was very scenic. The hotel has 3 restaurants and the food in all was very tasty and reasonably priced - good Thai green curry ! We used the spa which was fun and they offer a spiced bath treatment which was interesting ! Great hotel but get a suite room (with pool) if you have the budget. We stayed at the hotel for 3 days and didn't want to leave"

","A very pleasant stay but, for us, not perfect","We stayed at Qunci Villas for 7 nights in pool villa Quntum. We chose this hotel based on the great TA reviews and the fact that it had rooms with private pools. The highlight of the room was obviously the pool. We were very happy with ours. It looked exactly like the ones you see online on the hotelâs homepage and it had a good level of privacy. The size of the pool was fantastic and it was fairly warm. The outside area of the villa was lovely, with comfortable loungers and a corner seating area and some nice trees and flowers. The room was at the back of the property and close to the road. During the day you couldnât hear too much road noise in the pool area due to the flow of water into the pool. The inside of the room was fine but not spectacular. The room was nicely laid out, the bed was comfortable and the room was kept spotlessly clean by the room attendant. One negative about the room would be the lack of storage space â hardly any drawers or shelves. The other problem was, due to the location of the room, I did not like the outdoor bathroom. Weâve had outdoor bathrooms in other places e.g. Vietnam, Thailand and the Maldives and, in these properties, they worked well and I liked them. However, at Qunci the noise of the road was very loud and also you could often smell burning rubbish and the smell would enter the bathroom and pervade into the bedroom. Also â it was a haven for mosquitoes, especially after the twice weekly fogging when they seemed to find sanctuary in our bathroom! The noise from the mosque, which other reviews have often mentioned, didnât bother us at all. I was especially pleased to have the private pool as, when looking at the communal pool areas, the sun loungers seemed very close together and packed tightly in. I prefer a bit more personal space between myself and the next person! I think we were visiting in peak season hence the pool areas seemed quite crowded â but, noise wise, they were actually very peaceful and the views over the sea were beautiful. The communal areas e.g. restaurants, pools, gardens and even the paths around the hotel were very nicely laid out and aesthetically pleasing. But we often found that, although seating areas looked lovely, they were quite uncomfortable. Seating around dining tables was often very low or slouchy. Huge slabs of stone and wood look very beautiful but didnât feel so welcoming. Dining for us was a mixed bag. Breakfast was great and I really liked the choices available. It was a perfect start to the day. We didnât choose to eat in our villa as the view at breakfast time was lovely. I also absolutely loved the lunch menu and the food was amazing. But, for me, there was very, very little choice available on the evening menus. I was very disappointed with the lack of vegetarian options. I also couldnât understand why such a large percentage of the Mediterranean restaurant Quah menu was seafood based when you could eat plenty of seafood at the Asian Seafood Quali restaurant. I understand that both restaurants cater for more fine dining but I think a selection of the lunch menu in the evenings in one of the restaurants would have been very beneficial. If this had been available we would have eaten at the hotel in the evening more often, rather than going elsewhere. Iâm not sure whether the hotel does room service. I have just read in another review that this was available but I saw no information about in-villa dining during our stay. Another minor moan would be the lack of bar. Yes, there is a bar but most of it is given over to dining and it just didnât feel like a bar. Again, the seating was pretty uncomfortable and very limited. We donât want loud music or entertainment or nightlife but we did feel that the atmosphere was lacking a central gathering point for drinks. Sometimes we went to the beach club next door, Verve, and the Nuff Said warung a little further along and Mollyâs, opposite, for a change of scenery. Service everywhere in the hotel was always excellent. All staff were so friendly and polite and chatty. They were super helpful and a major asset to the hotel. All in all we did have a very enjoyable stay at Qunci and there are many positives to be found. It is a beautiful, relaxing property and the private pool was heavenly but, for us, it wasnât perfect."

","High end luxurious resort placed in unspoiled nature - worth 15 hours flight anyday","It is difficult to express with words how truly amazing this resort is. We traveled in Bali and Gili for three weeks and ended up on Lombok by coincidence since the fastboats from Gili couldn't handle the waves (don't ever travel by fastboats from Bali - far too dangerous - always fly to Lombok) and even though we only spent one night in this resort, it will forever remain the strongest memory from our honeymoon. Everything is the way you'd imagine it on an unspoiled paradise island and with the most luxurious residential settings. You can walk completely alone on the beach, only listening to the sound of the waves - no tourists - no salesmen - and enjoy the sand changing from rough beige to the completely black sand. We truly loved everything about this place and allready now - four days after - we are talking about when we will return, even though it is a 15 hour flight from our country. Go there, you will not regret it."

","Very good and average all at once!","The grounds of this place are beautiful. The rooms are very ordinary. The pool area is huge. If you don't have kids with you this might not be the place to stay as there are a ton of kids running around. The restaurant is worth visiting on its own as the staff is attentive, but very inconsistent. The menu is very extensive with Asian options and Western options, even a rueben! The fresh juices are very nice, but inconsistent. We ordered a beet juice and the glass was half full! The next day it was full. Not sure why. Same glass size. But for Lombok this is one of the only places with a wide range of options."

Thanks to the Qunci Team for making my stays special.There are no TVs in the room or rather you can order one but then it has limited channels and does not really suit the feeling of the Hotel. It is no problem as right next door is the VERVE Beach Bar and I was able to see my Sunday Sports there on their big screen flat panel TV whilst enjoying some sundowners."

","Splendiferous!","My spouse and I spent 3 nights marvelous nights here during a private tour of Indonesia. It was by far one of our favorite hotels. Our idyllic, spacious ocean view room combined minimalist style with Japanese and Bali influences. Local textiles were used throughout. The open-air bathroom was also large and featured a rainwater shower head; the ceiling was the sky. The only downside was that the bathroom became quite hot during the sunny days since it could not be air-conditioned.We stayed on the second story and enjoyed a large balcony overlooking the ocean. It featured an over-sized sofa that invited one to laze in the gentle breezes. The hotel is located on beautifully landscaped beachfront property that overlooks the magnificent Indian Ocean. Swaying palms along with lush tropical flowers create a tranquil garden of delight.The three destination restaurants (Quali, Quah and Qnook) offer gourmet meals cooked to perfection. Breakfasts were included in our package, and we chose to eat these in Quali, the seafood restaurant. The two-egg omelets, particularly the one made with prawns and zucchini, was delicious.The staff is very well trained, welcoming, and provide impeccable service.This was truly a memorable experience!

","Paradise in Lombok","Qunci is a quiet paradise on lovely beach with great views to Mt Agung on Bali. The rooms are fairly basic but spacious and the beds are excellent. But you won't spend much time in your room as the gardens and pool areas are absolutely beautiful. Three pools with plenty of comfortable lounges in both sun and shade, overlooking the beach. The real surprise though was the quality of the food. We stayed for 8 nights and every meal was made from fresh ingredients and beautifully presented. The food is mostly Asian in style with excellent Thai food at Nooq. We would like to thank the reception staff for helping us make a very hurried change to the ferry back to Bali when the airport closed due to the volcanic ash cloud. If you like lots of nightlife, Qunci is not for you - it's a stylish, quiet retreat. We would love to return."

All details are thought through: locally sourced materials used for the construction, art pieces set a bit everywhere in the hotel, an excellent building quality and a constant maintaining make this place very refined. The 3 different pools and different (super tasting) dining aeas offer a stunning sea view. Rooms themselves have less charm than the hotel shared areas but the overall experience, together with the excellent service and incredible spa will take you to heaven.

Villa was gorgeous and spacious, staff were wonderfully attentive, pool and rooms cleaned every day, stunning views and fantastic peace and quiet. Absolutely could not fault it at all. We stayed 1 night in 2 of the 'bungalows' in the hotel and again could not fault them - all amenities and very comfy beds.Lovely pool (x3) areas, great happy hour cocktails and the restaurant(s) food was good with a lot of choice though generally I prefer to eat out and explore more. There's a warung either side of the hotel with very slow but charming service and stuff lessons on tap. Hotel breakfast we ordered the night before and had served in our villa - was always delicious.Its everything you would expect but much more than you are paying for.

","Gorgeous stay in magical Lombok","Stayed here for one night after diving in Gili Islands and it was an absolute pleasure to arrive at this resort. The resort is situated on the beach and the water is nice and clean. We stayed in a partial ocean view room on the second floor. The room was large and clean and came with a big balcony as well. The bathroom was outdoors but of a decent size. The food was in general good and there were lots of choices available. We went for two spa treatments which were of high quality and the spa therapist were very professional. We also booked a hotel car to the airport which was in a nice suv and was competitively priced.

","Unlimited Surprises!!!","Lombok was our trip main destination this time. We spent 5 nights at Qunci Villas. Knowing Lombok is an outlying island, we were not expecting a luxurious stay but clean, neat and comfortable (may be insect-free). It turned out Qunci not only beats all the basic but surprised us in many aspects. SUNSET! We did not notice until the first sunset suddenly dropped in front of me and M. It was stunning! The infinity pool was built in front of this beautiful sunset, and you can guess , it's romantic. Sunsets starts around 5:30pm and make it back to hotel on time.POOL! They have three infinity pools which allows laps. The hotel did make it clear - it is adult pool 160cm in depth. Kids can stay on the side and play. Drinks & food can be served by pool, unlimited clean towels supply.FOOD! We love the hotel food and ate 97% at the hotel. Not only food is delicious but they are very presentable. In fact, Qunci restaurants were packed every night. The Asian restaurant was trying different menu or activities every night so that you wouldn't get bored. My top picks are : hot Cappuccino, chickpea veggie burger, mojito.BREAKFAST! They served a la carte. You can pick different sets base on your no. of guest. The whole breakfast set includes juice, fruits platter, coffee/tea + your choice of main. We love their Parisian basket and healthy option (i.e cereals) They can serve in room , just put the bamboo container and your order outside. If you say 9am, they show up at 8:57am. ROOM! We lived upstairs and ocean front. Pros - fab seaview during the breakfast time. Cons - ocean waves can be really loud and disturb sleep quality. And the room is very simple with basic supplies. I can't say you get a luxurious feeling/experience from the room.SERVICE! Every staff at hotel site will try to make contact and greet. You felt very welcome. Front desk is able to meet and greet professionally and have been very helpful. We were very satisfied throughout our stay. I think every staff deserve credit from it.esp credit goes to the chef and please keep up the creativity!"

The art work at Quinci is outstanding, they even have a gallery. The work of a South African ceramicist is the highlight.

","Stunning Hotel","We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights but would have loved to stay longer, it is simply beautiful! The three pools are incredible with plenty of sunbeds/day beds and umbrellas. Luxurious pool towels provided. Our room was spacious and very clean however for the price we paid it was a little basic - a little re-modernising is needed, however we did not spend much time in our room so this was not an issue. It certainly did not detract from the beauty of this resort and the enjoyment of our stay. The turn down service and mosquito spraying was also much appreciated. The food in the hotel is quite expensive but of very high quality and extremely tasty. We attended the beach BBQ evening which was a delicious and provided a good atmosphere. The breakfast menu was extensive with lots of Indonesian and International options (highly recommend the Nasi Goreng!). Happy hour runs from 5-7pm throughout the hotel, I really appreciated that even though it was 2 for 1, they could offer us two different cocktails instead of the same one twice. The beach is brilliant and sunset is a 'must see'! The beach sellers are persistent but there is a security guard on hand to ensure they do not become a nuisance. All the staff we came into contact with were very friendly and extremely helpful, everyone stopped to say hello which was a very nice touch. We had a truly memorable stay and would hope to return."

","Relaxing, beautiful and private","My husband and I stayed at Qunci for 5 nights in June based on all the fabulous reviews on Trip Advisor, and it did not disappoint. This place is everything you are looking for for a relaxing beach resort holiday. We stayed in a 1 bedroom private pool villa at the back of the resort so it was very private. The room was cleaned twice a day and the housekeeping staff were always friendly. It was a bit noisy at night time though because of three things: (1) we stayed during Ramadan (18 June - 18 July) and so there were nightly readings of the Koran for several hours at a time, and other announcements very early in the morning. (2) the room was right next to the kitchen area so at about 4am we could hear the staff working getting ready for breakfast. (3) the roosters! However this is easily rectified by investing in a good set of earplugs, which we had brought along anyway but the staff are also happy to provide. If you can afford to I would definitely upgrade and get a private villa room, but maybe request one on the south side if you are particularly sensitive to noise. All noise just goes straight through the thatched roofs! We found our room to be very tastefully decorated and the deck/pool area very comforting and relaxing, although it was a shame it did not get any sun at all, but we just used the two main pools instead.The hotel grounds are so beautiful, everything is placed just so, and the gardens are just amazing, everyone was so friendly and happy to help out whenever they could. The restaurant food was very high quality and reasonably priced, although a few more traditional breakfast options would be nice (e.g. cereal/toast). The cocktails, mocktails and juice infusions were all very impressive. The Qunci Bites menu was a bit average.We did the cooking class for 300,000RP each and got to enjoy our creations afterwards and they were absolutely scrumptious and so much of it we couldn't finish it all!! The cooks were super friendly and happy to help answer any questions about the ingredients or process, and we got to keep the recipes which is fantastic because the sate sauce is the most amazing thing I have ever tasted.The spa is also reasonably priced and have a good range of treatments, although they do not have waxing only massage packages and manicure/pedicure. The ladies there are amazingly skilled and I thoroughly enjoyed my 2 hours there one day and 90 mins another!There are three pools, one non-smoking, one free for all and one adults only. We mainly stayed at the non-smoking pool which had great sunshine and also shady palm trees, and with the serenade of the tiny waves breaking on the beach breaking it was just so relaxing I fell asleep! The beach had most beautiful sunsets I've seen in a long time.The whole experience was just so amazing, actually going on holiday and relaxing instead of running around everywhere. It was just what I needed and I never felt rushed or neglected. The ""rubber time"" philosophy is so easy to adopt and while there are plenty of adventure activities to do e.g. (Gili's, Rinjani), Qunci's beauty and abundance of food, pools and privacy made it so easy to just take some time out. It was the best holiday I've had in years!!"

","5 night stay","We had have lovely stay 5 night stay at this resort, and would definitely recommend to any travelers.Positives:Breakfast menu was excellent, providing great variety and consistent quality. In the evening we especially liked the Quali restaurant, and the seafood bbq is a must!Lassies and cocktails were scrumptious - make use of the happy hours between 5-7 and watch the sunset.Infinity pools are pretty spectacular and needed as this isn't the best place to swim in the sea.Outdoor shower, under the night sky was special!!Negatives:Noise - we were staying in a villa close to reception, and were woken up by road noise. We had seen previous posts about hearing the calls to prayer and visiting during Ramadan we experienced this first hand. We were not prepared for how long the calls to prayer take or how loud they could be - we got used to it during our stay but initially we were kept awake. Earplugs could be an idea for those who are a light sleepers. Check in - not enough info - we would have liked detailed breakdown of the resort, what was on offer and trips that could be purchased. On speaking to reception at a later date, options on trips were limited and we decided to use and outside company to facilitate our trips.Tip:Instead of going through the hotel or using a hawker to travel to Gili Trawangan, just book it through a dive company. (We used Dream Divers)They will pick you up, transfer you by fast boat. Much quicker, easier and cheaper."

","Total relaxation","Beautiful resort which offers complete peace and quiet. Rooms are beautifully appointed and lovely outdoor shower. Breakfast is ala carte style - served either at the restaurant or the room. I probably would prefer more options with perhaps some buffet fruits, juices, breads in addition to an ala carte cooked option but no big deal. Restaurant food was good - I preferred the Asian fusion restaurant to the Mediterranean one though which seemed to be heavy on the salt. The spa was good value - husband had a massage and I had a natural facial which was gorgeous. One disappointment was that there was no gym - the beach is relatively short and sand very soft which made running difficult, and the roadside was not safe given the, erm, quality (??) of Indonesia drivers. No tv in the room, so not much to do but laze by the pool and switch off. The rooms are so comfortable, and we slept incredibly well! We did have some miscommunication with concierge over a boat trip we booked which was extremely disappointing for us, however after discussing with the manager, they were very apologetic and were able to resolve the issue. All in all, we had a lovely time, but Lombok was probably a bit 'too' quiet for us and we prefer the dining, accommodation and activity options of Bali."

","Family vacation","Excellent service as usual. All staff are very friendly, helpful & makes you feel so welcome. Relaxing atmosphere & facilities with excellent food and kind arrangements as usual for spare room for showers as our flight is in the evening. It's our fifth time here and we always come back here for a good reason. This time we decided to stay 7 days to soak in more of the relaxed lovely Qunci villas atmosphere. We also snorkelled for the first time at the beach in front and saw a large turtle and anemones with many clownfish. Also explored either ends of the beach where there are rocky outcrops. Beautiful sunsets of the Lombok straits can be seen right from the hotel poolside. We were lucky to catch Bali's Mount Agung volcano during one of the sunsets.We made 2 separate bookings for different room types as that was the only option available at time of reservations. Were allocated a partial garden view room (villa #5) for first night which was quite noisy from the Mosque nearby that had prayers 12am-3am I think and then again at 5am. Somehow the Alang Alang grass roof of the 2nd floor room allows much of the sound to permeate through. Tend to have some insects which come in from the open spaces in the roof eaves. If you are queasy with insects, it's better that you request for ground floor room. However mosquitoes are inevitable in the tropical climate and some fogging with insecticide sprays make it more manageable. Some nights you are spared the mozzies while on other nights you may not be so lucky. Just duck under the bedsheets if one which escaped the fogging bothers you. You will have lots of time to catch up on your sleep during your stay. It's so easy to fall asleep on the bales by the poolside as you listen to the waves. As it was the Ramadan fasting month, the prayers at mosques islandwide seemed more frequent and lasted longer. So we were kind of affected on first night of stay but all was peaceful subsequent nights later as we moved to another villa #32 which is a ground floor room on the other end of the large compound after we called front desk to request for move further from mosque location. So do ask for rooms furthest away from the mosque and you will be fine. Ground floor rooms also have better sound insulation.The 2nd floor rooms will definitely benefit from some effective sound insulation as other guests also had some complaints of mosque noise at night and trouble sleeping. We are ok with the village folks selling bracelets, bands, sarongs and souvenirs at the public beach in front of the hotel, as they are making a living. We always meet them at one corner of the hotel beachfront so as not to disturb other guests and buy quite a lot of stuff from them so that both parties are happy. We are like old friends and there is always a way to banter with them and build a relaxed friendship with the locals, who are always ready with a smile and greeting. Typical island culture but you won't find this so much in Bali now. That's a why we visit Lombok almost annually for the past 11 years. We got a little bored with the food and ventured to Sengigi beach for dinner as well as to Molly's opposite the hotel which has quite good pork ribs. It's owned by a Canadian rigger with his local wife. They serve a good pizza too. Overall the hotel is conveniently located and you can also explore the village behind Molly's where we saw goats and cows and many birds. Our kid loved the village. We like to thank front desk staff for helping pack a birdcage into cardboard box for check in as we have too many hand carry. Love the staff who are the real soul of this hotel. Excellent service from all.... 2 thumbs up from the 3 of us."

","Very nice resort - not sure about the overall value for money","We spent a week at Qunci Villas in June in an Ocean View Room.The room (#23) had a lovely, large balcony with daybed/lounge, table, and a second seat, and due to its position, had uninterrupted views across the pools and the beach.It was beautifully decorated with nice pieces of art and was beautifully maintained on a twice daily basis.Some shortfalls of the room were that there was a) a lack of space for storage of two normal size suitcases - if you didn't want to unpack everything - and the suitcase bench itself was located directly under the hanging space in the open wardrobe, meaning that it was difficult to manouvre clothing without it dragging across the case.b) Internet was intermittent - a problem for all of Lombok - not just the hotel,c) There was no bathtub - unusual for a five star resort, and most importantly,d) The outside shower and partially covered bathroom, which in itself is a nice feature, was poorly designed allowing towels, the toilet, the vanity, and entire floor area to be flooded with water when there was a downpour of rain. Unfortunately this happened to us four days in a row and became relatively dangerous in case of slipping and falling.The hotel management was aware of the issue in this and other similar designed rooms and apparently the architect was to review the roofing near to the bathroom to remedy the situation. We were given a discount of 15% off our bill for these four nights as a ""make good"" but we actually felt sorry for the staff as they continually had to come in, and dry the entire bathroom time and again. Overall the staff were excellent and the food that we had at the hotel was very well prepared and delivered promptly. If you don't want to eat at the hotel all the time there are a few good restaurants nearby and in Sengiigi itself that you could head to. There is also a small Warung (Paradiso) about 100 metres away on the beach that is worth visiting. There are three pools. A non smoking pool, a general pool, and an adults only pool, so plenty of options for keeping cool.In general, we felt that the Qunci was a very nice hotel but not overly sure that it is worth the money we paid for our room (AUD $300 per night after the 15% discount). Therefore we believe the Qunci is very good but certainly not excellent. We travelled with friends who stayed in room 25 and unfortunately they suffered similar issues to ourselves."

","Amazing Luxury Experience","Unbelievable luxury boutique hotel where everything was immaculate. We stayed in a 1 bedroom pool villa and it was modern with beautiful original artwork and a bathroom so unique in style.The food was awesome everyday and the service is unbeatable. Good trips to Gili Islands and South Lombok available.The only slightly disappointing thing was that is was our honeymoon, and whilst they did put flowers in the shape of a heart on our bed, that was it.Even though we weren't really expecting anything we thought it would have been a nice touch to at least acknowledge it a bit more or a bottle of champagne. Otherwise would definitely go back."

Two restaurants and bars of excellent quality. Food is very good and of quite wide selection. We didn't find any disadvantages there. Nice place for calm vacations for couple or family. Swimming in the ocean is possible but not really popular due to coralline. Swimming pools are always available for refreshing. Enough space for all guests. Not crowded. Lovely place :)"

","Amazing stay","We stayed at the partial garden/ocean room in Qunci for 2 nights, and we love it! We did not step out of the villa compound throughout our stay because they have everything we need: 3 swimming pools, 3 restaurants, 1 Spa, a beach where we spent both our evenings watching the amazing sunsets. Let me just say, the sunset at Lombok is even better than Santorini's, with the majestic Mount Agung popping out at the horizon on a clear evening sky. The dinners at the beach at night was amazing, although it was too dark to see what we are actually eating. The room was just 20 metres away from the pool, with a nice veranda to chill with a glass of wine and a book. The staff are friendly and interactive. The price, I reckon, is a little on the high side, but I guess this is what you are paying for: comfort, service and amazing views. Will I be back again? Maybe I would like a different place just to compare, a place nearer to Sengigi main town perhaps. But Qunci is definitely making the other competitors sweat."

","Relaxing holidays","We stayed in Qunci Villa for 7 days and we really enjoyed our stay. We definitely liked the atmosphere in each room and enjoyed the outdoor bathroom. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The food is really good and cheap. I didnt really like the beef rendang stew but thats my taste.. except this all others dishes were good. The breakfast is my favorite.. if you get the view on the sea then its really amazing. Regarding the room, we had a seaview room for 2 adults, 2 kids.. its a bit small so next time we will change for the double room villa. Also the pool is not really adapted to small kids but if your children are used to this kinda hotel they will be just fine in the pool for swimming not playing.In term of activities, we missed the fitness but we did some hiking and swimming, snorkeling and cycling (good to know that hotel can arrange cycling trips) so overall we definitely will be back in Lombok and we have no reason to go to another resort. See you soon Qunci Villa :-)"

","Magical!","We stayed for four nights in Qunci Villas in June 2015 and had an absolutely wonderful experience. Room - we spent time in two different rooms during our stay, and both were great. We were in a ground floor ocean-view villa for the first 3 nights, and transferred to a second-floor (UK first floor) ocean-view villa for the final night (we were interested in how the upper level rooms would be, so asked if there was any chance of moving - the staff were very happy to accommodate our request at no extra cost and helped move our luggage). The ground floor room was lovely, the highlight being the bathroom area, which was outdoor (but very private) and had a little garden with shrubs and a Japanese-style lantern, with a palm tree growing up through the wooden ceiling - very atmospheric! The room had a veranda with comfortable seating and looked out over the pool and ocean.The second-floor room had a lovely vaulted beamed ceiling, with a large balcony and absolutely spectacular views over the pools and ocean. The outdoor bathroom here was less green but very attractive, with stone slabs and unobstructed views up to the stars at night. Both rooms were spotlessly clean, and beds were turned down nightly, with fresh flowers spread out on the bed and around the room. Lovely!Wi-Fi was also great. Food - we had breakfast on our balconies every day, and it was - without fail - delicious. Fantastic to have this delivered to you every morning. There is a wide choice of breakfasts that you can order on a form to fill out on the prior evening, which you leave outside your door. The fresh fruit and juices were particularly delicious, and good coffee. The lunch options from the bar near the pool were reasonably priced, with good portions and tasty food. We ate at the hotel restaurant on one of the evenings - again, portions were very generous, and the food was well presented and tasty. The deserts were also great - on a couple of nights we had dessert after eating out in Sengiggi and sat down by the ocean while we ate it - really nice seating options. Good range of drinks from the bar as well.Pools and location - the location is simply stunning - on a beautiful swimming beach, which is lovely to walk along, and the entire frontage of the hotel has unobstructed views out across the Lombok Straits to Gunung Agung volcano on Bali. The sunsets are spectacular, and just being able to look out over the distant volcano cone while you're swimming in one of the three infinity pools is really special. The pools themselves are tastefully designed and nicely laid out, so that you never feel the poolside area is overly crowded. The grounds are lovingly maintained and have a nice tropical feel, although they can be a bit tricky to navigate! Overall a really beautiful property. Spa - we made use of the spa for one of the traditional Lombok full-body massages and really enjoyed it. It's not cheap, but service is excellent and the surroundings are pristine. The team from the spa occasionally circulate the pool area giving out complimentary head and shoulder massages, too, which is great! Beach - the beach is lovely, with golden sand and crystal clear water. It's a nice walk along to the cliffs at the end, and when the tide is high you can swim in the water. Although bettered by the beaches on the Gilis and the southern part of the island (Selong Balanak and Mawun are stunning), it's a lovely beach to have such easy access to, and to wake up to every morning! On an additional point, several of the reviews have mentioned that the vendors/hawkers on the beach can be irritating - we didn't find this to be the case. Although they're almost always present on the beach, they are polite and don't hassle you if you make it clear you're not interested. We didn't find them to be an intrusion.Trips - we went on one of the private boat trips to the Gili islands through the hotel, which was a great day out. A bit pricey, but it saved the stress of negotiating Bangsal harbour, which we did on another day, and found to be horrendous - so confusing and full of opportunistic touts (obviously they're just trying to make a living, but we found ourselves in a couple of quite unpleasant situations, with the touts being very rude). The guide on the trip was great, and Qunci provided towels, water and snorkeling gear. Service - the staff were universally excellent, and really went out of their way to help. Very friendly, polite, informative and with great English. Overall we really couldn't fault our experience at Qunci, and hope to be able to return before too long for another stay. Thanks to the staff for making our stay so pleasant!PS. We stayed as a gay couple, and had no issues whatsoever - the staff did not bat an eyelid and were always very friendly and accommodating to us."

","One of the nicest hotel in Sengigi","Stayed 4 nights in Qunci Villa in their partial ocean view villa. Staffs were friendly and speak good English. Outdoor bathroom which can be windy and cool if you plan to take a shower at night but you will be greeted with starry night! Even though we stayed further away from the community mosque, we were still awaken by the prayer from the mosque at 4am every morning! Hotel staff tried to offer help by providing us ear plug but we declined. Only 2 restaurants and 1 bar in the hotel that served the same lunch menu. Dinner were either Mediterranean or Thai. Tried 2 lunches and 1 dinner at the Mediterranean rst. Portion was still okay.Their breakfast are served in room or in the restaurant which you can choose from 12 types of breakfast set. Still prefer the international buffet style breakfast. A little bit hiccup during the checkout where they charged us for a la cart breakfast item which we didnât ordered. Their spa is priced in USD and 3-4 times higher than those spa outside Sengigi. Tried their Balinese massage which is very good to soothe tiring back and shoulder or maybe the masseuae did a very good job? Also tried their Qunci Jet Lag spa package that offered 50% discount from 8-11am daily. I will definitely give a miss and rather pay more for other massages. There's another new hotel/resort coming up near the Malibu Beach which can be considered if we are coming back to Lombok"

","Not a place for a good night sleep :(","I stayed in unit 70 with my family. Maybe it's situated near the kitchen of the restaurants, noises could be heard occasionally, sometimes loud. The worst was in the middle of the night when the loud prayers of the nearby mosque could really wake you up! Another thing they need to improve is the housekeeping (certain basic amenities were not replenished).Otherwise, the hotel is beautiful, food is good & the staff are friendly."

","It was an amazing stay!","First time to Lombok & was greeted by warm smiles upon check-in! Room was great: Turn down service every night for mosquito spray (odour-less) & room well-cleaned everyday! Booked a 4 night Ocean View Room & was offered the first-storey room with views of the ocean as well as deck & pool. Asked if we could change it to the upper storey & the staff managed to switch 2 nights of our rooms for the upper storey. Couldn't ask for better service!Food special every other day & happy-hour during 5pm to 7pm everyday!: Joined in their BBQ night dinner on Weds & their Indonesian Pasar Malam Food dinner on Friday! Had great fun dining alongside the ocean (really seems like a candle-lit dinner!) And yes, you hear me right, there's happy hour during 5pm to 7pm. So we order our cocktails & liqueurs before the dinner starts at 7pm :DSpa: Tried the Late Check Out R&R treatment, it was a very soothing & relaxing one. Albeit a little expensive, but you def are paying for the service & treatment! (the best you can imagine) But I was a little uncomfortable cos we booked couple spa and the male therapist was assigned to my bf which just seemed a little inappropriate. It could be their culture that only male therapists attend to guys. Staff was so hospitable & genuine! You are literally living like a King & Queen! They asked about your day, your food and how they can make it better for you! Would def come back for more! Thanks!"

You can't fault it.The hotel itself is new, with a lovely Indonesian style, really beautiful, just on the beach with amazing infinity pools. Our room was great, with an awesome semi-outdoor bathroom (completely private).The included breakfast was from another word. The hotel has different restaurants, so a break from Asian food is possible (Asian food also available of course).Staff are always happy to help, to get you anything you need/want (organising a scooter to be delivered at reception for you, is just an example).And the view, wow, from the restaurant terrace or from the pools, looking at the sea, with Bali and its Mount Agung in the background is the perfect scenery for sunset, romantic dinner, or relaxing time."

","Even better this time around at Qunci","We've just returned after a wonderful week at Qunci. Having stayed here six years ago, we were really looking forward to returning, this time with a toddler in tow. The week was amazing. Qunci has grown in size since our last visit but it still has the care and attention of a smaller boutique style hotel. Staff were incredible, courteous and helpful at all times. They remembered our names and played with our daughter. They'll all go out of their way to help and service you. The pools are beautify and the restaurants lovely. The quality of food was amazing. The lunch menu alone is impressive and really reasonable. We stayed in pool villa for this trip and it was a great experience and worth the upgrade. Nice to have a little privacy and space to ourselves. Thanks again Qunci. We'll be back again."

","Honeymoon in Lombok","I'm currently sitting on my sun lounger at Qunci Villas surrounded by lush palms and the blue sea and I'm wondering why Qunci doesn't have 5 stars?! Our stay has been almost perfect and I really am picking the smallest things to 'complain' about because this place really is idylic! Our room- villa number 57, a second floor, sea view room. It's very spacious, the bed is huge (a super king I think), we have a lovely, comfortable balcony and an open air bathroom which is also spacious. We are provided with all the extras you could possibly think of from toothbrush to shaving kit and cotton buds, lovely shower gel, shampoo/conditioner and the usuals like a hair dryer and safe. We are also provided with an electric mozzie killer! I can't fault the room at all! Maid service everyday, towels changed daily and the turn down service complete with daily 'fogging' to kill any Mosquitos (which by the wa we didn't see any of).As I said the surroundings are beautiful- three pools, one being a 'smoke free' pool which is nice, 1 small bar, 2 restaurants and a spa on site. The prices at the restaurants and the bar are very reasonable, we were spending around Â£50 on a 3 course meal for both of us including wine at the hotel restaurants and the food was of very good quality. The lunch menu had Indonesian specials as well as your usual baguettes and burgers which we're priced around Â£5. The bar was lovely for 'sundowners' and offered at 2 hour 'happy hour' from 5-7 which included their delicious cocktails on a 2 for 1 offer.We visited the spa one afternoon and enjoyed an hour long couples massage which was heavenly and was so cheap at around Â£25. Now, when I really really think about it and I hope Qunci use this as constructive criticism and nothing more, there were just 4 faults I can think of that would have made our stay that bit more perfect....1. Breakfast- the eggs were never properly cooked through making them slimy and watery2. One evening my husband wasn't feeling well so wanted an early night leaving me to do my own thing- I opted for a bottle of wine and a burger on the balcony and a trashy magazine (not wanting to eat a full meal on my own in the restaurant). I ventured downstairs to the restaurant around 6pm and asked if a burger would be possible but I was told it wasn't because they stop the lunch time menu at 5.30. I then went to the bar and asked for some tapas but again, this menu had stopped also. It would be great if the lunch time menu continued into the evening as I think you do tend to get a bit bored with eating a full 'posh' meal every night, even though the food is delicious! 3. I know we're honeymooners but that doesn't mean we're boring and want to go to bed at 10pm! EVERYTHING shuts at 10, no restaurants, no bars nothing! It would be great if the bar stayed open even until midnight with some good music playing to cater for those who want a bit more of an atmosphere? 4. The Romantic meal- my sister in law had bought us this as a surprise which we decided to have on our last night. Not great. It's a set menu of 5 courses and a bottle of wine. The surroundings were lovely, in a beach front pagoda, crisp white table linen, rose petals on the floor, lovely but the food was no where near as good as the restaurant food- we couldn't even decide if the 1st course was fish or chicken! If they created a set menu from the food they already do in the restaurants it would have been perfect. A little tip if you're going to book the romantic meal- there are 3 pagodas to choose from, 2 of them are VERY public so unless you want an audience when you eat go for the one at the far end of the beach furthest away from the bar- this way you won't have any passers by! We only ventured into Sengiggi twice as the food at Qunci was so good we didn't feel the need to go out for dinner. To be brutally honest, it wasn't great! Everywhere seemed to be empty apart for 'Happy Cafe' which was indeed HAPPY! What a place- think Indonesian karaoke/Blackpool/everything you didn't think you wanted for your honeymoon but it was so much fun and nice to go somewhere with a bit more life!!  Other than a trip into Sengiggi which is about 2 miles away, there are two bars right next to Qunci- the Verve which opened in Jan 2015 (so not in any guide books) is literally a minutes walk up the beach behind Qunci's NooQ bar. It has it's own pool, decent beach front views and nice wine (very important!). Again, not a busy place bit I think once it gets a reputation it will do well. The other hidden gem is the 'Nuff said' warung another minutes walk past the verve. This rustic little place is a perfect spot for a cold beer whilst the sun sets. It's is essentially a little shack and perhaps not to everyone's tastes but we thought it was lovely! Another thing to mention- there are hawkers on the beach which will try and sell you something. Please bear in mind these people are only trying to make an honest living so try not to get annoyed with them. They're nice people and if you are polite and just exchange pleasantries they'll move on.Happy holidays!!"

","Best hotel on Lombok","Stayed for 12 nights in this wonderful boutique hotel in Lombok. It's on the Coast with Bali volcano on the horizon. Food is great but can sometimes be heavy on the flavours. That said, when I complained about a one particular meal they bout me an alternative and gave us the dinner for free. The only other thing that let the hotel down was a load of workman building a new pagoda between the two pool areas. Two weeks of hammering and sawing was not what we expected. Rooms are fabulous! Went to the Gili Islands for a day. Exceptional diving! Also hired a taxi for the day to explore the North of the island before the developers move in."

","Excellent but...","Spent 3 nights at Qunci with the whole family, 8 adults and 3 young kids, and we booked 4 rooms. The hotel is nicely located in a more quiet area of Senggigi, the Mangsit beach. Landscaping is very nice while beach side pools, there are 3 of them, are also super nice, great for relaxing and taking some laps. The beach is nice for walking and some dipping. Staffs were also friendly and helpful. Restaurants, there are 2, are excellent for breakfast and dinner and price, I think is reasonable for its quality and location. You cant really beat breakfast and dinner on the beach.Now the but parts...some minor details...- Not really kids friendly...all pools are 160cm deep. Stairs to 2nd floor had no railing in some parts and rather steep.- Bathrooms on the 2nd floor of the villas are rather small and have no shower hose. Shower box is open and as a result water spills all over the place. Bathrooms are also rather dark as lighting come from bathroom mirror only. "

","Wonderful experience","We stayed at Quinci for one night on our way to the Gili isles after my colleague recommended it to me. I was so impressed with so many things about this place it's hard to know where to start! As we were travelling around Indonesia we were pushed for time so could only stay one night but if I could have stayed longer I would have. The bungalow was very cool with a huge contemporary painting in the bedroom and the bathroom had a very nice outdoor shower. All we had to do was walk a few steps from the bungalow until we were on the beach or their incredible infinity pools. Even though the beach was close, I found myself not wanting to leave my sunlounger! There was a happy hour at 5 with fantastic cocktails and great service.We had dinner in the restaurant on the beach consisting of fried frogs legs and a seafood curry and I would highly recommend it."

","Nice spot but spoilt by Indonesians selling their stuff all day long","We spent 3 nights in a ocean view room. This place could be a very nice place but some facts made our experience a bit disappointing. 1)Room is a bit poor, not as good as expected, seems pretty old. The aircon was not working very well as it shut down itself after 30min : as you can imagine, the first night was difficult. The hotel fixed it the next day. The ocean view is poor, as the room is located behind the swimming pool which is in front of the sea. You don't enjoy the ocean view, just the pool view with deckchairs and parasols. You can spot the sea between all of this.2) the swimming pool area is very nice. Spot is lovely, infinity pools are nice, where you can enjoy the view on Bali and the sunset. But what is very annoying is the continuous visits of local Indonesians who are here to sell you their stuff or snorkeling trip to Gili. They start their show from the breakfast and sell all day long till dawn, they even speak to you when you are resting on deckchair or swimming in the pool. For the price you pay, you don't want to be disturbed like this. It is simply unbearable. The hotel guard don't say a word, he should at least ask them to walk on the beach and not just in front of the hotel area. I know that people already mentioned this in some of their Tripadvisor reviews, but this is not excuse (I have read some replies from the hotel to these reviews, come on, we don't travel across the world to be considered as walking wallets by these very annoying people, we want to rest, peacefully).3) the breakfast is poor and light, juices are not very good. A buffet would have been appreciated."

","Fantastic resort in Lombok","We just came back from our second visit to Qunci, this time staying for 5 nights. Again, Qunci never fails to be anything short of fantastic. The reason that we came back was the high level of service we receive from the staff, most of who remembered us from last time. They are all so lovely and extremely helpful. We stayed in an Ocean View Room (50) was next to the Quali restaurant. The room was a good size, with a balcony overlooking the ocean and main pool. My only one criticism was that our shower was completely outdoors, which is fine, I donât mind. However, whilst we were there it rained quite a few times, and the rain bucketed onto our bathroom floor, making it completely slippery and quite dangerous to walk on. We used the Qamboja spa this time, my husband and I both having two massages, a facial and a mani and pedi. All experiences were great, no complaints at all â Iâd highly recommend utilising the spa.We didnât leave the resort once at all during our time there. With the high standard of food and drinks and three restaurants to choose from, thereâs really no need to go anywhere else. Any cuisine of food, whether itâs Asian or Western they do well. We definitely made the most of the two for one cocktail happy hour from 5pm-7pm. Qunci also offers âthemedâ dinners in case you get tired of their normal menu. We participated in the Indonesian Market Night and the Spanish night. Both again were great. There werenât as many people as we thought attending these nights, I did find that they really werenât advertised very much, so Iâm not sure if this was the reason. The Spanish night for instance we didnât know about until late afternoon that day, I will say though that paella and free flow sangria was excellent, oh and the churros!Breakfast is a a carte, which I find so much better than a standard buffet. The kitchen was happy to make changes if needed and there was a great variety of mostly western dishes. Breakfast by the ocean every day is just spectacular.There are three pools to choose from, the main pool, a smoke free pool and an adults only pool. None of the pools were overcrowded, and there were always plenty of beds available which were all well tended by the staff there.Overall another fantastic experience at Qunci, we canât wait to come back."

","I don't know how anyone could rank Quinci at less than very good! ","I usually wait till till I've completed my stay before leaving a review. I'm currently here for a 5 night stay and we are loving it. The layout of this resort is very well thought out. We especially love the pools and thoroughly enjoyed our first breakfast this morning over looking the ocean. What a treat! Unfortunately my husband has been a bit unwell from the first leg of our trip, but staff were so helpful in going out and getting medicines and offering to organise a doctor. Of course we have to pay for the service but the helpfulness and concern of the staff is really appreciated. And the food.... The quality of the food is amazing!"

Staff is very friendly and helpfull. Located at the beach you can enjoy a beautiful sunset each day from the pool area. After sunset, the beach is lighted so you can still se the beach and the waves when it is dark. It is beautiful! The resort also has an effective anti-musquito treatment to minimize them bugging you.

","Qunci Villa is so relevant in all ways","I'm going to write this review while I am still at the villa...we've been to Bali like numerous time but never in Lombok..so this time around we decided to give Lombok a try.Intially our travel agent suggested a different villa as one of the criteria is it has to be 3 br by the beach...but after reading a rave review about Qunci Villa we asked our agent to change.It was the best decision. As we are family of 7 ,Qusia Villa is perfect for us. It is located on top the hills with a beautiful sunset view and Mount Agung in the distant.The villa is decorated to the finest with a collection of beautiful art pieces. However my small children ( 4 and 10 ) are not really a fan of the big statues and big potrait paintings. Our butler Munzir and Adin are so very helpful and attentive attended to our needs. The villa is equipped with full kitchen , state of the art gym ( no excuse not to exercise ), tv room , open living and dining. Actually I am out of superlatives words to describe how fantastic this villa is. You can choose to either to have breakfast at the main resort or at the villa. The selection if breakfast is pretty is varieties from middleeastern, continental to english breakfast. All are halal and no pork served.The private beach is just stunning with a clear blue water. So you have the best of both world..the serenity of the hills and fun on the beach.The staffs at the reception are very friendly and helpful. It may be our first but definitely will not be the last...IA."

","Perfect Honeymoon experience with the best staff in the world!","Thinking of booking a stay at Qunci? Don't think any more and just book it, you won't regret it!I stayed at Qunci with my husband on our honeymoon for 10 days and were impressed by almost everything that Qunci had to offer. Our first impression was from their airport transfer service which whisked us away from the crowds at the airport, into a comfortable AC car and were given ice cold face towels and bottled water - after 1 1/2 days travelling this was VERY needed. Upon arriving at the hotel we were greeted with delicious ice cold welcome drinks and face towels, a porter took our bags to the room and off we went. All of the amazing service we'd received so far continued throughout our entire stay with staff friendly and chatty, willing to go above and beyond (for example bringing us ice water and face towels one afternoon while we waited for our lunch after we'd mentioned that it was a very hot day to us).  Our room, a partial ocean view (number 76) was ideal for us as it was upstairs, set back by one row from the pools and main walkways but still close enough that we could see the sea from our bed. The room was immaculate and exactly as the photos show on their website. Complimentary bottled water each day was a nice touch and a fruit basket and fresh flowers being left in the room were such exciting surprises! The rooms are also turned down twice a day and never once disturbed us while we were in the room - incredible! And the outdoor bathroom is a fantastic experience, especially having a shower by moonlight. The rest of the grounds, pool and restaurant areas were immaculate with the hard work of their attentive staff. Normally when I stay somewhere based on their photos they are somewhat a let down compared to the reality but Qunci is perhaps even better than their photos. The pool areas have plenty of loungers with fresh towels always available and the views over the sea and infinity pools are amazing. Lunch, snacks and drinks can be brought to you there as well which is well worth a try - happy hour 5-7pm every day while watching the sun set behind Bali is out of this world beautiful. Further to this the food is absolutely fabulous! All their restaurants are brilliant and we ate there so much and had the best food of our whole trip here. I must also recommend all their chocolate desserts - delicious (I had some every day!). Both western and local cuisine is brilliant.  With all of the positives above the most impressive was the staff who really could not have made our stay more special. Friendly, chatty and they would literally come running to help you, for example with putting up a sun umbrella or to tuck your chair in. A few of the staff even remembered our names and what we had or would be doing that day - a special thank you to Andy, Tia, Ayu and Husni to name just a few of the staff. Qunci can pride themselves on the service they're able to offer through their staff. At the end of our stay we had their 'Romantic Dinner' which was one of the best experiences I have ever been lucky enough to have. Our personal butler Husni set up a table right near the beach surrounded with flowers and a heart of petals on the floor around our table. It was so special - yes it was pricey ($155) but we feel it was well worth it. And thank you Husni! In conclusion I can't champion this hotel enough and wish we could have stayed longer. I have been very lucky to stay in some very nice hotels over the world, including Marriots and for me nothing has come to close to the details and joy this hotel has to offer. Thank you Qunci for making our honeymoon perfect!"

","Wonderful hotel","We booked a good deal on an early bird price discount. We were given a ground floor Garden room. The room was not very big but it had a comfortable king size bed and could accommodate another single bed and baby cot for our 2 boys. The bathroom was huge but most of the space was wasted by the outdoor pebble decor. No complaints on the room other than there was no TV at all. TV junkies will have find another resort but we were fine. The resort had 3 pools. But unfortunately all pools were 1.6m deep which meant that we could not let the boys play on their own. It would have been better if they had converted one of the pools to be a shallow kids pool. Service was excellent and staff were friendly. Instead of buffet breakfast served in large hotel, we were given a wide choice of ala carte choices served ready made. The servings were adequate. We are in the restaurants for a couple of meals. Whilst we thought they dinner was good, we did not enjoy one of the lunch as much. But overall the experience in this resort was excellent. But I think families with young children might need to reconsider if they were looking for kid friendly swimming pools. "

","Just what we needed for a RELAXING honeymoon :)","The service at Qunci Villa was just top notch!!! They ensured all our needs are taken care of, from arrival to departure. Just walking around the beautiful compound, staff will be around to ask if they can help in any way. They offer a choice of having breakfast in your room or at the restaurant, which was a great touch :) For one of the breakfast we ordered, it contained pesto and my wife was allergic to nuts. All we needed was one phone call, and the staff happily replaced the dish with a new one minus the pesto. Really appreciated that :)Another quality of Qunci Villa was the stunning view of Gunung Agung that it offers. The place was clean, gardens well maintained which certainly provided the classy feel to the place.Great place to stay for sure! :D"

The location and infinity pools are stunning - with a great sunset view. There's not much in the immediate vicinity of the hotel in terms of restaurants or shops and nearby town caters mainly for backpackers but we had good food in all three restaurants. Also booked a cycle tour with lombokbikingtour.com which was a great way to see some of the island."

","16 days of bliss","Absolutely loved 16 days at Qunci villas. This is a small resort which was staffed by great locals and a few not at all helpful non locals. If you enjoy absolute beachfront, fantastic food with an indonesian continental mix and great spa treatments you'll love Qunci Villas. We tried a few rooms -garden view, partial Seaview, Seaview and 1 room pool villa. The Seaview room was a favourite as sitting up on the veranda in the evenings listening to the sea and falling asleep to that slow crash of surf is idyllic. At one stage I thought we might watch TV and had one put in our room, but we never even turned it on. Life at Qunci slows quickly.We ate most meals at Qunci and didn't find anything in town as good. The manager of the restaurants was brilliant. He made sure he spoke with us each meal and shared much of himself and the local culture. The staff working for him were all great and it was good to have the trainees involved. The head chief was around a lot and his menus were fantastic in all restaurants at all times of day. The food is very well priced.We made the most of daily massages overlooking the beach and treatments in the spa. They were so well priced and the local products lovely.We walked on the beach and swam and snorkelled, but this could be challenging depending on the tides. The pools were beautiful and so we sat by the pool reading and looking out to sea.Qunci Villas is a cheap holiday compared to hotels of the same quality in Bali and there is no hassle and overcrowding. Enjoy a quiet break."

","Yikes- Probably wont stay here again","Let me start with the three positive things I have to say: 1) the property is beautiful and wonderfully situated right on the beach and 2) SOME of the staff were very very nice. 3) The owner seemed cool by email. Now...all the things that made this place stressful. 1) Communication was very poor via email. As solo female coming all the way from New York, I wanted to be able to plan a little in advance for things like airport transfers and excursions, but getting the hotel staff to respond was no easy task. 2) My first hotel room had a broken door. That's right- broken. As in it wouldn't shut or lock. They called the engineers who ""fixed"" it, which meant propping it closed with a big gaping hole between the doors. Mind you- this is a tropical place with plenty of bugs- you want your doors to shut. After complaining to the hotel manager who agreed the door was unfixable, she moved me to another room. But ONLY after it was clear I was angry-she should have offered right away. 3) Not all the staff were that friendly. It was about 50/50. Now the final straw- upon my arrival, I was booked a beachside table at their restaurant by the hotel manager. The night of my reservation, the restaurant tried to tell me I could no longer have the table as a larger party wanted the beachside. I threw a hissy fit and then they magically found me a different beachside table. It was almost as though they though they could push me around because I am a single female. All in all, this hotel was extremely spotty and stressful. I regret not just booking at the Oberoi or some other place I could have been guaranteed service for not that much more money. Actually- the money is almost meaningless, as far as I am concerned. I would rather pay more for good service. I booked at Qunci because I wanted to give a new place a try and now I am sorry I did that. Thankfully my next hotel is an Oberoi- I'll need them to decompress from this hotel stay."

","Qunci quality","six days languishing in the luxury offered at Qunci Villas was like a month in heaven. Located directly across the strait from sacred Mt Agung in Bali, and visible every day especially at spectacular sunset, Qunci is the epitome of the best experience in a tropical setting. Located on a gorgeous beach with local outrigger fishing boats coming and going all day, 3 massive pools (one adults only), delicious food and drink for your selective pleasure, luxury villas and lovely, happy, accomodating staff. The spa complex is world class. An added touch of the unexpected is stunning ceramic art by renowned South African artist, Hennie Meyer, that is very generously placed around the complex. Sadly none are available for purchase---a good reason to holiday in S Africa, really. A lot of new development happening in Lombok but the key to your best holiday is Qunci Villas."

","A Little Piece of Heaven!","We could remember as if it was just yesterday. Bali was an amazing cultural experience and could be sensory overwhelming for those who never been there before. So I was determined to search for a villa, boutique style hotel to unwind and did nothing but that. I discovered the Qunci Villas by accident and took a chance. I was glad I took it because everyone was overly impressed and had a wonderful 2-night stay! It was beautiful, modern, chic, super private, and right at the ocean. Its location is quite secluded so prepare to take taxi everywhere. The breakfast overlooking the ocean at the open-air restaurant was amazing. Infiniti pool was totally sublime. Villas were heavenly and clean. We found out later on that itâs also gay-friendly. Thank you for wonderful memories and please keep up the great property + services, Qunci Villas!"

","If it wasent for Tugu then Qunci would win","Having stayed at various resorts on the island, Qunci seems to be missing that special Lombok touch... But perhaps this has to do with its size... Qunci is definitely a non personal resort.... hundreds of rooms set in a maze of passageways... that said the staff were nice, friendly and helpful... There was an incident where a pair of flip flops went missing form my balcony.... I was not greatly concerned but mentioned it to reception encase they turned up.... Although the hotel seemed to take it very seriously... so seriously they called the police who came and searched the resort and my room interviewing various staff who could of entered.... a little unnecessary but I suppose they were only trying.... Would I stay again? I think I would... But hands down The TUGU Hotel has to be my favorite on Lombok.... I have stayed at some top hotels, but the service, surroundings, location and staff of The TUGU will always, with out fail, exceed your expectations.... Qunci on the other hand... its dose what it says on the tin."

We were on honeymoon so splashed out but ended up hanging at the resort every day and coming down for breakfast. So don't waste money on the villa.

","Good place to stay - but family with toddlers will need a little more","Quinci (pronounced Kunci, meaning key in Bahasa Indonesia) is a really nice place to stay. We stayed at room 8, over looking the beach, amazing view and friendly staff. The only few things is that, having a 3 year old in tow, and having to get him to sleep in the afternoon proved slightly difficult due to the room being a little hot. It only has one 1 horse-powered aircond (no fan in the toilet, or the balcony) - plenty enough for a cool day in the room, but on the few days we had here, we asked them to bring in a stand fan because it was just too warm. Even the stand fan did not have any cover on, so it was quite dangerous to turn on (when you have a kid looking to touch everything and anything) and we ended up sparingly. Other than that, recommended place to stay. Quinci - recommend to have at least a 1.5 or 2 hp aircond for your large rooms, or standby fans. Or a fan in the bathroom or the balcony. Otherwise, this would have been an excellent rating."

We had a partial sea view room (more privacy than the ones right at the front) which was lovely. There are 3 infinity pools overlooking the sea which is lit up at night. And the grounds are truly beautiful. Definitely a place for romantics! The staff are very attentive. The menus at the 3 restaurants are a bit limited for vegetarians but they were happy to accommodate meal changes. Note that the food quickly notches up with all the taxes but it is really good quality and you can also eat in Sengiggi (5 min taxi ride away) if you're on a bit of a budget. If you can, splurge on a treatment or two in the spa - very well trained staff and fab natural ingredients (eg tomato and olive oil cleanser, chocolate mask etc etc). You catch my drift..."

","in paradise :-)","we stayed at the qunci villas for 8 nights and just loved it. we have travelled the world over the past 15 years and have only seen very, very few places like qunci villas. still daydreaming about our stay :-) hopefully, it will not be our last visit to qunci villas :-)great staff, fantastic atmosphere by day and night, delicious food and the best bloody mary ever. highly appreciated the use of fresh ingredients for drinks, etc. (e.g. fresh tomatoes, pineapple, sugarcane, local honey).the most impressive part about qunci villas: the hotel is even better, than what the fantastic pictures on the the hotel website promise you. usually, the pictures on an official hotel website do not reflect the reality anymore and cannot live up with its promises by far.congrats to qunci villas that you can do better than your promises!"

","5 star","While in Bali friends reccomended we stay at the Quincy on Lombok . So glad they did .We hopped on a plane flew over .Would not go over on a boat when the plane flight over at the time was only $40.The rooms gardens pool and the view outstanding . My wife joked saying Brad Pitt or George Clooney would walk around the corner .Quincy villas super modern but Lombok the Island is like Bali 25/30 years ago .Hardly untouched by tourism .Very quiet but awesome to explore .Things will change with the new airport and the new road from the airport to Sengiggi .You will notice a large Muslim influence on the Island from the dress to the praying every 4/5 hours ."

The efficiency and care taken by the staff was exemplary. This continued for our entire stay. Such a pleasant and welcome surprise.

","Fantastic stay at Qunci Villas","My husband and I stayed at the Qunci Villas with some friends for 6 nights.We had a fantastic stay and can't fault the resort at all.Service - amazing from all staff, especially the restaurant/bar staff. Everyone was extremely helpful and friendlyHotel and grounds are beautiful, especially the pool areas, everything makes you feel relaxed as soon as you arrive, and there is nothing better to than sipping a cocktail by the pool and watching the amazing sunsets.The partial ocean view room was great, with a beautiful spacious balcony and outdoor bathroom. Having an ocean view means being closer to the restaurants but we did not have any issues with noise. Location is great, on a small beach, so there are not many beach vendors, and only about 5 minutes drive from Sengiggi, where you can find plenty of bars and restaurants.There is a little shop across the road and you can book day trips to the Gili islands or rent a scooter directly from the beach vendors. (best way to get around Lombok)The hotel also puts on various events during the week, we had a BBQ night, Spanish night and a traditional Balinese dance night, so there is plenty of entertainment if you need.The food and drinks at the resort were amazing. We loved all 3 restaurants, especially the Happy Hour every afternoon, trying more or less all the cocktails on the menu.There are also some delicious non-alcoholic options, like home-made iced teas and sugarcane and fruit juice infusions.The only small criticism I have is regarding the billing of the room. We booked online under a 20% off special which was said to be ""instant payment"", so I assumed payment would be processed at that time.When we arrived at the hotel nothing was mentioned, however, I realised the next day that I was charged the full amount that day. When I checked with reception they assured me that the payment did not go through twice, and that they always process it on arrival, even if you book the instant rate online.This created some issues with my credit card, as I had not budgeted for such a large sum to be charged. Had I known I would have used a different card on check-in.This is just a small issue, but I would recommend the staff explain this on check-in, or to change the wording on the website to avoid confusion.As a travel agent I will definitely recommend this resort to my clients, and I hope to return someday myself.Thank you Qunci Villas for an amazing holiday!"

","A few improvements and this would be paradise!","We stayed here for 10 nights in April for our honeymoon. We'd never travelled so far before or spent so much money on a holiday so this was a really big deal for us and the trip of our lives. Upon arrival at Qunci villas we were really impressed. ~Pro's~ The staff can't do enough to help you. Some of them even try to remember your names and your likes. There are about 5 staff in particular which really stood outThe attention to detail is admirable. The little flowers in the towels, the constant monitoring of the pool areas, the landscaping, gardening and room cleaning. I was really impressed. The grounds were beautiful and everywhere was something beautiful to photographThe cocktails were fantastic - if only happy hour went on for longer! The private pool was a lovely treat - only it didn't seem that clean after 10 days so we used the main poolsOutdoor shower a really luxury - really missing that now we're homeThe food was outstanding, many times my husband wanted to stay in the hotel as we preferred the foodThe romantic meal was a real treat. Very expensive but the food and wine and settings were outstanding. One of the highlights of our honeymoon. The spa - our treatments were fantastic. We enjoyed the couples spa package and felt really revived after it. Such a beautiful spa! ~ Cons ~Our private pool villa didn't have any sun post 10am so if we wanted some sunshine we had to head to the pool -something you don't know when you check in the night before and then unpack so it's too late to switchThe 'honeymoon benefits package' of orchid flowers in the room were removed the next morning (we didn't arrive until the evening) so didn't really feel like we got any sort of honeymoon perksThe mosque seemed to be next door or very close as we were kept awake from 5am onwards.Some mornings the drums and noise went on for hours (If you're reading this.. pack your ear plugs and you'll be fine!) I appreciate we must respect local culture and religion when visiting a Muslim country Beach sellers - this was really off-putting. We wouldn't go onto the beach or even use the loungers near the pool as we didn't feel we could relax and or enjoy the view due to the constant hassle. We also struggled to get any nice pictures or sunset shots due to the hawkers constantly waving at us. I agree with previous reviews that some stalls in a designated area may help both guests and the locals. Wifi - really good when it worked but had to constantly reconnect every 10 minutes (not a major issue we realise and still a luxury to have it all over the hotel)Check out - the young lady was in training adn the whole area was a bit hectic but the check out experience wasn't that smooth. There was no mention of our 10 day stay or conversation on feedback or anything. We were given our 17million bill and that was that. We then waited 2 hours for our transfer (in the heat) and left. Checkouts leave lasting impressions so some work could be done here especially after we've been there for 10 days. Management - the hotel didn't seem to need any visible management as the staff were just fantastic and the place ran like clockwork. However, during a 10 night stay it would be nice if someone had checked-in with us to see how things were going or give us advice on where to visit in Lombok, explain mosque times, pools etc. That said... this didn't hinder us in anyway, it's just an 'in-hindsight' thought. If you're thinking of booking Qunci villas for a short break, long relaxing honeymoon or some luxury in your Indonesian travels I highly recommend. I'm pretty sure you won't regret it!"

","An eye-opening weekend getaway","Hi ScottMy boyfriend and I were your guests at Qunci Villas and wanted to share our experience:We stayed here for the weekend. When we first arrived our room wasn't ready so we were placed in a temporary villa for a few hours. Then when we moved, we were placed next to a villa that was undergoing construction and that made our first nights stay rather uncomfortable with many workers walking around and the noise. Thankfully on the second day we bumped into Scott's dad who helped us shift rooms to a more quiet villa nearby the pool area. So in total we moved rooms 3 times but the staff were kind and polite enough throughout our stay so that made the whole experience pleasant.The food is very good - it is fresh and gourmet style. Although sometimes the staff got our orders wrong (we got fries instead of salad / orange juice instead of orange+banana / black coffee instead of flat white), again they were all polite and friendly so that made up for it.At the pool deck / beach side, villagers would camp out and hawk their wares over the wall daily, calling to the guests to buy their goods. It was a practice that was both discomforting and strange for this to be happening right next to villa property -- this apparent display of the huge income disparity between the villagers and villa guests, only separated by a 1.5m ""Berlin"" wall. I felt sorry for the villagers' plight -- but also felt sorry for the guests who get continually harassed during the day to buy things when all they want to do is relax. Perhaps there is a way to have the villagers organize hawker stalls (with a bazaar theme) along the public beach side, so that people can walk along and buy trinkets on the beach, instead of soliciting guests who are still on villa grounds and disrupting their peace? Qunci and other resorts can also help promote this bazaar with flyers to hotel guests, and drive foot traffic to the hawkers. That way it's a win-win for both the villa management and the villagers."

The surrounding & the landscape was really impressive, the staff on duty was always putting up a smile face. The beach is very privacy, i didn't see any local hang around the beach area except some local sellers selling local hand made stuff. The breakfast was really awesome, the staff is very generous to allow us to order additional one set of breakfast. Last & not least, the WiFi has no interruption at all. My husband and I travel to Lombok for our yearly honeymoon. We will definitely come back to Qunci Villas.By the way, if I would like to book 1st floor room but not partial sea view room. May I know what is the room category should iI book? Can i book garden view & request 1st Floor?"

","Paradise on Earth","We stayed here with family and I must say it was one of my best relaxing holidays ever. The rooms and surroundings are designed on a natural theme and the staff are very welcoming. The pool area overlooking the sandy beach is what I have been dreaming of and far opposite one can see Bali. Food is of excellent quality with a wide selection of dishes, breakfast was varied, fresh tropical fruit juices and during the evening it was magical near the pool area which was all lit with candles. What I loved most is the open air shower in my room, so natural, showering under the open skies, if it rains you can shower with rain water too. One slight annoying fact is the early morning prayers by the nearby minaret, which wake you up at 5am. Not very nice if as routine I wake up early and in such a relaxing resort I am waken up so early again. Anyway looking at all the positive things this resort has they outnumber this one. If I visit Lombok again I will surely stay here and recommend it to my friends as well."

","Its not a hotel.. Its a Paradise..","This is the reason why you have to be patience for the best,because it took us more than 1 hour from Lombok airport to this hotel. But my,my.. It worth every minutes of your journey.You will be welcomed by a friendly faces, smile readily staff. A glass of a very cooling water. The check in process was very fast and they will take you to the room in no time.Everything was so beautiful,the pathway, view from our room.We booked 3 ocean view room with extra bed on 2 rooms, the extra bed was installed and ready when we arrived.Oh,the extra bed are really comfy,you wouldn't realized if its an extra bed.We quickly change into our short pants and enjoy the ocean,its a pity though, the seller at the beach were so many and get you confused with all of their stuff. But if your not planning to go out from the hotel,like me,you might find them usefull for buying souvenirs back home.Its valentine day,the day after, and due to workload, my husband cannot join us at Lombok. How surprised i am that after coming back from breakfast, there's a flower bouquet laying on the bed. Its from my husband. But what facinate me,my husband said he only need to pick the phone and give his credit card details and really the hotel arrange everything for him.At night, i had a chance to try their valentine dinner set and its so good.. Top notch for their chef.Like i said, their staff was magnificent. There are no staff who are not smile readily and give you a top notch service.What more i can ask from this hotel. A nice room with breathtaking view and awesome staff.Its a pity though, i only had 3 days there, but not to worry, i will certainly coming back to this hotel."

","Beautiful surroundings","We stayed here for 5 nights between Christmas & New Year. Overall we were pleased with the hotel & the service. The room was fairly basic for a 5 star hotel but the grounds & pool areas were lovely. We had a 1st floor room which was quite private but would not have been happy with the ground floor room for the same price as these were far less private & overlooked. The one thing which we didn't like about the rooms was that the bathroom was semi open air meaning it became quite warm & humid & was full of mosquitoes.We were really impressed with all of the restaurants. The food at a hotel is usually what lets it down for us but the restaurants here were of an excellent quality & at a reasonable price. There was also a wide selection of dishes so you wouldn't get bored eating here every night. The breakfasts were also tasty & inventive.Unfortunately I was very ill on our penultimate night which may have been due to something I ate/drank. My husband had to request very plain food for me from the restaurant which was a bit of a struggle. I would expect that in a 5 star hotel the understanding of the staff would be such that they could meet that need without too much difficulty.Taking everything into account however, the staff were very friendly & accommodating, living up to the 5 star rating. If we returned to Lombok we would consider staying here again & would recommend it to our friends & family."

","Did I come at a bad time?","I feel like I had a completely different experience from everyone else who reviewed this hotel. The grounds, the restaurant, and the location are great. The non-smoking pool inspired. The villas were comfortable although we had 2 very different ones where one felt much more luxurious than the other. But the real problem for us was the staff. Many were sour-faced, obnoxious, or incompetent. After a week of smiles and efficiency at other resorts on on Lombok and Gili islands this was a bit of a slap in the face. There was a holiday in Bali at this time - Nyepi - so maybe all the good staff was off..."

","Paradise in Lombok","We had an excellent one week stay at the Qunci Villas. Positives:- the room: we stayed in a partial ocean view room and enjoyed that it was more private than the ocean view rooms and garden view rooms. The space was lovely, plenty of places to read a book or have a meal. The air conditioning worked beautifully. We enjoyed breakfast on our balcony every morning at no extra charge! I adored the outdoor shower and bathroom area as well. - the food: although a bit on the pricey side (the 21% tax on everything was something we had to keep in mind) all the food was delicious. On our first night there they had set up a traditional Indonesian buffet where locals prepared a variety of fresh dishes - it was a real treat. Breakfast was included in the price of the room and we really enjoyed the plate of fresh fruit that accompanied our main dishes. - the atmosphere: Qunci Villas really is the place for anyone, there were families, couples, and large groups. There are three infinity pools/lounging areas: smoke free, adults only, and anything goes. We really appreciated having those options. The pools were kept very clean. The grounds were also incredibly beautiful. The beach was also very clean and the water was great for swimming. As others have mentioned the bottom is a bit rocky but it was no problem once you're out there. - Extras: the hotel offered a variety of organized day trips, themed dinner nights, and overall excellent service. I really felt like they went above and beyond. We also booked transfers to and from the airport which were a breeze. It was easy to find the driver when we landed. Negatives:- the day trips the hotel offered are a bit overpriced in my opinion. For example, if you're willing to walk 200m down the beach you can independently hire the same boats that the hotel hires for cheaper if you're headed to the Gili Islands. That being said if you're not too worried about money it is nice not to have to think about any organization. - the hotel had put two superfluous charges on our bill amounting to roughly $200 CDN. When we pointed them out they immediately took them off but if we hadn't checked... - on the second night of our stay there were a bunch of ants in one corner of our room, luckily away from the bed. When we notified the staff it was promptly taken care of. TLDR: amazing hotel with excellent service. Some minor negatives but overall a wonderful spot for a relaxing vacation."

The resort is clean and green while the staff there are polite and courteous. It is definitely a joy to stroll in and about the compound of the resort.As the resort is situated just in front of the beach, daily meals can be consumed with a spectacular view in front of you. If the sky is clear, you are able to see a mountain at the end of the horizon too! Our dinner is always accompanied by beautiful sunsets with the sound of the waves. Variety of items on the menu to suit your appetite (from international cuisines to local favourites) and they are priced very reasonably.The swimming pools (there are 3) are quiet and sun decks are plentiful for you to bask under the sun while they do serve snacks and drinks to you if you want.Definitely a great place to unwind and relax."

Restaurant across the road provided a great cheap alternative. I stayed in a Pool villa which was devine and could not be faulted, furinishings were beautiful.

","A stunning and quiet resort","Qunci Villas is one of the best resorts I've ever stayed at. The facilities are unparalleled with three infiniti pools, gorgeous villas, spacious floor plans, and sensibly decorated. We had a garden view unit on the second level but because of the proximity to the main road, we requested for a room change and they graciously accommodated us, which we are forever grateful. It was much quieter and the outdoor rain shower was a nice touch.Customer service is excellent and we feel welcomed wherever we went. The staff is courteous and always smiling. It was clear that they enjoyed working there very much. Food at the hotel is quite alright with prices that are comparable to restaurants in North America. Make sure you do not miss the happy hour and the themed dinner menus. Honestly, there's not a whole lot in Senggigi town; so if you are not the exploring type, there's plenty to do in the resort. The staff would be more than happy to organise an excursion for you as well.One thing that took the enjoyment out of my visit was the beach side vendors that would stand right by the pool, trying to sell their items to tourists. It would have been a beautiful view by the pool and the restaurant if not because of them. I understand their need to make a living but it was distracting nonetheless.Overall, beautiful resort, excellent service, affordable spa, quiet but average beach, amazing experience. Will come back again!"

","very stylished, trendy hotel direct on the beachfront in Mangsit - Lombok","the hotel is very nice located on the beachfront in Mangsit, despite that it is not a real good place to swim in the sea, but for this there are two big pools, the waves were rather high this time, so we prefered to use the pools....service was good, the breakfast as well, only dinner was rather disappointing, but itÂ´s a main problem at many hotels, they canÂ´t cook as they do in local restaurants, cause they always try to offer fusion food and not original indonesian cooking, which would be much more tasty...the spa is very well done there, was rather irritating that even it is published to leave mobile devices out of the spa, the american owner of the hotel used his mobile during his foot massage session, which was rather annoying and not very respectful against other guests....the rooms in the back, close to the lobby are in a very dark area, not good view, the concept location of the bungalows is not very well done, as the rooms in the back are really not cozy....direct on beachfront there are not many options, as this is used for the pools and the restaurants...."

","Heaven on earth","There are things in life, which are just hard to describe...A stay in Qunci Villas, Lombok definitly is one of this things. It was so perfect that I hardly can find words for it. Like described in the hundreds of other reviews before, the property itself is just stunning. So what more can I say that has not already been said...? The great attention to detail is everywhere ubiquitous. The architecture and artworks throughout the hotel are just beautiful. The garden with the many tropical plans is well cultured. Compliment at this point to the gardeners, who are doing an amazing job and even cutting the lawn by hand (!!!). Everything is incredibly green, although temperatures during summer can rise quite high. Really well done!The rooms are spacious and equiped with thoroughly selected furnitures of high quality. The bed is really big and super comfortable. An absolutely highlight for me was the open bathroom, which allows you to take a shower under the spangled sky. Another highlight are the three infinity pools overlooking the sea, which are offering an incredible view (on clear day you will be even able to see Mount Agung on Bali). The view is especially marvellous during sun-set time (don't miss the 2 for 1 Happy Hour...). The two restaurants offer a wide range of delicious meals of high quality for reasonable prices. My favourite is the lunch menu with a big variety of salads, sandwiches (try the Feta cheese Foccacia) and much more. As dessert you have to try the ""Molton chocolate cake"", which is my personal favourite dessert... The drinks are also absolutely worth to mention. All juices are prepared freshly and my favourites are the orange juice, banana with lime and the sugarcane juice. Furthermore you should not miss the BBQ night on Wednesday evening, which offers a variety of fresh Fish, seafood, chicken and beef along with salads and much more. Also you should definitly check out the Spa (my favourite is the Balinese massage)... after your visit you will feel like newly born...But Qunci offers more beside this ""hardfacts"". The thing about which guests in the 21st century are caring especially, is the service. Guests want made to feel special or to say it literally they want to feel like a king or queen for the time of their stay. Facts like rooms, properties, destinations are convertible, but the service and the way, which the staff is make the guest feeling, of a property, are truely unique. Guests care for being treated nicely and made feel special. That's why the truely USP of the hotel is it's staff with his sincere friendliness, attentiveness, professionality and especially love and passion for the job which they are doing. Please take a good care of them as they are the greatest asset! As I am also working in the hospitality industry, I can definitely say that in a business such as ours, which is characterised by a strong competition, small things are making a big difference and in Qunci you will find many of this small things,... Starting from the lovely welcome drink, served upon Check In, together with a cold towel for refreshing and ending with the complimentary Ice Water served on the swimming pool. This are just examples of a wide range of nice, small gestures, which you will find in Qunci everywhere and which are a great example for the uniqueness of this hotel.Lombok itself is just an absolutely dream destination. Crystal clear water, many nice beaches, waterfalls, rainforests, friendly locals, nice food... It has all what a holiday destination needs to have and allows to combine the possibility to relax with the possibility to explore... You should rent a motorbike and drive along the curvy streets to the north, which are offering some spectacular coast-views. There are also some nice beaches, like Pantai Pandanan, Nipah or Malimbu. From there you also have a nice view to the three Gilis, which you also definitely should visit. Highlights in the south are the beaches Tanjung Aan, Selong Belanak and Mawun Beach in Kuta, as well as Pink Beach, which is although a bit difficult to reach (long drive and bumpy streets). If you have time - Gili Nanggu is also definitly worth a visit...Senggigi, the touristy center of the island, is only a few minutes by car from the hotel away and offers some supermarkets and nice restaurants for lunch or dinner. Thanks to the fabulous team of Qunci Villas for making my stay unforgettable and one of the bests I ever had in a hotel around the world. I will be back for sure.In the end I just can say: Everybody, who has ever been in Indonesia (and especially Lombok) not only with his eyes, but with his soul, for whom it will remain a ""desire- destination"" forever..."

","Another Great review !","What more can I say that has not already been said ! It's a great place !A few things to note however: it is a few km to town if you want some shopping or restos etc. Too far to walk but a taxi is only about $ 2 each way. The beach in front is OK but not great. Swimming is OK in the ocean but not great and same for beach walks. Other parts of Lombok are better if this is important. We had 5 days and loved it. Ate all our meals there, excellent food, and great half price happy hour cocktails.Sunsets are amazing.Spa was excellent too.We arranged a day tour with them to the waterfalls which was very enjoyable, good guide, and reasonable cost. Also used their airport transfer which was very good and reasonable too.We had a partial ocean view room which was fine for us with a nice balcony with modest view to sea. If that is important I suggest the real ocean view rooms."

","Luxury, Romantic & Relaxing ","I have stayed to Qunci Villas Hotel two nights @ Deluxe room with Partial ocean view. It was amazing & very comfortable. The staff was to helpful & friendly. They gives your before you ask them. Fas response & nice house keeping. The resort view directly to ocean and there are hawkers. They sells traditional handmade goods. And there're some boats to take you to 3 Gili island if you want Or take tour around sea. I recommend to stay in hotel only One day for relaxing. The breakfast was amazing and they serve it on room."

","A dream holiday","We have been here for 2 weeks, it was absolutely amazing! The resort is relaxing, you are surrounded by a lot of green. Itâs good rating is well deserved. Staff is extremely helpful, resolve any requests with a shocking speed, food is of excellent quality. A lot of fish in the sea to explore (swim more than 200m away from the beach to see them). Just 5 minutes away is an amazing jungle with waterfalls and black monkeys. No tourists there at all! (Just turn left on the way to Senggigi into the Wisata Alam Street.) Generally, you can either relax in the resort (get massages in the hotel spa or from local lady called Hadzia for 120 by the beach) or if you feel like rent a scooter from the reception and explore the coast. We also went to visit several beautiful places around the island (1 day trips with a van or boat) - e.g. Gili Islands with loads of fish and turtles in the sea, 5 waterfalls in the jungle south of Rinjani volcano, the beaches of the south-east where we tried surfing for the first time. There is a local guide Dani who we have to recommend - he is a very nice chap, not pushy unlike some other sellers on the beach or in Senggigi. He and his friend Wir (who teaches local kids in the school right opposite the resort) have shown us the places around the island. It feels good to support the people who live in the local village of Mangsit rather than guides from elsewhere. Daniâs number is +62 819 07121437. Our holiday at Qunci Villas was one of the best that we have ever experienced. Highly recommended!"

","Stunning resort, disappointing service","We spent 5 days at Qunci villas and looked so forward to staying in this beautiful resort. It truly is a stunning hotel with magnificent views and the best part is the infinity pool right on the beach. However we experienced some servicing issues with the resort. First morning we ordered breakfast for our room and we never received it at the specified time, upon contacting the frontdesk to ask whats happening to our breakfast they said no order was given, but and order was definitely collected. Breakfast was then organised and served. But later that day at around 3 when we got to our room from the pool the room wasn't even serviced. Breakfast dishes was still there and bed hasn't even been made up. Contacted the front desk to notify them about this and said they will send someone. After waiting 45min no one arrived yet, so we went to front desk to inquire about this and spoke to the manager, she then apologised and sent the cleaners to our room, but she never came to checkup if the complaint was resolved or not, i would think that if you as a manager receive a complaint like that you'd follow it up and make sure that all has been resolved. After this we had 2 days of great service again until we had another servicing issue where tea cups that was used the previous night was not cleared and cleaned and whoever cleaned our room just turned them over, needless to say it was full of ants when we wanted to use them again. This is such a beautiful hotel but they seriously need to look into their room service staff and make sure that they follow up to see if everything is done to their standards as the rest of the resort is really well maintained."

","Paradise and Value for money","This hotel by far has to be the most beautiful setting, overlooking 2 infinity pools and a beach. The rooms are beautiful, ample space in a double room as well as the use of the balcony. The spa facilities are excellent and they have promotions so do speak to them before booking a massage. Every meal we ate was fantastic and good range for vegetarians. We did a few excursions to the neighbouring islands, just booked it when we got here no need to prior book. We booked using an online site."

","Beautifull villas on the beach","we stayed here for 6 days and enjoyed every moment. We had a villa with beach view. From our bed or terras we looked over the sea. The restaurants are perfect. There are so many places to have breakfast or dinner. You do not have to sit in the restaurant itself, but you can also have a romantic table a view meters from the sea. The staff will do everything to make you comforteble. So excellent service. You feel special from the first moment. The complex is not too big, just perfect for a great stay. The architect from Holland did a great job, when he disigned this place. Also the maintenance of Qunci Villas is top. We love this place, that is also very nice for honeymooners. If you want entertainment, it is a few minutes to Senggigi. For example in the late evening at Happy Cafe with a good life band."

","Fabulous experience","We recently stayed for 4 nights in a beachfront villa (Rm56) at Qunci. The environment is well planned and creates class and relaxation in a magnificent location, where it's hard to find a reason to leave the villa. There are 3 restaurants, 3 infinity pools, great spa menu, and poolside services. Beautiful architecture and artworks throughout the hotel and immaculate gardens, provide a beautiful place to stay. Outdoor (attached) bathroom is quirky and large. The website reflects what you get. It's easy to see why weddings are popular in this beautiful location. Staff were always great to deal with. We used Hotel transfers to airport $30US/car, which currently takes 90mins, but new hwy which opens shortly will reduce time to 50mins. A great stay in a great place. Keep this hotel for special pampering holidays. Local cabs cheap."

","Best bit of our holiday in Indonesia","We spent an incredible 4 nights at the Qunci villas. We had a villa with a private pool which was exquisite. Everything was splendid - the design of the resort, it's location by a beautiful beach front, excellent service at every level and terrific food. The Thai and Asian inspired dishes were great and the kitchen made it a point to keep things interesting by organising themed dinners from time to time. Perfect if you just want to laze around and enjoy the resort without having to worry about leaving to get a good meal. The only small blip on the radar were the one too many hawkers who were allowed to stand by the pool front and badger guests to buy their goods. This took away from the privacy of the resort and was a bit of a nuisance at times. Perhaps they could be given a designated area by the sides to sell/display their wares so guests could go to them rather than it being the other way round. However even these vendors and tour guides were perfectly nice people out to make a living for themselves, so it's something we could overlook. All in all, we can't wait to be back at the Qunci Villas!"

","A great place to escape and recharge.","After staying down in southern Lombok, I was hoping for a great hotel, as Sengiggi didn't appeal to me. Staff: Check in was tranquil, organised and prompt. Wait staff and pool staff are friendly, quiet and efficient most of the time. There can be a bit of a wait for coffee or drinks at breakfast - not that it bothered us. Promptly ran around resort, cleaning up debris, after a storm. Loved when some would stop and chat with us for a longer period.Location: A couple of local beach restaurants, and a restaurant across the road. One small shop, and not much else. The black sand beach can be walked, but it is a workout in the soft sand (which I enjoyed after all the food). The skinny beach wasn't stunning, especially since we had come from southern Lombok. People were trying to surf out in the break, but it was tiny and messy. Room: We opted for a seaview villa. Beautifully simple decoration, love the artwork. Toilet was older, and it took a bit to work out taps on shower. Bathroom door was noisy to shut. We lounged on front deck most of the time, which was only about 10 steps from the pool, and overlooked the sea to Bali.Spa: Very well priced compared to Aussie pricing. About $150 for a four hour package. Loved the herbal teas. Tranquil rooms and relaxing stone flower bath in private courtyard. Good massage and the scent of fruit in the facial was devine. I didn't find the chairs for the pedi and mani comfy, and ended up with a sore back at the end of the day. The lunch was the icing on the cake - delicious!Food: Even though on the more expensive side - I can't fault it. Yum!!! Everything from the vego burger to the healthy lunch included in my spa treatment was senstationally delicious. Happy hour cocktails were great too - 2 for 1."

","Heaven on earth!","I recently celebrated my 40th birthday at Qunci and honestly if I had to turn 40, I couldn't think of anywhere I would have rather been!Myself, my husband, our two year old son and my parents stayed in Qunang, the luxury two bedroomed pool villa up the hill behind the resort. It was absolutely beautiful, spacious, comfortable and well worth the money.The whole resort exudes understated classy luxury. Not an Aussie bogan or Bintang singlet in sight! The grounds are maintained beautifully, everything is modern and in perfect condition and very tasteful.We spent our days enjoying a well catered breakfast in our villa, a morning around our pool, afternoons around the hotel pool(s) with happy hour as the sun set.We ate regularly at the hotel and meals were an absolute bargain and beautifully presented and absolutely yummy! The menu offers plenty of variety and our toddler enjoyed it as much as we did. We had a few meals offsite in Sengiggi and they too were well priced and tasty.I loved, loved, loved that they had a non-smoking pool and deck area. With smoking not so popular in Australia, we just hate travelling overseas and having inconsiderate smokes polluting our air and harming our child, so the non-smoking pool area was so brilliant for us! And for all the smelly smokers (sorry, disgusting habit!), there are two other pools you can go and be anti-social at, Qunci Villas really has thought of everything.The beach out front is nice enough, clean, black volcanic sand. The hawkers out the front of the hotel are really lovely and as happy to have a chat and play with our son as they are selling. No hard pressure like in Bali. The massage ladies are awesome too and my parents had daily massages with them.My mum and I visted the Qunci Spa and it was very special. Be warned though that the hot wrap, is SO HOT! I felt like I was being roasted and was on fire, it was rather unpleasant but avoid that and I am sure it would have all been amazing. We hired a boat to the Gili Islands from Pak Jum ""The Dolphin Boat"" just to the right of the hotel one day. Pak Jum was seriously the happiest tour guide EVER!! He snorkelled along side us and seemed to enjoy the day as much as we did. It cost $700K for 2 for the day, worth every cent.The staff are friendly and professional and doted on our son. We had a small problem with one of our butlers, but we won't go into it here as everything else was just so perfect. Thank you to Ony & Eko for taking such good care of us.Simply Qunci Villas is heaven and earth and worth every bit of the 14 hours it took us to get there. We couldn't recommend it highly enough and will be definitely be back. Thank you for such an amazing experience!"

","Exceptional.......","From the moment we were picked up at the airport by your driver Eka to the moment we checked out I was in awe ........... I felt so lucky to have found this piece of paradise. We were greeted with a smile, cool water and refresher towels by your driver who was full of information for us to absorb. On arrival we were shown to our Ocean View 1st floor room (recommend if you can afford) which outshone our expectations, especially loved the outdoor shower and sound of the ocean waves crashing at night. The privacy of our room allowed for us to sleep with the doors open, feeling the sea breeze. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff, any request we had was attended to with a smile and grace. We were there for 6 nights, I took 3 books and 2 magazines which were never opened. For me the view was simply enough......What more can I say other than thank you so much for meeting more than my expectations, the photos don't do this place justice...."

","Qusia Villa; Unforgettable Family Holiday","My family & I (7 adults & 4 children) spent 4 days in beautiful Qusia Villa, a part of the Qunci Villas Hotel complex in Lombok. What a wonderful stay it was, really unforgettable as we all totally enjoy the sojourn here. With 3 big bedrooms, an open air living space near a big pool plus a small children pool, a lounge, a TV room, a reasonably equipped gym, one will certainly have a fantastic stay here plus the privacy of the Villa itself. The rates are pretty reasonable. On top of that, we have the services of two butlers the whole day, taking care of our breakfasts & also orders from the restaurants. We had one particular butler, Pak Arie, who is really efficient, friendly & helpful in many ways. However, the only disappointment that the family has is the distance of Qusia Villa from the seaside. But a car is always available to take us to the main hotel complex, about 3 minutes away. Perhaps I would like to suggest that the management pays more attention, perhaps a face-lift, to the furniture especially in the bathroom. Looks old & the toilet in the bathroom is open, difficult if we have children. If the opportunity arises, we will certainly have another family holiday here."

","Simply Love It !","After researching several hotels in Lombok in the context of a short holiday, we finally decided to stay two nights at this hotel. The journey from the airport to the hotel took about one and a half hour. The checkin process was also quick and smooth. We got a garden view room which is located behind the reception area.The view was nice but unfortunately the air conditioner in the room was not working properly. There was dripping water wetting the coach underneath.We were immediately moved to another room that was located closer to the pool, but in this room the air conditioning was not cold enough. We had to call back the officer to fix this air conditioner. We also enjoyed lunch at quali restaurant and breakfast at Quah restaurant. This two restaurants located side by side. Maybe next time we will also try NooQ lounge bar which serves a Thai set menu nightly.Overall Qunci villas is the best choice to stay in Lombok. Probably you do not need to be anywhere during in Lombok because Qunci Villas is a holiday destination itself."

The day was everything we expected plus more, no detail was missed from start of ceremony to the end of the reception. The Ceremony was held in the grounds of the main resort in between the 2 infinity pools over looking the ocean, the amazing team at Qunci set up the ceremony to look like something out of a fairy tale. After the ceremony was completed our guest enjoyed beautiful cocktail hour with canapÃ©'s by the ocean (the cocktails are by far some of the best we had all had) our guest were then transported to 3 bedroom luxury villa Qusia up on the hill by the Qunci team. On arrival into the Villa the guest enjoyed a 3 piece band with more cocktails and a Thai banquet. The comment all our guest made was that this was by far the best wedding food they have ever experienced :) :) So a big thank you to the wonderful team at Qunci Villa if I could do it all again I wouldn't change a thing :) 10/10 and also the Wonderful GM of the resort Wiwit was amazing nothing was a problem"

It's so good here that you don't really want to leave the hotel. A large % of Lombok locals are Muslim so you do hear the praying quite loudly over the speakers at 5am but you get used to it."

","A very nice place but can improve a bit","Overall a very nice 5 days stay, as requested we got the sea view room # 23 , which is the best sea view room of the hotel, even if early morning you can heard a little bit the mosque prays. The driver at the airport was waiting for us, and during the 1 hour drive gives a good introduction to Lombok and the hotel. The hotel is in perfect harmony with the nature and with the modern art and woods art displays, even if in some case (lighting bathroom/ no blackout curtains) the rooms are not functional. There is plenty of place around the 3 pools , however once at 12:00 at the bar/adult pool , I was told no pool towels were available by staff , I had to go myself to fine some towels around the nonsmoking pool. The beach is ok, but not as nice as the ones in Gili islands. The breakfast is quite good with fresh juices , with a la carte menu, even if once they put our plate on an empty tables , and after looking for it for 10-15 mins , re-served them after a short stay in in the microwaves , this is non acceptable. The Mediterranean restaurant have some very good surprises like the French duck cassoulet , Basucade de moules (Camague) and from Toscana the cacciocco a la nivornese (toscane), however the BBQ and Paella nights were quite a disaster due to poor services and some âpasse-droitâ to some the waiters serving private/reception tables. This was the poorest BBQ ever in Asia, a pity as some of the foods (shrimps/sausage) were delicious, but the buffet was limited and the meat not very tender . As mentioned by other guests, the staff tries very hard to make your stay perfect, however no changing bath towels, forgetting toiletries ,happened a few times, no coffee bags only one bag of tea and Chamomile (why?) , nothing serious and it is corrected within minutes. SAFETY (Red Card) : we booked a day trip to Gili via the hotel , and based on weather forecast I asked before confirming the trip to the staff and boat coxswain ,if based on their experience the return will be safe in the afternoon. Well , the trip went well until 14:00 (and I recommend it) , however during the return that took 1 Â½ hour instead of the 45 minutes , it was in a sea state of 6-7 (Beaufort) with waves up to 4-5 meters. Another boat from the resort was with us (WE were the only boat at sea) , and lucky enougn, we and the other couple were used to sail , but this will have being a very different story with children , old persons or non-swimmer. I talked to the staff in the regards to their duty in regards to safety, but they donât seem to be really concerned , however I was pleased to see that the boat trips were cancelled for the next two days as the weather was not improving. Overall this is a very good hotel, for adults, as not too much to do for kids except the pool /beach. I will easily return, however Gili islands are really beautiful and there are plenty of options for beautiful Cristal clear beaches , snorkeling spots , eating , hotels that I regret to have go there in the first place."

","Beautiful resort","We stay here for a week in a villa with private pool at room Qayla Excellent: The man who picked us up from the airport was so-well-mannered and know what the hospitality is. He was so helpful and made us feel welcomed. The checked in process was quick and they brought us immediately to our villa once we've done with the payments. The villa was good. It has a crystal water in the private pool- really clean. We walked around to the pool side, and we couldn't believe our eyes. Such a very nice resort ! It has 3 main pools which has the same depth. 1 pool is smoking free.Not so good :Yes i am indonesian...but nothing to do about the race, as long as people stay in your resort or eating in your restaurant, they are your guest. You can not separate the service between a service for western peoples and for local peoples, we all pay the same price. Im not complaint though, i better give an advice so the management well-noted it that the male staff totally needs to smile. Like what i wrote for the NooQ, the female staffs should teach the male staff how to smile and how to give a service.But at the end it was a really nice stay...."

When we came to leave we got a late check out and they gave us a lovely room to change in. Food is expensive by Indonesian standards but cheap compared to places such as HK or Singapore. The adult pool was empty most of the time and so we felt like we had our own private pool. Nook was a great place to eat at lunch and we tried the set Thai menu there one night. We were the only people there! We ended up with our own private waiter and chef...and it didn't feel weird. A great place that i would highly recommend."

","One of our favorite vacation spots in Asia","We have lived in Asia for the last two years and travelled pretty extensively. We just spent the long Chinese New Year weekend at Qunci Villas in Lombok and it was clearly one of the best vacation spots we've ever experienced in Asia ... maybe in the world. We chose Qunci based on some friends' recommendations, but were a little nervous as all of our friends had come to Qunci for romantic couples' weekends. We were traveling with a group of 7, including 3 kids (9, 7, 6), to celebrate my wife's 40th birthday. The highlights:1. Warm welcome at a point when we were exhausted from airline delays2. 2 bedroom pool villa - perfect for a family3. Staff organized a surprise dinner at one of the beachfront gazebo's for my wife's birthday - decorated with white sheer curtains and flower petals. Very special dinner.4. Amazing massage - maybe the best ever?5. 2 for 1 happy hour6. Fresh lime juice for breakfast and happy hour for the kids7. Ocean front infinity pools8. Poolside food service and candlelight dinner by the pool9. Open air showers to gaze at the stars10. Hotel helped us get home when we were trapped in a storm at Gigi T!No complaints, but the air con in some of the rooms was kind of weak as was the wifi. But both helped us be closer to nature!Can't wait to come back. Thanks Qunci for such a special weekend!"

","Beautiful & Relaxing Lombok","Had such a great stay and highly recommend.Pros-Perfect layout. Multiple infinity pools across the property.-Food. Was surprisingly tasty and well-priced. Breakfast (worth the included price of the stay) was delicious and made to order. Nice poolside snacks and rotating dinner schedules.-Spa. Reasonably priced and good services.-Staff. Nice and attentive service.-Rooms. Loved not having a TV and beautiful bathrooms. Powerful A/C was welcome as the sun is really strong in Indonesia. Wi-fi throughout the resort isn't strong/great, but why is that an issue!?Cons-Not really/little beach area in front of hotel. I think down south there are big beaches you can walk along. You can walk along the hotel on the beach, but it's more of a black sand beach.-Beach hawkers were pretty ruthless and aggressive as you sit by the pool. Wish the management could get them to move to the side or not bother guestsOverall, we stayed during off-season so it was very affordable but we would recommend Lombok over Bali any day. Explored the Gili islands north of the resort easily through a private boat the hotel booked, but want to come back and see more of this great island! Keep in mind the long drive from the airport when booking."

","Lovely vacation","We had a great vacation at Qunci villas. Spacious rooms, nice porch to enjoy at night. Very good and varied breakfast offerings. Fusion cuisine up to par. Barbecue and Indonesian buffet were superb.On the minus side: You wonder who designed the bathroom lighting, it is completely useless if you want to shave or put make up on since the lights are right in your face, must be a designer's dream ...As noted food is great but it takes forever to get it. Staff is nice and overly polite but somewhat inefficient. May be they need training for example on clearing the table.All and all a great vacation."

","Excellent hotel, service, views...the lot!","This hotel is spot on. It's relatively isolated, very serene and has amazing views of the sunset. The service is really good, while the staff are very friendly and attentive. I've seen a few reviews saying this place is like a 5* but at a fraction of the cost. That pretty much sums it up.The restaurants are mainly fusion, so you may want to head into Sengiggi if you want something that feels like it's more off a street stall. You can book your day trips through the hotel. We did and it worked fine. You can also negotiate with the guys on the beach, but I found no major price difference. The guys on the beach get their cash quicker if you pay them directly.The hotel pools are next to the beach and the local guys will try to get you to buy stuff off them. Didn't bother me one bit, as I enjoyed talking to them, but you could tell other guests were getting annoyed. To be honest, I see that as their problem and not that of the guy trying to make a living.It's a 90 minutes drive from the airport but that's supposed to come down once a new road has been completed (I was told March 2015). For me, Lombok and this hotel made the best place I've been to visit in Asia in the last 2 years. "

","Tropical Paradise","This is our second visit to Lombok and we decided to stay at Qunci after a friends recommendation. We were not disappointed, what a beautiful picturesque resort! We stayed in a one bedroom pool villa which was very nice. Incredibly spacious with a large private pool and lounging area. The beachfront area where we had breakfasts and dinners offers stunning views of the ocean and especially the sunsets, where tables overlooking the ocean can be booked. The staff are excellent and we would particularly like to single out Husni. This guy really made our dinners, he was friendly, funny and very attentive. Thanks Husni!!Qunci also makes an extra effort putting on events during the week, which not all resorts in Lombok do. The BBQ night was excellent.There was unfortunately an issue with the Wifi in our room, which did not work at all. We made multiple calls to reception who reset our codes, but nothing worked. They suggested we sit outside our villa where the signal may be stronger, but we don't want to be sitting outside late at night while trying to do work. The Wifi near the common areas was perfect, so it was simply not enough signal in the villas. This really needs to be addressed, and is the sole reason why we have rated Qunci 4-star instead of 5-star.Despite this one issue during our stay, we would definitely return to Qunci and would recommended the resort to anyone visiting Lombok."

","Luxurious but affordable","An affordable luxurious hotel with three infinity pools and direct access to a beautiful beachfront. I recommend opting for the breakfast inclusive package because it comes with coffee, juice, fruit platter and a wide selection of main courses from the menu.Food at this hotel is expensive. For two people, you may have to fork out between IDR 280,000 and IDR 350,000 (without alcohol). However, food quality is very good. Felt the restaurants used fresh ingredients i.e. âhonest cookingâ. I rarely taste good food at hotels and thumbs up to Quincy Villa for offering this valuable experience. Very disappointed the resort offered Happy Hour (Buy 1 Get 1 Free) for alcoholic drinks only. The free wireless network is unstable and very slow even during the off-peak season. The signal strength varies depending on where you are in the resort."

","Can I go back yet?","Everything about Qunci Villas was fantastic. From the initial inquiry to final checkout, I loved every moment. We never had to leave the compound - my personal goal one day was to walk to the other end just to see it... multiple amazing restaurants, fantastic spa, infinity pool right on the ocean and an outdoor shower in our incredible room, why would I ever leave?The F&B staff were fantastic and never left us wanting.I truly cannot wait to get back to Lombok and Qunci Villas."

","What a place","I am not the type of traveler to ever set foot in a resort I'm paying for, but when coming to Lombok for a week with my girlfriend, I thought we should do it right. Qunci Villas is doing it right. The place is designed with heaps of amazing art and features. There are small rock pools everywhere; lush gardens and trees make it feel like paradise.The villas are huge, a lot of room for activities. We stayed in a garden view room, which seemed a bit more private than the pool view villas. The bathroom was amazing. It's outdoors, but walled off so there are no issues there. A bit of fresh air to your bollocks is a nice touch. It has a large stone bath which is lovely to rest in after a long day of resting. Just make sure to put the do not disturb sign up, or your resting may be disturbed by the turn down service that sprays the rooms for mosquitoes. The bed is quite big, and could probably fit four people comfortably, which is good if your significant other lashes about during the night.Food that the resort offers is wonderful. There are two proper restaurants and one bar type place. All the names have q's in them, like everything else in the resort, which was on cue. Meal prices were quite reasonable for what they were. Service is nice, the staff are attentive and professional and enjoy when you try to speak Indonesian to them. The staff overall are good, everyone says hello and smiles.It is located just 5 minutes from Sengigi, which is really just a strip of road with some touristy shops and accommodation. It takes about 40 minutes to get to the harbour for boats to the Gili islands.I would come back to Qunci again, it is an amazing experience."

","Relaxing break in a lovely setting","Myself and my husband booked the one bed pool villa for a week. Normally whilst on holiday, we have a couple of days relaxing by the pool and spend the rest sightseeing. This holiday we never left the resort! The villa was really lovely, kept immaculately clean. Bed is huge and super comfy, the outdoor bathroom spacious and the shower powerful. The private pool was much bigger than we expected - however we spent much of our time at the main 'non smoking' pool which overlooks the ocean, it was nice and breezy and the view is just incredible. We used both restaurants for lunch and dinner, food was very good. We attended the BBQ night which was really impressive and there was also a 'chicken taliwang' event (I think this is a once a year event hosted by different venues) which was really fun. The staff were very helpful, friendly and professional at all times. (The only negatives, and certainly not enough to knock off any stars...the main pool at times looked a bit cloudy and the aircon in the room could be noisy. Wifi was sketchy which we asked about and there were problems with the router. We could live without it as we were on holiday after all. The villa closest to the non-smoking pool was being renovated which was a bit noisy one day - we retreated to our own villa. There are also two other pools which we could have moved to but we loved the non-smoking aspect!).We had a wonderful time and can't wait to return. Thanks Qunci!"

","You will forget all your troubles","Wow, what a magical resort. I am not one for sitting by the pool at a resort on a holiday, but I easily did it at Qunci Villas. The resort is just beautiful. Frangipani trees in bloom are everywhere which makes it so easy to make you feel like you are really are in paradise. There are three restaurants which serve different types of food. All excellent quality cuisine with staff to match the service. They also have different cuisine theme nights. Breakfast sitting outdoors right by the ocean is a must. All of this means you never get bored with the food. The spa has plenty on offer including early morning yoga and I actually feel asleep during a massage which is always a good sign. I stayed in Qayla, one of the pool villas. It was amazing. The pool was the perfect size, with an outdoor area with your own pool lounges and an undercover area if you wanted to escape the sun with a comfortable lounge for lying about and reading. The outdoor shower was nothing I had ever seen or experienced. Having a shower looking up at the beautiful blue sky was something I will never forget (but very private at the same time). Nothing was too troublesome for the staff. They were exceptionally friendly and always eager to help. They also had an amazing ability to remember your name and greet you by it whenever they saw you which was a very nice, personal touch. As I said, not a person to generally do the resort thing, but would easily do it again at Qunci."

","A wonderful place to stay","My boyfriend and I stayed at the wonderful Qunci villas for 5 nights in February. The hotel itself is located right on the beach in beautiful Mangsit, Lombok. It is a short drive to Senggigi, which has lots of great restaurants. We stayed in a beachfront villa, which had a lovely view of the beach. The room was tidy and beautifully decorated with modern pieces of art. We ate at both the Quali and Quah restaurants. The food, whilst not cheap, was delicious and worth the money. The staff were very attentive and friendly, and made every effort to ensure the dining experience was one to remember. Quinci is a well designed resort, the constantly changing artwork throughout the resort adds a unique charm. A definite must day in Lombok!"

","Excellent place for a relaxing getaway","We are based in Jakarta and came for a three-night stay over the weekend. First of all, we had an excellent time, I would recommend Qunci Villas to anyone and would love to stay there again.The reservation process by E-mail was speedy and pleasant. We chose to arrange the airport transfer through Trac, at a rate that was a little lower than the one quoted by the hotel (Trac: IDR 340,000 one way, hotel: USD 32, about IDR 400,000). The next time, however, I would just use a taxi which should be even cheaper. Bluebird and Express taxis are easy to find both at the airport and in the street in front of the hotel. Another alternative, especially for groups of more than four persons, would be to use the DAMRI bus from the airport to Senggigi for only IDR 35,000 (less than USD 3) and to take a taxi from there to the hotel.The welcome was very warm and the check-in process was perfect. I got a feeling that the hotel's management is very rigorous both in the selection and the training of its staff. There seem to be very detailed scripts and procedures in place which the staff follows religiously, while remaining friendly and warm at all times. We were handed a cold face towel as well as a cold glass of juice upon arrival and asked to sit down for the check-in. The staff spoke excellent English. The process did not take long and we were soon escorted to our room.I had chosen a room with an ocean view. Although it was slightly pricier than a garden or partial ocean view room, I feel that it was money well spent. We got room No. 22, which is on the very left of the property, with a lovely view, just a few steps both from the beach and one of the three infinity pools. The staff showed us around the room, explained everything and then left us to enjoy the place.The room is entered through a porch that is equipped with a comfortable, bed-sized bench with a mattress and pillows, an armchair and a table, on which a plate of fresh tropical fruits was placed. The view is wonderful; if it is windy or you would like to be shielded from view, you can close the bamboo blinds.From the porch, you immediately enter the bedroom through a wide, sliding glass door. A minor criticism: it was at times a bit difficult to lock and unlock the door from the outside, and it does not close tightly - there is still around a centimeter of space which lets air through. From an energy conservation viewpoint, this is wasteful.The centre of the bedroom is the very comfortable double bed which has one mattress and one blanket. On the left side of the room is a bed-sized comfortable bench similar to the one on the porch. Along the head end of the bed, a long, narrow desk is placed. The bedside lamp has a dimmer which makes it possible to get the amount of light just right - I'd love to get the same lamp for my home, unfortunately I couldn't tell the brand name. The room is decorated with tasteful works of art with an Indonesian flavour throughout.A corridor leading to the bathroom houses the wardrobe with a safe, the mini bar and a kettle to make coffee and tea. Excellent quality TWG tea bags are provided free of charge.The spacious bathroom is a true highlight. It is decorated with a beautiful sculpture and the rain shower's ceiling is open to the elements (but protected from view through angled wooden boards). At night, you can see the moon peek through. Two minor criticisms: I cannot fathom why the bathroom door can be locked only from the outside, not the inside, and the towel rack - while very beautiful - is not practical, because the towels are not spaced widely enough to dry well.There is no TV in the room, and I was glad for that. There is, however, a TV antenna outlet, so I suspect that you could probably ask for a TV to be set up if you really want one.The food and beverage facilities are beautiful and the food is good. The breakfast is not a buffet, but a la carte. A plate of fresh fruit and a glass of juice are included with all the menu options. My girlfriend asked for milk instead of juice. Although this was not an option on the menu, the waiter just asked if she preferred cold or warm milk, and it was provided without an additional charge. The food tasted good and was beautifully plated. We tried both restaurants and were satisfied.The laundry service is reasonably priced and fast, and I would recommend to bring less clothes and use the laundry service in order to avoid having to check in luggage.On our second evening, a special barbecue dinner took place, with a chef from Australia, David Pynt, who runs a restaurant in Singapore called Burnt Ends. We were seated at a table together with a very nice couple who live and work in Lombok. The dinner was quite pricey (just under USD 100 per person, including wine), but it was certainly an experience.On the third evening, a cookoff took place which pitted local restaurants against each other, each trying to cook the best Ayam Taliwangi, a local delicacy. This event was a lot cheaper, but unfortunately there were some organisational deficiencies. The food was supposed to be served from 7:30 p. m., but it took almost until 8:15 p. m. The buffet table was too small and awkwardly set up, so it could only be accessed from one side, creating a needlessly long queue of hungry guests. The signs with the names of the foods were only in Indonesian, and while the always polite and friendly staff was on hand to explain, this created more delays. Also, the signs had been set up hastily and some of them were in the wrong places.The total cost of three nights of stay, including the events as well as food and beverage (we only had one meal outside the hotel), was about IDR 10 million. We were very satisfied with our stay at Qunci Villas and hope that we can soon stay there again."

","An amazing place!","We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Qunci Villas, so pleased we made the decision to stay there. The hotel itself is set out really well and maintained to a high standard. The 3 pools have amazing views over the beach and ocean towards Bali and there were always sunbeds available with clean towels with the lovely touch of a fresh frangipani flower! The staff were very friendly and always willing to help with any enquiry, nothing was too much trouble. We had an upstairs partial ocean view room which was perfect for us, I think they probably had a bit more privacy than the ground floor rooms. Loved the outdoor bathroom and open air shower which was a bit of a novelty! We would definitely go back again, just a shame the direct flights from Perth are no longer running, but we won't let that put us off! Thanks to everyone at Qunci for a wonderful holiday."

","Paradise!","Qunci is absolute paradise. We arrived after a rather hectic week in Bali and it was a perfect escape. I can confidently say this is the best place I have stayed, every aspect was beyond expectations. If you are looking for a hotel to relax and unwind this is definitely the place to do so. We stayed for 5 nights and were rather reluctant to leave. We think we might have to make it an annual event!"

","Secluded beach-front location, room disappointing","After staying in Ubud and Seminyak we arrived in Lombok for the last leg of our whistlestop Bali tour, staying at the Qunci Villas. We both had high hopes following many of these great reviews. The best reason to visit this hotel is the warm, friendly and engaging staff, on hand to help with anything. The location of the hotel is also stunning, and beach front pools and sunbed areas a delight. I loved that you could have breakfast, lunch or dinner at the beach tables starring directly out to sea. Our only regret is that we felt this hotel wasn't great value for money. It was more expensive than the others, and less luxurious. Although the huge private pool in our villa was wonderful, as was the outdoor shower, the room itself didn't live up to expectations, and I almost felt some of the interiors were on the verge of looking tired. Some of the paintwork was beginning to peel around the skirting boards and some of the towels could probably do with being replaced, and mini bar very average. The bed wasn't as comfortable as we'd had hoped, and the room was a bit dingy. The room lacked a certain sparkle needed to do justice to the lovely location. We also battled with the pronunciation of the name of our villa! Numbers might be easier... For the price we paid, I don't think we'd return."

","My favourite pace to while away the day","I tend to shy away from choosing favourites: so much depends on your circumstances and your mood. This is particularly true with hotels, but for Qunci Villas I will make an exception. Having travelled the world for both business and pleasure for over forty years I have stayed in everything from hovels in rural Tibet to five star hotels, but Qunci Villas is my favourite place to stay. It just seems to get it all right. The beautiful blend of minimalist architecture, art and artefacts; the attention to detail (cutting the grass with hand shears) and the efficient but understated service combine to make it the ideal environment to relax. Breakfast of fresh fruit and coffee served on your own balcony looking out over the garden or the sea sets you up for the day. Admittedly there is not much to do here, but I came to relax, so days spent reading on the balcony or swimming in the pool looking out over the sea to the Gunung Agung volcano in Bali, rounded off by fabulous imaginative seafood in the Qulai restaurant is a great way to pass a few daysThis is my second visit in ten years, and although the place has grown substantially in that time it has not lost any of its style or charm. It won't be my last visit."

","Magical honeymoon","My wife and I went to Qunci for our honeymoon a few days back from the date of my writing this, and it was an experience we shall cherish for quite some time.We first decided on this hotel after reading the reviews of various hotels from right here in this app, and were thankful that we did.When we first arrived, we were greeted warmly by the ensemble of staffs headed by Putri, who sufficiently assisted us on the intended adjustments for our pre-booked romantic dinner, and spa packages. Both we would highly recommend for any newlywed couples on honeymoon.The first day of our arrival were just spent resting, due to all the fatigue of wedding ceremonies the night before, flight time and the 1 hour taxi ride from the airport. Dinner on the first night was seafood at one of the restaurants inside the hotel. Prices were fairly reasonable, and one of the restaurant staff in particular named Luhur was very efficient throughout the night. Impressive service.Second day was R&R for us, the spa and massage was magnificent, as expected of any Indonesian traditional massage, and the price was also reasonable. My wife especially enjoyed swimming in the hotel's infinity pool by the beach afterwards. There were traveling hawkers passing by the pool, but they respect our privacy when we politely declined their sales, and will never enter the hotel premises.The romantic dinner was awesome! My wife utterly enjoyed the sunset and especially the signature ""molten cake"" the dessert ending the 3-course meal.Ramli, the staff catering for us throughout the dinner was very efficient too.3rd day was water activities in the Gilis for us. If you haven't already know, you MUST visit the gilis if you're ever in Lombok.Dinner was already planned for us, as on the 2nd day we received an invitation letter in our room to a barbeque dinner for the 3rd night, so that saved us the hassle for planning. Off to Gili!We took a boat directly from the hotel through a hawker selling a tour service. Quite a high price for a round trip to Gili Trawangan, Gili meno, and Gili Air. We didn't mind paying cause it saved us the hassle of finding a snorkeling set and they can even show us all the nice spots.The barbeque dinner in the evening was momentarily disrupted by sudden rainfall, but the restaurant staffs were very fast and reactive that they managed to relocate the barbeque and guests, and proceed with the service with only slight delay. Props to the team.All in all, it was a superb experience, and one I feel proud to recommend to anyone asking for my opinion. Keep it up guys!"

","Excellent !","We were met by one of the staff at Lombok airport, he was very nice and kind and passionate person who loved his job, the car was very nice and modern we had a refreshing towel and bottle of water on arrival for us which was great to cool down, driver also went out of his way to stop and help me purchase a sim card from a local shop. The resort is 10/10 very well maintained and the nicest resort in the senggigi area, we walked around the other resorts for a peek and found Qunci to be the best one and that we had made the right decision. All off the staff at Qunci are extremely friendly and go above and beyond to make sure your stay is pleasant. Rooms were excellent we had the sea view villa, the spa was fantastic for a massage. The only thing i missed was not having a television in the rooms to watch a movie before going to sleep. Dinner was amazing, cocktails were made to perfection, We have recommended to friends and family and cannot wait to stay again."

","Details make perfection in this restful paradise","Qunci Villas exemplifies how attention to detail, friendly service and tasteful design make the difference in lifting standards of hospitality to a new level. Everything is so thoughtfully carried out and set out, so that you feel that your needs are well taken care of and you can truly have a stress-free vacation - even with three children in tow. Apart from those qualities, I would come back here because the spa, the food and drinks are all relatively affordable, so that you don't feel ripped off because you are a 'captive audience'. In fact, it adds to the homely and restful atmosphere of the place and we didn't feel like we had to 'stint' on items like soft drinks in the mini bar or at our meals because of prohibitive prices. in the end, we probably ordered more drinks than we would do so at hotels normally, therefore enjoying our meals all the more for it. Other pluses - Rooms are clean, housekeeping services are timely. Hotel itself has a great layout with artistic and wonderful design details. Amazing view of the ocean from the poolside. Clear seas and clean beach - with no sandflies - fronting the hotel. There's some nice wave action for body surfing and/or beginner surfing (there's a stall next to the hotel renting the boards with a friendly guy who helps set you up but do so at your own risk). Stronger swimmers may even enjoy some convenient snorkelling (despite the waves), although the Gilis are worth a trip. If we had to make a couple of suggestions, they would be as follows:1) While we understand that many of the guests are couples, perhaps during 'family vacation season', there could be a couple of tables set aside for families in the breakfast area by the beach (maybe with some portable chairs) and/or use the gazebos for those who would like to experience that option. 2) Suggest a couple of additional 'soup' or 'pasta/pizza' options in the children's menu, for variety.Also, a word of caution for light sleepers (though we understand this is beyond the hotel's control and part of the general cultural experience): The early morning (430am) prayers at a mosque nearby are carried via a loudspeaker which can be heard from some of the garden villa rooms and you may like to choose a different room if that's not your preferred choice. Finally, we would like to compliment the team working in the hotel - every staff we met was attentive and friendly. Most of all, we felt that our children could have fun in a safe and clean environment. Thank you, Qunci Villas, for taking care of us."

","Unique beautiful hotel","We left Qunci Villas yesterday, having spent five days at this very special place. From the moment we arrived nothing was too much trouble for the friendly , delightful and efficient staff. Everywhere you look there are beautiful and interesting artworks, flowers and well looked after trees and gardens. Loved the great sized infinity pools, so many comfortable sunbeds with loads of cushions and towels and plenty of shade if wanted. We upgraded after first night to part sea view just upstairs from our allocated room as found a bit disconcerting hearing everything from adjoining outside bathroom , and people being able to see inside our room when curtains open.This cost extra 20 dollars a night . Outdoor bathroom in this one bit smelly at times. Breakfast either overlooking beach or in restaurant good. We chose to eat out after first two nights, but barbeque and Thai meal in resort ok, bit pricey though. So glad we had chill out time at Qunci Villas after our busy month travelling around Indonesia. Would highly recommend this excellent hotel."

","Worth every penny!","Wow! We stayed here for 5 nights and the more hours you spend here the more you see how beautiful this place is. Obviously love and dedication has been put in designing this place and choosing all the different artworks to place in and around it. Okay so normally we only have diner once in our hotel and then explorer restaurants in the neighbourhood. This was a first: havent left Quincy for diner elsewhere.... Both restaurants serve superb meals. The ala carte breakfast everyday was a true treat.The infinity pools were great and the wifi works fine everywhere. Some people may miss a tv in the rooms but it actually felt pretty nice not having one. Makes you read some books and sleep early.Another great thing is that you can feel that the staff has had proper training in hospitality. They were great and made our stay.If back on Lombok will stay again.Things i'll remember:+ The Huevos Rancheros for breakfast! Wowww try it!+ all the vietnamese lunch items on the menu+ The bloody mary's made with fresh tomatos+ The nice lighting by candles and a fire every evening- The six o clock wake up service by the local Iman. The first morning i jumped up: so loud it was like he was standing in our room! But hey it is the island of a 1000 mosques...To Scott: had a lot of fun reading all your reactions on TA. As a frequent user i must say that i always read the terrible and poor ones first including the reactions of the management, keep up the good work. Only one tip of advice: have a smell in room 18 if think the airco need a thorough cleaning, it smells a bit moldy."

","Average place","This hotel wasn't at all what I expected. They had three pools which where OK but I am a short person like 5ft. No shallow end all pools where 160 and the pool had a very rought surface. I ruined my bathing suite but I guess that was my fault cause I was lening over the edge and my bath suite always was getting caught on the rought service. They always served frozen butter for meals but they did put mine in the microwave so I could actually spread. For the price I would not stay that this Hotel again."

","Highly recommend Qunci Villas","My husband, son and I have just returned home after a glorious 9 night stay in a one bedroom room with pool at Qunci Villas. We had an amazing time and thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of our stay. Our room with private pool was spacious and comfortable. We decided to choose a room with a private pool as our son is 2yrs 9 months and is still having day sleeps for 2-3 hours. We didn't want to break his routine but also didn't want one of us stuck in the room every day while he slept. With the pool we could continue to laze on a deck chair and both enjoy leisure time while our son slept. It worked perfectly. A special mention must also be made for the staff. They were incredibly friendly and willing to accommodate our son, even when he was being a typical toddler and was a bit naughty. Most of the food and beverage staff knew our son's name by the time we left and it made us feel very welcome. They would go out of their way to socialise with our son and would engage him in conversation and limited play. We were very impressed with the professionalism of every staff member we had interaction with from the lobby staff, to the spa, those poolside and the landscape gardeners. We also loved the general feel and ambience of Qunci. The art that is scattered around the property really helps to create an atmosphere that is quite different to any other resort we have stayed at. Qunci felt sophisticated but also relaxed. We loved our time there and definitely want to return."

The villa is spacious and the staff as attentive or as hidden as you want them to be. Lovely view and a trip down to the main hotel is available all hours of the day and only takes a few minutes. We were meant to go to the one bed villa due to another booking but the staff kindly upgraded us to the 3 bed villa at the 2 bed villa price and all I can say is wow!!! It is massive, indoor and al fresco dining area, 25m infinity pool all to ourself. A fantastic hotel in lombok if you want to spoil yourself. The finishes to the hotel are superb, the cocktails at happy hour decent and good, the breakfasts are amazing, and the other food we had was all good... I find it hard to find faults in this hotel."

","Wonderful luxurious retreat","Great location, lovely and peaceful. The gardens are beautifully designed. Privacy in villa with pool. Stayed 5 nights for a winding down holiday - never left hotel it was so comfortable. Food was good and the restaurants were varied enough for short stay. We did venture out to beach restaurant round the corner for one meal which was fine but nothing special. Staff were very attentive and always smiling - great service. Would go back."

","Outstanding location and resort !","We spent 4 wonderful days and nights at Qunci after a week in Seminyak and it was like arriving in heaven. Peace washes over you the minute you are led from Reception to the pool area to await your room, and soak up the superb location. Everything is so beautifully spread out, that you never feel crowded by other guests whilst the various aspects and views consume you. I expected the rooms to be first class, and they were, but the outdoor bathroom is gorgeous and such a special experience. The staff are outstanding. Attentive, cheerful but not instrusive. The 3 different restaurants work well and depending on where you sit you feel like you have been to different locations. Breakfast can be served in your room but why? when you can gaze into the roling surf under a palm tree on the waterfront. The spa was out of this world. Private facilities in each room that were beautifully decorated with orginial painting. My therapist Diana was professional and I didnt want to leave! Thoughtful touches (I I have NEVER experienced in chain resort likes Sheraton etc.) like staff delivering complimentaty glasses of chilled ice water (with a slice of lime) to EVERY guest that was poolside, a random times and daily at 4.30pm offering a complimentary fruit kebab to each guest that was poolside. A lovely intro to happy hour that commenced at 5pm ! Undoubtedly the best resort of have stayed in for a very very long time. I would go back in a heartbeat."

","Best Holiday and Best Hotel ever!!!","The people:What can I say, it`s the best hotel we`ve ever been before. The service people are really friendly, very courteous, they speak german very well. And they are in a good mood.The food:The food was great as well. We tried all three restaurants. The sea-food, the thai and the mediteran restaurant. The prices of food, are cheaper than in germany. We paid approximately 20 euro for two dinner.In the afternoon, there was a happy hour from 17.00 to 19.00.The wheater and the landscape:The temperature was in september at an average of 30 degrees. October is the beginning of the raining season, told us a local. But for an european it is warm enough with about 25 degrees.On the beach you must have a look because there are a little bit tides (ebb and flow). In the morning you could go surfing.Activities:We made a few trips. One to the gilli`s, where we could go snorkling with our guide Sam. He was looking for an turtle especially for me.Another trip was to the buddism and hinduism temple in mataram and in senggigi.And the last trip was to the waterfalls close to senaru. I think it was the Sendang Gile Waterfall."

","The only place to stay in Lombok","The location of this property is fantastic with a stunning outlook across the Bali sea. The property is beautifully designed and appointed. The beach is a bit rocky under foot and during the time we were there the surf was quite rough so swimming in the sea is an option but mainly for strong swimmers and or surfers, but you don't really need to as the pools(3) are beautiful?There is not a lot around outside the resort other than some local restaurants so we spent most of our time at the resort and only venturing to a local place for dinner. Although we did travel to the islands (Gili T) for a day which was very good - definitely a party island for the young.Service at this hotel is outstanding and the recruitment and training is a real credit to the managers. Thee was absolutely Nothing we asked for that was not delivered with a smile.The breakfast is al la carte and very good selection of western and local. For dinner you have a choice of local , thai and Mediterranean. The local cuisine is very good. We had a ocean view room facing the pool on ground floor which was great. Would recommend that you always take an ocean view room as the partial and garden view rooms are not as good ( you get what you pay for). We were travelling with friends who did have rooms in garden and complained about being woken early (4-30am) by the call to prayer from the local mosque. No such problems in out room though.We also did the Indonesian cooking school for 2 hours and then we were served what we had prepared. Highly recommend.This resort is very quiet and beautiful and we all loved our stay at Qunci Villas. The staff here make this a fantastic place to stay."

","Paradise on Earth!","After a strenuous hike and a stressful ordeal back in Lombok, the seaside resort of Qunci Villas was the perfect place to rest up. The food was fantastic. The rooms were fantastic. The service was great. The price, very good. It was a trip and a stay that I will always remember."

","Very well designed","We stayed here for 5 nights over New Year as our final part of a 3 week holiday and really liked it. Its very quiet, peaceful and relaxing and although we had planned to do some sightseeing, we never left as we were too comfortable to move! The hotel is well designed and not too large with beautiful gardens and running water and pools everywhere and interesting artwork.Accommodation - we had a two-bedroom pool villa, Qima, which was well positioned a few steps back from the beach and close to the restaurants. The villa was very comfortable, basically two rooms, each with their en-suite and dressing area with sliding doors out to the central pool area which was furnished with 2 day beds and tables and a couch. The pool was long enough for laps with waterfalls at one end. Each room had a kingside bed, very comfortable with good linens and the only goose feather pillows we had during our 3 weeks, heaven! Nice lighting and artwork. Excellent air-con. We slept really well. Our bathroom was huge and one wall was fitted with open hanging space, room for cases underneath and underneath that drawers and a bottom shelf for shoes, shelves at the side housing the safe, tea/coffee facilities and a full size fridge stocked with soft drinks, bintangs, etc and copious amounts of free water. A door leads through to an outdoor rainfall shower which was lovely. The toiletries provided were good quality, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, soap, body lotion, cotton buds, shaver set, and toothbrush/paste set. Good towels, cotton bathrobes and flip flops. The rooms are turned-down each evening and sprayed for mosquitoes. The resort also sprays the grounds twice per week and you are warned in advance. Still got bit though! There is free wifi everywhere with a good signal.Facilities - there are 3 infinity pools straddling the beach, one non-smoking and one adult only which means everyone is well catered for and if you want to be away from smoking or children you can be. Loads of loungers with cushions and umbrellas and a few thatched day beds. There are hawkers on the beach but they don't pester and are separated by the infinity pools. Good pool service with iced water brought to you and fruit skewers, etc. You can order drinks and food from the comfort of your lounger, have it served there and all you need do is eat it! The pools are a perfect temperature and must be cooled as everywhere else we stayed, the pools were too warm. They are all long enough for laps. There is always something to watch from your lounger, the sunsets which were stunning with Mount Agung on Bali peeping through the clouds, the surfers, fishermen in the water, local boats.Spa - check the booklet in your room when you arrive as there are special offers listed. I took advantage of the jet lag package, 1 1/2 hours of massage, body scrub, etc and it was excellent and half price. Nice, calming environment. The therapists also visit the pool areas offering a free taster session and without pressure to buy.Restaurants - 3, Nooq by the adult pool which serves a set Thai menu in the evenings which is very good value. We didn't manage to get a booking here as it was always fully booked. This is also a nice spot to take advantage of the 2 for 1 cocktails/spirits between 5 and 7pm whilst watching the sunset. Then Quah and Quali which are housed in the same building, both have outside seating on the deck in front of the sea wall with firepits burning. The resort looks beautiful in the evenings all lit up. We ate at both of these and they also have theme nights, we did the BBQ night which frankly could be improved. When we went to get our food, some of the dishes were empty and it lacked smooth organisation. Breakfast is also served here and again you can eat by the sea if you choose or in your villa. Breakfast is a-la-carte which we find preferable to a free-for-all buffet. Fresh juices, loved the banana, and a vast choice of dishes including eggs benedict, french toast, childrens breakfast and they were very good in adapting to what you wanted, ie just plain poached eggs with toast rather than what is on the menu. Both restaurants are non-smoking unless you sit outside. We had a room service dinner one evening, there isn't a menu as such, you ring and they bring the restaurant menus and you can order anything you like. The lunch menu is the same across each restaurant and there is a vast choice, particularly enjoyed the fish and chips. In busy periods, if you want a specific table, make sure you book in advance.New Year celebrations - there was a set special menu or you could just eat normally. Party horns were delivered to our villa in the afternoon. All the ponds were lit with candles and there was fireworks on the beach at midnight which were very good and went on for ages. It was good to see the local families run down the beach to watch them with the guests.Service - excellent by everyone we came into contact with, particularly the young ladies at Nooq who looked after us everyday. This hotel is spotlessly clean and very well cared for.Improvements - it is a shame there isn't a bar where you could just sit and have a drink in the evening. All the restaurants tables are set up for dining and there is only a very small seating area and bar stools in Nooq.I would highly recommend Qunci and have no hesitation in staying again should we find ourselves back in Lombok. It is rare to find somewhere that caters for couples and families and pulls it off so well."

","Great place for two","Really was one of the best vacations we had, all was perfect, food surroundings and service. Dinner at bonfire, overlooking the ocean, listening to the music from the waves.Only minus would be, it is located outside a town, so if you want party, call for a cab."

The pools and sunbathing decks overlook the ocean, the restaurants are open air with beautiful flower arrangements and everything is simply lovely!The property is not huge and impersonal but very intimate, not too small so that everyone feels cramped but really well designed.The food in the restaurants was also of very high quality, especially the chicken green thai curry-that was absolutely delicious."

","Relaxing holiday!","It was a 5 nights stay with family from 1st Jan 2015. Qunci is a cozy place , well maintained , excellent service, good food and not much of resort activity to distract you. It is just you and mother nature .Did a couple of day trips organised by the resort team and it was very well arranged.If there is one thing to crib about ,it is the lack of a gym facility. Not clear why the management sees it as a 'holiday unnecessity ' ! However for runners , one can choose to run outside the resort on the road which is safe and provides you the opportunity to do some hill running! Over all , a lovely holiday experience."

","The staff try hard to impress...","We stayed with Qunci Villa with another family on Christmas Day for 5 nights and had a lovely time.I was a little disappointed with the ocean view upon check-in as it was blocked by a big tree but apart of them, the room was well cleaned and cosy.Our room came with breakfast inclusive and we weren't too impressed with the food quality and taste. On the second morning , I discovered that our croissants in the Big Daddy Croisanwich were not cooked on the inside. I peeled open all of them and realized that the outside of the croissants were puffed but the dough inside was raw. Some of the staff didn't looked very enthusiastic in serving but it didn't bother us too much. We had lunch and dinner at the Asian restaurant and the Pasar Malam theme night was disappointing too. The variety was limited and we felt that it wasn't good value for money at all. Food at Qunci for us was 2.5/5. We had a very nice meal at the next door villa (Sudamala) and the food was of better quality and taste, presentation as well.I had two massages and a pedicure at the spa and I would give the therapists a 3/5. The pedicurist didn't do a good job with the heel scrub and one of them even injured my friend's cuticles by cutting into her skin. No apologies was offered.On the second day, I discovered a few tiny black 'caterpillar looking' bugs on the bed and floor. Thankfully I picked them up before lying straight onto my bed! This went on for the next couple of days and I finally alerted the housekeeping. Finally, I told the front desk about it who took the initiative to inform the guest relations officer. He called and asked if they could move me to another room for a thorough clean and check but I rejected as it would be rather inconvenient to pack and unpack with two remaining nights left. They however graciously did a 3 hour cleaning. I handed them the 'bugs' in the plastic bag and was glad that the manager, Wiwit actually followed up with our complaint when I met her at the front desk. She was helpful and was quick to do a service recovery in suggesting a small compensation for the unfortunate encounter with the bugs.I have to commend the staff for doing their best to impress the guests, though some of the service staff in the restaurant needed to show more enthusiasm. I was impressed with Wiwit's sincere effort and intiative as many hotel would just claimed that 'they will ensure that we have a better experience in the future', but no action would be seriously taken. For her, she ensured that service recovery was carried out right away.On the overall, we were impressed with the resort's cleanliness, artistic design and influence, and the smiley faces of this who played their part to keep the villas beautiful. Housekeeping was prompt when a request was placed and they were helpful. On a personal note, the floor tiles at the outdoor shower was a bad choice as the floor could get very slippery when it was wet, especially if it rained. It puzzled me that outdoor tiles weren't chosen for the right use.I did few batches of laundry and they were usually returned by late afternoon except for the last day, my laundry was not returned until 11pm when I called them. I was due to check out the next day early morning so I settled my bill after dinner. On the check out day, I was stopped by the front desk who informed me that I had an outstanding laundry bill. I wasn't pleased with this last minute incident as they could have informed me the night before or in the morning before I checked out, not when the taxi was waiting and I was rushing for a flight. What frustrated me was that there was a mistake in the bill. But since it was only a very small amount, I just paid and left hurriedly.In conclusion, Qunci villas is beautiful and the staff is generally nice but improvement is needed with regards to restaurant quality and service staff."

","Lovely Christmas and New Year Break","My husband and I spent ten nights at Qunci Resort in Senggigi over the Christmas/New Year period. The rooms are beautiful, pools are amazing, food is delicious and ALL staff offer amazing customer service - everyone is just so lovely. It is a beautiful place. I would highly recommend eating at Molly's Bar and Grill which is located directly across the road. We had quite a few dinners here during our stay because of the delicious, well-priced food. Service was quick and delivered with a very welcoming smile. We rate the BBQ Ribs and pizzas - all were very nice!!!"

","Pure Bliss","My husband and I stayed for 2 nights at Qunci Villas as a recovery after our Mt Rinjani trek. It was amazing!! We were given an upgrade from a standard 1 bedroom pool villa to the premium Qasmaran pool villa, which was absolutely beautiful!!! In fact, the only thing negative that I can say about our whole stay (which only my husband noticed) was the slight gaps in the wall surrounding the villa that could allow people to look into our pool area if they were desperate. While there, we ate from both the restaurants and had drinks at the bar. The service and food were excellent and we also loved the room service breakfasts that we had delivered daily. Great variety, delicious and fresh!The whole place is impeccably maintained with beautiful gardens and has a selection of pools to choose from. Although it's expensive, I believe it's worth the splurge!!"

","Truly an idyllic location","My husband and I had an opportunity to have a holiday together for 6 nights without our two boys, so we chose Qunci Villas for a relaxing and romantic break away.Unfortunately, after booking, Jetstar ceased its direct flights from Perth to Lombok, and it was unfortunate that we had two flights with a lengthy stopover, so it took us 15 hours to get from door to door.The transfer organised by Qunci Villas was very smooth, and the car drive from Lombok Airport to the Villas was about 1.5 hours. We were very glad to get to our room - we had a quick bite to eat and then fell exhausted into bed. The rooms have a very large triangle shaped window above the sliding doors to the apex of the roof, and this window did not have any blinds. I then went to find the light switch to try and turn off the lights on the outside deck, as it was 9:30pm and having been up since 3:30am, I was desperately needing to get some sleep and couldn't do so with the lights streaming in. I couldn't find any light switches to turn off the lights, so I rang reception only to be told that there are no light switches and that the lights automatically turn off at 11pm. I advised them that I really wanted to get some sleep now, and they just reiterated that the lights would be automatically turned off at 11pm, and if this didn't happen, to ring them again and they will get the engineer out to turn them off. My husband can generally sleep anywhere, anytime, so this did not worry him, however I am the complete opposite and having grown up on a farm in the middle of nowhere, where it is pitch black at night, I realise that I am a lot more sensitive to light and noise than most. I then tossed and turned until just after 11pm when the lights on our deck area were switched off.Unfortunately this was not the only night that I had to ring about these lights. The third night we were there, the lights were still on at midnight, so I placed another call to reception, asking them to turn the lights off. Their automatic response was ""they are automatically turned off at 11pm"", however this clearly was not the case, as it was after midnight, and quite clearly they were not off. This also happened again on our last night, where at 11:20pm, I rang and got exactly the same response about them automatically turning off at 11pm. I again had to advise them that it was, in fact, well after 11pm and that the lights were still on, before they agreed to send someone out to turn the lights off.On a similar note, if you wake up when the sun hits your room, you will wake up quite early due to the top windows not having blinds. The other option is to have a ground level room, however I found that the majority of these rooms were not very private as they pretty much all had paths right next to them, and in order to have privacy, you would need to have your blinds all closed, which would defeat the purpose of being in absolutely picture perfect surroundings. So it's a case of pros and cons with this issue.On the positive side, the resort was absolutely picture perfect. The grounds were absolutely stunning - the gardeners do an absolutely fantastic job of keep the gardens maintained to the level that they are.The three pools were also fantastic - long enough to do laps in. Even though the resort was fully booked (Xmas - New Year period), there were always sun lounges available for you to relax on. The staff were always on hand if you needed another towel, or needed a drink or something to eat. Nothing was too much trouble. One of the three pools was a non-smoking pool and deck, which is great, as being from Australia we are used to all public areas being non-smoking, so when you travel to other parts of the world, the smell of smoke can really affect us negatively. Having said this though, when the hawkers in front of the pool light up, the non-smoking pool area is not so much any more.The staff at the resort were very nice, helpful and courteous. Most would nod at you or say hello when you were walking past. The staff at NooQ Bar remembered our room number as we went there several times. There were no issues with not being understood.We ate at all three of the restaurants - the small Thai restaurant at NooQ Bar - a different set menu each night; the Japanese/seafood restaurant, which often had a different theme, whether it be the BBQ night (which was fantastic), the paella night, or local music and dancing; and the Mediterranean restaurant. All three served very good quality food, if a little on the pricey side by the time you add the ++ of 21%. The fact that the Aussie dollar has fallen quite a lot recently didn't help! We didn't have a bad dish at any of the restaurants. We thoroughly enjoyed eating at the Qunci restaurants.A pleasant surprise was that wherever you were within the resort, you could ask for iced water and be served a refreshing glass of cold water FREE of charge. This is a great policy, as it encourages you to keep hydrated and in most parts of Asia, whether you are in a hotel or a restaurant, you usually have to pay for the water you drink.Breakfast was a set menu a la carte system, which was served in the restaurants or on the deck in front of your room, which we did most mornings. The breakfast itself was generally pretty good. A small gripe was that I would cross off eggs when ordering room service breakfast, as I'm allergic, but every morning, I would receive eggs all over my breakfast and have to scrape them off. I would also ask for beef bacon instead, but never received any on the three mornings I asked for it.Apart from a snorkeling trip to the Gili islands, organised through the resort, we did not leave Qunci for our entire stay. The snorkelling trip was US$85 for 2, and while we could have done it cheaper, by either taking a taxi to Bengsal Harbour and taking a ferry, or haggling with the boat owners next to the resort, it was still good value for money. Note though, that they will probably take you to a restaurant for lunch that I'm sure they get kick-backs from. Insist on a different restaurant if you're not happy. We did just that and had an extremely good meal at Caballito de Mar.We also enjoyed several spa treatments. We were treated very well, felt very welcome and enjoyed the cool lemongrass drink before each treatment and warm ginger tea after. Prices were higher than that at independent spa establishments in Lombok and Bali, however I thought that they were less expensive that those that would be charged from most good hotels. For example, 1 hour reflexology was US$20++, which was approx AUD$31, and a 1 hour back massage was US$30++, which was approx AUD$46.The staff, the grounds and the location of the resort were all top-notch, the room, however was just a fairly average room - admittedly we have travelled extensively and usually stay in highly rated accommodation according to TripAdvisor reviews. The room was clean and tidy, but lacked the ""WOW"" factor. There was only a very small amount of space for hanging clothes or putting them in drawers - the hanging space wasn't long enough for dresses. Half of our clothes stayed in the suitcases.Also, there was no TV in the room, something I hadn't picked up on before arrival. This was a disappointment, as we had planned to spend some lazy afternoons and evenings catching up on some movies and TV series that we wanted to watch. Having already requested a microwave and been told that they were not part of the room equipment in the resort, I didn't then think to ask for a TV. Given that the resort was 100% full, and that there were many families with young children, I'm pretty sure that one would not have been available, but it is something that I will now know for the future.We were also slightly disappointed that there was no formal room service. You could go to the restaurant and request something be sent to the room, however there were no menus in the rooms, nor a direct phone line to the restaurants.Also, as some others have suggested, the Call to Prayer from the nearby mosque at 4-5am can be a little annoying. It didn't affect my husband, but I woke every morning because of it. It is just part of life in a muslim country, and I had expected it, but I do think that having a thatched roof does little to muffle any noises that are around. Downstairs rooms would be better if this is an issue.In conclusion, I wouldn't hesitate to come back, but I will know better which part of the resort, and which room I would like to choose, and I also know now from reading further reviews today that I could pre-book a TV in the room. If Jetstar re-commence direct flights from Perth to Lombok in the future, I am sure that we will be back.Thanks for a relaxing break."

","Luxurious resort in Senggigi.","We were made to wait for the airport pickup for abt 20mins. After a direct call to hotel, the driver finally came and apologised for being late. Heru is a very nice chap tho. it ia abt 1.5hrs journey from airport to the hotel. Pls be wary for those with kids. The hotel will enforce the hotel 'per head policy' even if u do not require an extra bed for ur kid. We had a bad encounter with their front counter staff Ms Febri which apparantly jus wants you to pay for our 9yrold daughter stay. She didnt even apologised for the late airport pick up. Rude straight face service. Service was finally taken over by a very nice chap, Nova who made our stay nice. We are frequent travellers n had no issue with other hotels. Qunci shud be flexible enuff to allow kids to stay at no charge if no extra bed required n only charge if kid require breakfast (like other hotels). After numerous complaints, eventually the manager (tks to nova) decided to waive our daughter stay n breakfast.Hotel itself is very nice. Agreed with all the posts. Well kept, trimmed grasses, nice partial seaview room. Really enjoyed the swim in the pools. Breakfast is yummy. It is ala carte type but you can order again (or other meals) at no extra charge. Nice one there. Dinner is nice but our orders came salty like other reviews. I thk the chef shud taste it before sending them to the tables.Overall nice resort with room for improvement for service n dinner meals."

","5* service levels","What stands out for me is Qunci's service levels. Just take a look around, there will be a service staff ready to attend to any request yet I never once felt that the staff were intrusive or overbearing with their presence. Not an easy feat with the number of service staff that Qunci has. Extremely accommodating with staff who all generally spoke decent English. As other reviewers have noted, the outdoor bath becomes quite redundant when it rains. Once, we sat in our swimsuits smelling of chlorine while waiting for the rain to stop so we could shower. Though, I imagine that if we had asked, Qunci would probably have directed us to an indoor shower facility somewhere in the resort. One small tip, would suggest not booking the Gilis boat trip with the resort. Could just as easily walk down the beach to the right and negotiate a much friendlier rate with the vendors there. From what I could tell, Qunci uses the same third party vendors. We were handed over to a 'captain' who did not even come on the boat with us. The two young chaps steering the boat spoke very little English and seem to be in a bit of a hurry to get back to Qunci so they gave us time limits, though the resort had told us beforehand that we could tell the (missing) 'captain' how long we wanted to spend at each Gili and they will wait for us. Also, though some might disagree with me, I much preferred the food at Sudamala. Though pricier, every meal I had there was slurpworthy, from the carb dishes to the meats, seafood and desserts. Qunci, to me, was not too good with the meats - chicken was too dry, beef was too tough."

The only reason I rate if a 4 and not 5 is because of s few reasons: the proximity to the loud mosque, the lackluster beach (you can swim there but it's not great- bring water shoes as there's a lot of dead broken coral in the water.. Luckily the infinity pools are fantastic) and a small service mishap. I had called the restaurant staff from the room to ask them to order in soymilk to enjoy as part of our breakfast, as most of my family cannot drink cow's milk for a few different reasons. The last time we stayed here they got some for us without a hitch. They said it was too late to get any in for the next day but that they would have some the following day. In the end they either did not order it or there was some miscommunication among the staff and they could not find it. We bought our own from the grocery store in the end. In the same vein of things, I must commend Qunci for having a separate vegetarian menu to order from. However, this could be enhanced by simply clearly marking which items are vegan on the menu, and by writing on ththe regular menus that there is a vegetarian menu available, as this was not clear to us the first day or so, and naturally not all staff members understood the concept. Keeping soymilk in stock and on the menu would be lovely too. One more tip: if staying in lombok make sure to make at least a day trip out to the Gilis! They're only a 15-25min boat ride away from the nearby Bangsal Harbour area."

","Absolutely incredible, must visit","Qunci Villas is a must visit. Everything about the hotel was spectacular... Room, comfort, ambiance, food, staff, service, location, everything....Located close enough to the gili islands for a day trip, but also tucked away, the hotel was perfectly designed. I was shocked to find out that it was built in 2003, the hotel has been so well maintained that i would not have giving it more than 5 years.Great for all types of visitors: honeymooners, families with younger children, family with older children, and older couples looking to relax. Qunci caters to all.This hotel would easily be double the price if it were located in bali or somewhere more developed/touristy, but since Lombok is still up and coming, prices are very reasonable.Must visit, you will not be disappointed...."

","Ticks All The Boxes","Our family of 5 enjoyed 5 great days at this resort; from the three year old, two teenagers, and two adults in need of some chill time this place ticked all the boxes! Friendly staff, great rooms, two pools, and an ever changing seascape, complete with traditional pole fishermen, and lanteen fishing boats. Would recommend this place to the family oriented, or honeymooning couples!!Although the rainy season, there was enough rain free time to get out and about. The choice of eating venues served our needs well, and the lack of television a Godsend!"

","Excellent hotel","This hotel offers everything you could want from a 5* place. The service from all staff was on another level, whenever having breakfast Ajir would always have a chat with us about the island or football. Every breakfast we had was excellent.The hotel itself is only a $1.50 taxi ride away from the centre of senggigi.Some people have said about the hawkers at the beach side of the pools but I actually found that useful as I could organise my boat trip to the Gilli's whilst in the pool.This is the standard that all hotels should be aiming for."

","Out little piece of Heaven on earth","So was this our 7th or 8th trip to Qunci... We have lost count! There honestly isn't one thing we could criticize about this wonderful place... It's a five star resort with a 7 star service!! This really is our home away from home, the staff here we consider family - we come to totally unwind, and unwind we do!! There are three restaurants - a thai restaurant, which offered a different set menu for every night of the week, a seafood restaurant, which also offers themed nights and a Mediterranean restaurant. All offer delicious food. There is a wonderful day spa in the resort. Slightly pricey, but a definite must at least once a visit! There are the ladies on the beach who also offer massages, and they are very cheap. If you can even be bothered venturing outside of Qunci from the time you arrive, until the time you depart.....We also eat at the many restaurants in sengiggi, which is a 10 minute taxi ride or scooter ride. Taxis cost approx 20000rps, plus a tip. Our Favourite eateries are The Square, food there would rival any of the top restaurants in Perth. The Taman, great food and they have a band that plays each evening, who are just delightful. There are a couple of great Italian eateries, cafe Alberta and another in the art centre... Can't recall the name right now. We definitely wouldn't recommend the fresh seafood place - Cafe Menega. The service is redicilously slow and food tends to come out totally charred... We have given this place three opportunities to better themselves and each time has been slightly worse than the previous! We sometimes hire scooters for approx 60,000rps per day and love to go on rides. The roads are in extremely good condition, and very open. If you do venture out, a must do is ride up to the cliff tops where the locals are selling fresh corn -15,000rps - they cook it on little wood fires and then coat it with a delicious sauce - amazing!! Just take some dental floss for that experience A day trip to the gili islands is great. Snorkeling and /or just relaxing when you get there. You can do that as costly or as cheaply as you like. We ride our bike to the local harbour - about 20 minutes away and catch the local boat across - costs about 50,000 rps per person - or there is also the option of a day trip with the guys on the beach out front of qunci, they charge approx 850,000rps to take you snorkeling off the three islands. We have done this and it's great too. So, in summary - we would recommend Qunci to anyone looking for a relaxing holiday, where you are treated like royalty!!Thanks Wiwit and all your wonderful staff, you are truly earthly Angels, and you sure are a blessing to everyone who crosses Qunci threshold. See you in March Marcus and Janine Perth"

","A marvellous and peaceful resort topped with world class service.","I had one of the best stays ever at Qunci Villas. The compound is beautifully landscaped and what can one ask for with 3 infinity pools, 3 restaurants and the wide open sea as a view. The grounds are always well tended and well manicured gardens. The food served at the restaurants were superbly delicious and they have special themed nights. The Garden View room was peaceful and the outdoor shower was interesting! Next, I moved to the Ocean View room. It was spectacular. Getting up in the morning and seeing the sea before you. One can also view the the lovely sunset right at the balcony. Wow. If I'm not mistaken, you can also see Kintamani in Bali. Lastly, I must make special mention to the attentive staff. Both my partner and I were nursing our wounds from a bad accident. We were well taken care of by the caring staff. Special shoutout to Ajir, Luhur, Rudy, Ahamadi, Muktar, Dayat (training) and also the lovely lady at the front desk who tended to us upon arrival (sorry can't rem her name). Anyway, they will really tend to our needs and make us feel comfortable. Just to cite an example, on the paella themed night, it was buffet style. We had to walk over to get our food. Due to our inability to walk much, the staff would serve the food to us. They told us to sit back and relax while they grab the food for us and brought it personally to our table. Not only that, they even checked back with us on the food and even for a second helping. They helped us with that second helping too. I'm touched by such wonderful service. Thank you all once again and I'll definitely stay there again. It was worth every penny."

","Spa to die for!","We stayed at the Qunci Villas and can't say enough positive things about the resort. The food at the Japanese restaurant in the resort was the best for both presentation and taste. The service was impeccable. My wife did a three hour spa and had a scrub, message, facial, etc. the highlight was taking a bath with lime slices and a flower bath. The room was very clean and the Internet worked well enough to do FaceTime with people back in the states. The bed was very comfortable and the grounds very quiet. We would not hesitate to stay there again if we ever return to Lombok."

","Better than expected!","Qunci villas offered more than I expected. The grounds were beautiful, the restaurants were cool and the food was good! It was extremely easy to set up the activities we wanted - went snorkeling to the gilis one day and hired a driver to take us to the kuta beaches another. The latter was slightly more than we expected to pay, but only about $10USD. The staff was nice and accommodating and the pool area was beautiful, especially at sunset. The only downfall was that there must be a mosque very close to the north side of the complex because the calls to prayer were EXTREMELY loud (esp at 4:30am), but seemed much quieter when walking to the side were the private villas were."

","Great!","Amazing resort with extremely friendly staff. Facilities are well maintained and the architecture is to die for. The hotel has two restaurants (1 serving more Asian style food, the other Mediterranean ) both of them with with choices that will fit in with everyone's tastes. Happy-Hour on cocktails by the pool was an experience out of this world. Will definitely recommend either to ""Honeymooners"" or couples with babies."

","Feels like home with an excellent ambience!!","Me and my husband visited Qunci Villas at June 2010, it was our second honeymoon (our first was also to Lombok :) Nice welcoming with a cold drink and fresh towel, nice staff, and the gardens are beautiful. The room has a balcony that are really perfect for relaxing, but you can see your next door's doing, either their clothes hanging or just them relaxing in the balcony. You should try the spa too,. My favorite is the bathroom, the shower has no ceiling, so you can take shower and watching birds and clouds and the sounds of the beach,perfect!! Qunci villas has their own private beach and great foods while enjoying the beach. The breakfast is good too. Very recommended!"

","Most relaxing getaway plus the great service ","We stayed in Villa 9 initially but due to some pest, we transferred immediately to another room and we were make sure that we are comfortable and not disturbed through out the stay. The stay is very comfortable and relaxing. Great pool and great view. My next visit there will definitely be in pool villas. My ocean view was great. Waking up to the sunrise is memorable. Also great spa too. Also kudos to the staff for all the great service. Would have given 5* if we weren't disturbed by the bugs on the first night. Overall recommended to everyone especially couples."

","Most Beautiful Resort EVER !!!","The Qunci Villas Boutique Hotel (Senggigi Lombok) was one of the most beautiful resorts I've had the pleasure to experience. Most people go to the Gili Islands. Too busy!!! Lombok is the island to visit to really experience Bali. The people were friendly and accommodating, the rooms, we're lovely, the grounds were beautifully landscaped and well kept, and the pool / beach area was absolutely luxurious and comfortable. We enjoyed amazing massages, delicious meals ... Especially breakfast, which was included. It was a great value for what we paid. We were there nov 2014 which was low season so it was inexpensive to start with and then they gave us a free upgrade. (Don't know why it was low season, the weather was perfect). I absolutely recommend Qunci Villas"

","Beautiful relaxing spot and good value","Qunci is great - a haven of peace and tranquility with a lovely beach, great staff, good food and an amazing spa. It's the kind of place we would definitely return to as we feel it's the kind of place you can continue to enjoy more each time you come! I didn't take any photos and to be honest, the official ones are a pretty accurate representation of what it's like. The grounds are meticulously maintained, as are the three gorgeous infinity pools - lounging in any of them you have a fabulous view of the vast ocean and the volcano of Bali peaking through the clouds as fisherman wade in the water casting their lines and small boats set off around the headland as the sun sets and you sip a refreshing G&T. We came to Qunci after reading a blog by a Japanese family who visited with their kids. We have a 19 month old daughter and wanted a break to relax and do nothing for ten days before Xmas. My husband works in Indonesia for five months every year, so we were keen to have some family time not too far from home in Aus and also experience another Indonesian island.The rooms at Qunci are beautifully designed and are practical as well as aesthetic. Restaurants are good - we liked sitting at the Nooq bar, looking out at the ocean in the late afternoon and had breakfast at Quali. Some of the dishes weren't as good as others but we found our favourites and thoroughly enjoyed them - Vietnamese beef noodle salad was amazing and my husband was addicted to the beef burger with pimiento cheese, which was first class. Breakfast was substantial and delicious - fresh juices, a range of international options and the chef was happy to make things for our daughter that were not on the menu, which was much appreciated. Nothing was too much trouble - we were granted late check out as out flight was not until 5:25pm and we wanted our daughter to have a good nap before we left and staff were provided to babysit on two occasions we wanted to leave our daughter sleeping, while we ate at the restaurant. Ok, now to one criticism. Upon arrival we were put in room 4. The mosque is very close to this room and the call to prayer was super loud - as if the Immam was in our bathroom! We understand that when visiting a Muslim country this is a reality and a part of life, but it was really affecting us as it would wake our daughter up at 4:30 every morning (and therefore us) and we like zombies for the first few days. We thought it was unavoidable until we spoke to some other guests who said they don't hear it hardly at all. So we then asked to move rooms, which we did no problem and it was soooo much better. Unfortunately the first half of our holiday was significantly impacted by this and if the staff had the foresight to think about a couple travelling with a baby and that it might not be cool to have them on that side of the resort, our discomfort could have been avoided. Ok, back to the good stuff! The spa is truly sensational - I have been to many in Australia and the UK and the treatments I received at Qamboja were fabulous. The whole experience is very relaxing and special, right from the lemongrass cooler drink and cold mint infused flannel you receive before you start, to the warming ginger tea afterwards. I even fell asleep during one massage, which is very unlike me as I find it hard to unwind, so that was a major plus!I am only sorry I didn't have a chance to do the yoga that is on offer every morning or learn to surf - you can hire boards and lessons and the conditions out front are perfect for learning - small, gentle surf. The demands of a toddler meant we could not do everything. Plus, we need to save something for next year...we would love to return ;)"

","Beautiful and relaxing stay.... pity there were no fans","Qunci villas is just stunning. The gardens are amazing, lovely pools (and great to have smoke free and kid free optons) and friendly staff. The rooms are very tastefully done with really comfortable beds with quality mattresses. The restaurants serve top quality food and while it's obviously pricey by Lombok standards, it's pretty good value compared to other resorts (just remember there's 21% added to everything at the end). Being pregnant I was also really impressed with the non-alcoholic drink options at the bars.We booked an ocean view room and had requested a top floor room but were given a ground floor one. They graciously moved us after a day though. The top floor rooms are more private (but wouldn't be good with a small child ) and you can have the doors open all night to let in the breeze. Which brings me to my main problem with Qunci Villas.... and it's the same problem I have with many top notch resorts - particularly those that claim eco-friendly credentials with the odd sign about re-using your towel, or some recycled paper here and there. There was no fan in the room. Only air conditioining. And the windows were sealed shut. And the doors have no fly screen on them so you can't really leave them open and enjoy the natural sea breeze. We did try the non-AC option on our second night when in the upstairs room but after getting bitten by a mosquito at about 1am we shut the doors and locked ourselves into the unnatural aiconditioned environment. Had there have been a ceiling fan we could have used that and the breeze to remain comfortable and mosquito free all day and night. And THAT would have been eco-friendly. I know I'm not alone in disliking sleeping under an AC, and enjoying natural breeze and fans, yet more and more top end places - like Qunci - don't have fans. Just airconditioners and blankets / duvets to snuggle under and pretend you're not in the tropics. And use copious amounts of electricity. One other tiny issue - they don't seem to check emails. I emailed twice in a week asking to arrange an airport transfer but no response. Instead I had to call from overseas - then they were very courteous and professional. Despite the AC issue we would return to Qunci Villas. It really is a lovely place and the staff are fantastic. And I guess I'll ask for a portable fan next time. Or hope they've installed some in the rooms.... a small upfront cost for a long term saving."

","Nearly Flawless","My wife and I visited Qunci for our 5 year wedding anniversary. We chose the room with the private pool and were given one called Qambala. The setting, room and decor were all absolutely stunning. It was lit up beautifully at night, with lights in the trees and candles on the tables. The restaurants were great, with the lunch menu standing out the most. The drinks were disappointingly small, but the 'rehydrator' especially was delicious.The experience was marred by two things; privacy and our arrival. We chose the private pool because my wife and I are Muslim and would like to be able to swim in privacy. However the private pool was not really private, with bizarre gaps near the door that let people see in. I really find this baffling, as the Island is majority Muslim so I assume the private pools are partly to cater to that audience. The cleaning staff would come to the door, and when I was swimming in the pool I could see them looking in as they rang the bell. I can't really blame them for that as the holes in the wall shouldn't have been there in the first place!The other issue was that we were offered a pick up from the nearby town. This was free so we were grateful. We were not however grateful when we were left waiting in the sun for 20 minutes at the place we had arranged to be picked up... at which point we took refuge in a cafe (it was very hot) and emailed reception asking about our pick up. It took them more than an hour to reply, and they told us the driver was there. He wasn't. When he finally picked us up (2 hours later) he implied we were lying and that he was at the spot where we were waiting. Why would we lie about it and email reception at the time? It didn't make sense and was quite insulting. When we turned up, reception didn't say anything, no apology, nothing.It is a testament to how absolutely amazing Qunci villas is that these two things didn't stop a 5 star rating. The indoor shower, the bed, everything was awesome. The breakfast too. Near flawless, I'm sorry I had to dwell on the two things that broke the spell."

","Food is the best!","We are currently here on a 5D4N stay. Staying in the Qinggrass, which is the villa with a private pool. My girls (1 & 3 yr olds) love the pool. It is clean and doesn't have a gross slimy feeling on the bottom of the pool which usually occurs to private pools that have been around for quite some time. At the first impression, the staff weren't as warm as other 5-star resorts we have been to but over time, the staff came across as helpful and willing to assist all they can. The best part here is the BREAKFAST! Gosh! Where do I start? All I can say is that the breakfast (ala carte) served here is one of the best we have ever eaten in a resort. U can eat by the pool, there are more than 8 varieties of meals to choose from. It is seriously heavenly. As for dinner, we had it at Quah Restaurant (Mediterranean w/ Lombok touch), it was great too! Tonight (wed night) is BBQ dinner. We are pretty sure we are not gonna be disappointed. In summary, Qunci is a great villa for the stay and the food."

","Truly exemplifies the term idlliyc Lombok.","Stayed here for 5D4N to chillax after hectic business trip in SingaporeResort is nice and room was excellent. We got the partial sea view which was beautiful. The star of the resort was the staff. Who went all out to make us feel comfortable.However beach front sea was too rough for swimming and Rocky. If beach and sunbathing is your scene go to Gili.Restaurants are alright and prices reasonable."

","Would give six stars but Tripadvisor only allows 5 max!","General - Great, amazing place! Everything about this hotel is soooo sooo nice! From the well-manicured grounds, great food, great poolside/beachside hangout places, evening themed dinners, happy hour, spa, room, service, people, atmosphere - I just can't fault it. It's a hotel that should be classified as a destination in itself - you come here to enjoy the hotel, waste your time doing nothing but relaxing, swimming, eating, drinking and be very, very relaxed and happy (and well fed)! I can see this place as somewhere you would go after you take your PADI license at one of the Gilis, a couple of nights here before your flight back. We were planning to do lots of things in Lombok but the temptation to just chill is too great! The airport pickup service worked very well, and I slept during the 90 mins drive from the airport to the hotel. We passed Senggigi and other hotels/resorts that we previously considered (and fortunately didn't go for!). There are probably 1-2 restaurants near Qunci and a mini mart, but that's it as far as outside facilities are concerned. But read on, you'll see that you won't need anything else outside Qunci!Room - we paid a bit more but on a discounted rate (as we prepaid fully - check their website for offers!) for an ocean view room. And boy was it worth every penny! We had room no. 28, which was by the non-smoking pool/deck area (probably for kids but there weren't many kids around at this time of year), overlooking the beach, on the second floor. Always go for second floor as you get better view and privacy. We had our breakfast on our balcony almost every day (for no extra fee), otherwise you can have it right by the beach. It was exactly as shown in the website - just amazing. The bathroom is open air, so it does get a bit hot (in July/August I can imagine myself getting sweaty again right after a shower). No tub but you probably won't use it, but if you're desperate, there's always the spa! We get a couple of mineral water bottles everyday, which is enough. Everything about this hotel is designed with an artistic intention - there is art everywhere and the architecture and furniture seemed to have been carefully designed. I think even the crockery was designed for the hotel (and would I love to get a set!!!). Air conditioning is perfect, bed size and firmness is perfect, and the room is well proportioned. Turndown service is a standard every evening.The three infinity-ish pools are all good, with the adult-only pool (next to the Nooq bar which was unfortunately used for some kind of meeting/training when we were there) being the smallest. The main pool has good length for your laps (would need it to burn off those extra calories...). There were several bale (gazebos) that we turned into our temporary living quarters... no matter where the sun is, you are well covered (so unless you want to get a tan, this is where you could stay all day...). You could get drinks all day, all at reasonable prices (especially if you convert to poundsterling!!). Towels are always available and there is always someone there to take your orders of food/drinks from the restaurant. There are some sellers just on the beach, but they are not too aggressive and will not set foot on the hotel grounds. Once you say no nicely, they generally will leave you alone. I think it might be busier during peak season though. The beach is nice enough, some areas have black volcanic sand and some is covered with dead coral so invest on good beach shoes. The beach stretches a bit to the north towards Malimbu cliffs, so you can have a good walk that way. The biggest question I had before coming here (and still unanswered) is whether you could do some snorkelling off the beach in front of the hotel - in short, we did not see anyone doing that and in my opinion the waves (and probably the current) are a bit too strong anyway. I saw some people trying to surf/body boards and someone did some sailing. Just left of the hotel on the beach there is a shack that rents out surf boards/body boards, so I guess it is probably a surfable sea. We went to Gili Meno to do some snorkelling and spent a day there, which we think is probably about right for us. We hired a speedboat from lombokspeedboat.com for a return trip from Teluk Nare (around 20 mins drive to the north from Qunci) - as I get seasick very easily. That worked well, a tad expensive, but it's less hassle (they also drive you to/from Teluk Nare). The speedboat dropped us off in front of Mahamaya, which is a nicer, quieter part of Gili Meno in our opinion. Only a whole day of snorkelling and we were already looking forward to chill in Qunci!Wifi is excellent throughout the resort, even right by the beach where I typed this review with a glass of pure sugarcane drink in my other hand (multitasking at its best). There has been some very occasional drops but generally really good, good enough to fro FaceTime and stream Netflix (get PureVPN!) - this is important because there is no TV anywhere and we are 21st century 30-something folks that will go crazy without some mind-numbing digital entertainment.  We will be back again, as this place has successfully ruined all other hotels in Lombok for us! We are quite the hotel connoisseur and so far this place is probably the hardest hotel to checkout from!"

","Probably best hotel in the Senggigi area","The Qunci Villas offer great atmosphere compared with other properties in Lombok. I only know one other hotel in Lombok which would top it.The Management is obviously hard working on bringing in some good standard to the property. Not easy if you consider the usual low service standard when it comes to local staff. Rooms and garden are beautiful set. The Restaurants cater with real delights. Go there for desserts!The property is right at the beach side. Offers nice vista. All in all a great hotel.The only minus points I have are the room rates. At least $50/night over priced. And the little space provided for parking. And as always in Indonesian hotels. The staff needs some real training in regards to service and how to communicate with guests."

","Absolute Perfection","We stayed a Qunci for our last 4 nights if our 13 night holiday and it was perfect. We were a little worried when we pulled up to Senggigi in the fast boat, but when we got to Qunci our fears melted. What a place! We booked a partial ocean view but basically got a full ocean view. Rooms are huge a lovely with great decor. Service is immaculate and I mean immaculate. The staff are so lovely friendly and helpful.Now the restaurants are simply the best! Breakfast so many choices, lunch again so many choices and delicious. Dinner at all 3 restaurants were just perfection and we are really into our food. Our tip is to try the daily changing Thai Set Menu a Nooq bar amazing value and food was amazing. Make the most of there awesome cocktails at happy hour they are delicious and strong.We booked the Jetlag package at the Spa and that was really relaxing.The only downfall for us was Senggigi itself, wasn't much too see and obviously business is slow so haggling is worse than the main land in my opinion. That was fine it was our last 4 nights so we just utilised Qunci and all it had to offer."

","Idyllic but","I chose to come to Qunci simply based on TA reviews. I do agree the setting could not be more gorgeous, the grounds, the artwork, the cleverly designed layout of the villas, the architect could not have done a better job it is all perfect. We were picked up by Heru at the airport nice guy he even took my husband for a surf. I booked 5 nights in an ocean view room spent extra because it was our 20 year anniversary n asked for a quiet room. I could not be more pleased when we were shown to our room it was the one on the website! Score! Or so I thought. The view is amazing but if you want to sit out on the balcony you look straight down onto the hawkers gathering area. The pool is right next to the room another score. It is a non smoking pool to cater for the kiddies. Then the hawkers light up not so smoke free now.My husband not so bothered by them but I am . I figure if I want to haggle for their wares I would have stayed in Bali. I knew about the hawkers from previous reviews but when they call out to you and stare when you are trying to relax on your own balcony and enjoy the sound of the waves crashing and the view it gets annoying. In this room you cannot escape them. I hve a few observances about the room that I would like to give to management so I'm hoping they have feedback forms or such at the end of our stay tomorrow. Now the service. The spa is a must do the ladies there do an amazing job! Exy but well worth it. We have had excellent service from Maryam and Sule at the sunset bar they went out of their way for us asking our names and remembering them. We visited them a couple of times. The waiters n waitresses pleasant enough but not falling over themselves to make you feel warm n fuzzy. They certainly do listen to requests and fulfill any needs you have. Bonus. Pool attendants? I had to go looking for them. I also organised a romantic dinner for our anniversary which we had last night. I watched them set up several huts so I see the work that goes into it. The food I was not overly impressed with neither was my husband. The only dish I was completely satisfied with was the beef. The dishes lacked flavour but we did eat it all thou because we were hungry! The wine we didn't drink as we didn't like it. The value of this splurge def not there. But the setting was romantic so I supposed that made up for it. The food at the restaurants is at a good level and reasonably priced. I did find the cooked breakfasts oily thou. Menu choice good and fruit plate nice way to start the day. To end this review if you want complete privacy if u can afford get a private pool villa. This place is amazingly well thought out the furniture the artworks the gardens just spectacular and even more beautiful at night with the lights on you could not ask for a more romantic setting. Thank you Qunci villas this was a memorable trip."

","Relaxing & Great Value","We stayed for 2 nights in a garden view room with the outdoor bathroom. Wish we had more time there and would go back again! The room was lovely, the staff is very helpful and friendly, and the food is delicious. No complaints! Certainly not the place for loud groups as it is a quiet sanctuary of sorts and offers a place for lazy days at the pool, quiet naps and, fine dining.We took a chance and went during the rainy season, in November, and it wasn't a problem at all. Our first day was all sun and the next morning rained, but cleared up later in the morning. The hotel will help you organize a trip to the Gili's for the day if you want to go snorkelling. It's 45 min. each way on a small wood boat and we went from 9am-4pm with a stop for lunch. The local boat driver got in the water with us and had bread to attract the fish. We met the boat guy on the beach side of the resort and his boat was just a few steps away. Good day trip!The food was delicious. Open air restaurants with great service. The included breakfast offers a nice menu. You will leave each meal stuffed if you choose to only eat in the resort restaurants. Make sure you try the Sea Bass with Chimichurri. Be mindful of what you leave out in the rooms as they come through with a bug spray. If you are worried about your toothbrush, for example, you might want to keep it away. I don't mind it as we didn't have a problem with mosquitos. You can hear the prayers, but it is not disruptive especially if you ask for a villa closer to the beach side. No need to look for another spot. This resort will exceed your expectations."

","Great location and good value","Wonderful service, and the location was perfect. Beach front pools and dining at a very good price. Their western style restaurant had delicious food. The asian style restaurant food was too salty but after we asked for less salt on food, it was delicious. Their happy hour was a little bit disappointing as they exclude beer and wine, only cocktails. All of their room is good and of same style with balinese outdoor shower without bathtubs. I recommend upstairs villa (of any kind) for extra privacy."

","Wonderful hotel and staff","We stayed at Qunci for 4 nights at the beginning of November and absolutely loved it. The hotel is set in beautiful grounds by the beach and has a number of swimming pools. There are 3 restaurants (one is smaller and quieter than the others and accommodates a bar) and all are open air, beautifully appointed and stylish. If you don't want to eat in the dining area you can eat in the grounds by the beach. Food was very good and reasonably priced. Breakfast was included and there were various options to choose from, which we preferred to the usual buffet as it limited waste and we didn't end up overeating. The grounds are spectacular - well designed with trees and plants everywhere. There is wonderful art throughout the property and in the rooms. The rooms are in low rise (2 storey) buildings and are a good size and comfortable. Each room has a good sized private patio, they are all air-conditioned (absolutely necessary in Lombok) and the bathroom is open air. Above all the staff (all young) were wonderful, very attentive and helpful in every area of the property. A special mention to Has, Andri and Lahur. It was incredibly hot and humid while we were there and, as we were only there for a few days, we ended up staying most of the time at the hotel by the pool as there was usually a light breeze and it was never crowded. There are a fair number of vendors on the beach but we didn't have any problems and they seemed to be a good-natured bunch. We had a meal in town one night (about a 5 minute cab ride for $2) at Quake, a restaurant owned by Qunci, which basically serves much the same food and from memory was a bit cheaper (and very good). It's about and hour and 15 minutes or so from the airport, depending on traffic, which gave us the chance to see something of the island (very quiet south of Mataram, very busy north of it). The hotel arranged it for us, the car was very comfortable and it cost $30.All in all, this hotel is great, we will definitely visit again and would highly recommend it."

","Heavenly..","We decided to pamper ourselves after the mount rinjani climb by staying at a nice resort. We picked Qunci and did not regret a single bit. The pool Villa that we stayed at is spacious and nice. Only complain was the floor wasn't clean properly and you can still feel some residue of massage oil when you walked on it. We love the restaurants and especially the idea of dining next to the beach. The spa is great and the masseurs did a great job. We had an early flight on the day we were checking out and the resort specially arranged an early breakfast for us which we thought was really nice. Overall, Qunci is a great place to rejuvenate and I really miss the time lazing around their beautiful pool area..."

","Amazing honeymoon!!!","We stayed 5 nights in a private villa with pool for our honeymoon. Didn't want to leave! Our villa was fairly large & we loved breakfast delivered to our villa to have by our pool or down by the beach when we could drag ourselves out. The resort grounds are beautiful-great beach & ocean views. 3 pools were stunning & not very busy which was good to find a sun bed during the day. The spa there is top notch-very professional & calming/relaxing. Staff super friendly & food yummy. We only left the resort once during our whole stay & we didn't even really need to. Highly recommend this resort to anyone who is looking for a quite getaway & we are already thinking of when we are coming back again"

","Lovely place....one disappointment ","We are a couple in our early 30's who are currently staying in the partial ocean view room. I booked this resort months ago and have been so excited to arrive as the photos on the website are beautiful. When we arrived, we were not disappointed, the perfectly manicured gardens and surrounds are glorious and the layout of the resort is clever. We have swum in all three pools and the water is perfect. Good idea to supply towels to your guests on the sunbeds, little things like that are appreciated. Staff have been incredible, very attentive and friendly. We have encountered some beautiful people while staying here. I wish I could remember everyone's names. Andi, the young driver who picked us up from the port, has been a standout, as well as 'Ris' (?) from the main pool bar area. My partner and I enjoyed the Qunci Wake Up Call spa treatment yesterday at the spa and both ladies were excellent - I even booked a 90 minute Swedish massage for today. The room itself is very spacious, good air con, massive comfy bed, large balcony, great views of the grounds, an outdoor shower which is a nice change. No complaints there. We have enjoyed breakfast - eggs benedict, Aussie breakfast and farmers breakfast - down in the restaurant which is so relaxing, practically on the beach, listening to the waves...heaven. The juices, coffee, tea and meals were great, eggs cooked to perfection. We had lunch by the pool two days, club sandwich, vegetable and goats cheese baguette, basil chilli beef, seafood Mie Goreng, all have been pleasant. Cocktails going down a treat, good variety, nice strength/mix and happy hour 5-7pm is a perfect way to watch the sun go down. Ok, now for something that has greatly been a disappointment. First of all, I'm not one to complain or write a negative review unless it is warranted and I hate to have anything negative to say about Qunci at all as we have been thoroughly enjoying our stay...up until the romantic dinner we had last night. Again, this is something I booked months ago and have been really looking forward to as a highlight of our holiday, even more so since three days ago on this trip my partner proposed and we are now engaged(!!) We were hoping this dinner would be spectacular. It was not. My first disappointment was the entree chicken ballotine, my understanding of a ballotine is chicken deboned and rolled in cling wrap, poached or roasted (sometimes with stuffing or other ingredients inside) then fried to give a crispy outer layer. What I got was cut up bits of chicken in a cabbage leaf ?! I didn't think it was nice at all, quite bland and flavourless, I couldn't eat it after a couple bites. My partner had prawns which he said were average. The next course I had beef rendang which was ok but not great, again I couldn't finish this dish. Main was a big disappointment, the beef was almost well done when I had requested medium, the meat was so salty I only had two bites, my partner took two bites also to try, I had to eat the chickpea patty to counteract the salt. The celery sauce was not to my taste. However, my partner did enjoy his prawn main course and said it was beautiful. The lovely young waiter did ask how the meal was and I was honest with him and told him the beef was way too salty, and I couldn't eat it. He was kind enough to offer to redo the dish but by this stage it was after 9pm and my appetite had subsided and I was a little past trying to enjoy the meal (sorry!). The only dish I could finish was the caramel molten dessert, a little grainy but it was sweet and nice. The best part of the meal was the red wine. I do appreciate the attempt of rectifying the main by redoing the dish but for what we paid, I believe we did not receive the quality of meal we were hoping for. The whole experience was very sub-par for the amount of money we paid, as it was a little splurge for us. It's a shame and we feel let down but are hoping this does not hinder the rest of our stay in this idyllic place."

The pools are beautiful and well maintained and the artwork and small details are a delight.Thank you to Rudy and Evi for the great service and to Farosh for the touring and conversations.We are already planning our return.

","Stunning and elegant","We stayed in an Ocean View room, and it was worth every penny. It is absolute beachfront. The staff are attentive and well trained. The grounds are beautiful and luxurious and very well kept. The room is decorated in a tasteful style, and has the traditional roof and decent-sized balcony over looking the ocean and grounds. The bathroom is open air, modern and elegant, like everything at the hotel.The 3 pools and in particular the main pool are gorgeous and come with jaw dropping views of the ocean. You can order snacks and drinks from the pool, and we took advantage of happy hour every evening and enjoyed some delicious cocktails watching the sunset. Personally, I didn't enjoy the touts calling at us to buy things from the edge of the property while we were getting into the pool or swimming in the pool; contrary to what others have said, a polite ""no thank you"" didn't work and you might get followed up and down the length of the pool if you try to politely move away. But it's a small thing in the scheme of things and overall I really loved the pool area which is a major highlight of the grounds. The food was fantastic. I loved the Asian tapas restaurant (we both ate at the restaurant and had room service)....so delicious. We ordered various things from the room service menu and all of them were delicious. Qunci was a highlight of our 1 month trip across Bali and Lombok. I will definitely be back to Qunci: next time I will spend longer and probably fly directly into Lombok which is quieter than Bali and has lots of natural beauty. Qunci really is an amazing getaway - a destination in itself."

","Simply Amazing!! Already planning the next trip back!","The only place to stay when visiting Lombok, Qunci Villas exceeded all our expectations! Although we only stayed for 4 days - time really does slow down to an island pace at this resort, and it really was so hard to leave! We stayed in a partial ocean view room, and it was beautiful -complete with a balcony lounge area, and outdoor bathroom!I am usually the type of holiday-maker who cannot sit still and has to be constantly doing something or going somewhere... but Qunci Villas turned that around as we could barely bring ourself to leave... even for our planned day tours! The resort has three restaurants, with a great selection of cuisines and drinks that kept us coming back for more... there was really no need at all to leave such a paradise.Also the beach side dining for breakfast and dinner on the deck, is truly something amazing and really makes your getaway that much more special.We cannot wait to return, and are already planning our next trip back!!"

","Beautiful quiet resort","We have just returned from Lombok staying at Qunci Villas for 7 glorious days.We stayed in a garden view villa no 14 which had the best view to the sea for this room type, we could sit in our veranda and have glimpses of the ocean.The grounds of the resort are beautiful and the 3 pools were never crowded.The food in the restaurants were excellent with a very good vegetarian menu, just ask to see the vegetarian menu and the staff will bring it. We didn't find it too expensive either so ate most nights in the resort.Breakfast is interesting in which you get a serve of fruit, fruit juice, tea or coffee and then you can choose all these different types of breakfast from Mexican to Spanish, Aussie and Indonesian to name a few, very tasty and not too salty like a lot of other reviews.The staff, from the restaurant staff to pool staff and even the gardeners were all very friendly and genuinely friendly not just doing their job to be polite.We did have a few minor hiccups which were quickly rectified and a special thank you to the restaurant manager as we thoroughly enjoyed our BBQ dinner and drinks by the ocean front.Sunsets amazing or was that the happy hour cocktails !Beach sellers weren't a problem, quite fun to watch and chat to.We can't wait to return for another holiday at beautiful Qunci Villas."

","THE Place To Stay On Lombok","Just returned from 2 weeks staying in Qumbang Luxury Villa @ Qunci Villas. Wished we could have stayed longer and I nearly cried when we left. Qumbang is on the hill across the road from the resort and we really loved having that bit extra privacy and space. Free transport is provided to the resort but we preferred to walk, that way you get a real feel for Mangsit and the locals. All the staff are extremely nice and friendly and very good at their jobs. Everyone was ready with a smile and greeting and we immediately felt welcomed, would have to be the best we have experienced. Spa ladies fantastic, both Deann & Mardi did a great massage. Ayu @ Quali, Esty @ Nooq, Ely (You're Welcome) @ Quai, and all the others, I wish I could remember all your names, you made our stay especially special. Also a thanks to the chefs for the lovely food in all restaurants, and all the guys working in the background doing dishes and laundry, and the staff and Andi for looking after our villa.We did two day tours with local village brothers Bahram & Ary, you can find Bahram on the beach infront and we can highly recommend them both. Local villagers are selling lovely sarongs and freshwater pearl jewelry etc on the beach, if you are not interested just say No Thank You and they will leave you alone. Of course they are always keen to do a deal, always with a smile.Thank you everyone for an extremely lovely holiday that we will remember forever."

","Died and gone to heaven","A fantastic combination of the beach and beautiful tropical gardens. Rooms where lovely and clean /spacious. Bathroom was magnificent with outdoor shower.Although I had seen photos on tripadvisor I couldn't hide my excitement on arrival to find that it was even more stunning.Staff where very friendly and always had a welcoming smile. The three infinity pools yes I said three meant that it was never crowded or you had to fight to get a deck chair.Breakfast was severed looking at the waves on the beach. The spa was heaven and treatment of a high standard.The food and drink where a reasonable price, I had expected them to have cost a small fortune at such a upper end resort. Folks not a bogan insite here. I looked at other resorts on either side and I have to say they didn't even enter the race. Please note if you like night life don't come here expecting any I think this resort would be suited to couples, honeymooners or folks happy to entertain themselves. Note if your comparing Lombok to Bali I think you get a better class of hotel for less in Lombok but far less to do so my advise would be to splurge and stay here."

","Terrific","We spent four nights at Qunci Villas. At the end, we left the place grudgingly and telling ourselves we would come back for sure. Our Partial Ocean View room, spacious and well organized, was above our expectations. Quietness and privacy are guaranteed. The tasteful decoration of all the resort facilities, not limited to the the rooms, is outstanding. One can notice an artistic touch all over. We enjoyed the breakfast menu very much, and again we were very impressed by its excellent presentation. Our last dinner at Quali seafood restaurant was great. The staff have a good training. They are attentive and kind at all times. I personally appreciate the fact that local people in Lombok are usually quite respectful, and don't tend to get too amusing with tourists. My only criticism is for the smoking policy of the resort, which should take into consideration the small swimming pool bar too. Smoking should not be allowed there, at least in the tables were meals are served. We highly recommend Qunci Villas for a fabulous romantic breakaway to Lombok, an island which still grants the pleasant backwardness that its neighbor Bali already lost."

","Fabulous...","We spent a week at Quinci last February.2 adults and 2 elementary children.We actually extended several nights as we liked the resort that much.Things we liked:Excellent villas (pool villas were fantastic, private and lovely... One had a slight musty smell, but not at all bothersome... The artwork in 1 room was also a bit ominous but we just laughed about it :)Way above par service... Nothing was too much to ask, even contacting a doctor when our daughter had a medical scare...Food: reasonable price, delicious and fantastic kids meals with real food not junk that many hotels try to pass off as food for kids :)Help planning outing: Rinjani, Gilis, etc.. All perfect and fun..it poured at Rinjani but we sat perched above waterfalls and rice patties- enjoying the beauty of the storm...Spa... Excellent -Can't wait to return!"

","Beautiful Hotel, Lovely Beach","This hotel is out of our normal price range, we booked it for a treat for our honeymoon. The hotel has beautiful pools, comfortable rooms. Our room view was of a wall, but hey I guess someone has to be the person facing the wall! We had garden view, and there were a few plants between us and the wall. We were on the first floor, and the patio was large and comfortable. Walking down the beach there is just beautiful, although a bit rough for swimming (but you have the pools for that!). Breakfast was great, and service was fabulous.. for sure get what you pay for there. We had to do some travel changes due to a hiccup in plans and the front desk staff went above and beyond to help us. Amazing the lengths they will go to. So impressed. It was a bit old people/family oriented for us, but that is completely subjective."

","It's all good, but the food is the real winner.","As good all around as all the rest have said. We found that the food was way better than anywhere else. Croissants as good as European. Very creative breakfasts too. Never went out for dinner anywhere else and their menu is large enough that there's always something new to try, even when there for a week, as we just were. Reasonably priced too, which may have more to do with our strong dollar there. Would have liked to have seen Hatten Wine as a house wine though. Good as but cheaper than Plaga. The other (imported) wines were astronomical, which is par for the course on Bali."

","Fabulous in every way!!","We have just returned form 7 nights in an ocean view room at Qunci Villas hotel. I would have to say that this was the best hotel/resort we have ever stayed at. Our room (no 53) had the best view of one of the pools and the ocean. We could also lie in the cool of our room and watch the spectacular sunset!! The room was immaculate, serviced beautifully everyday and turndown service in the evening. The massages and scrub treatments in the spa were amazing and very reasonably priced. Thank you to my massage therapists Sari, War and Wulan for making my experience so relaxing. All of the staff at Qunci were very friendly, professional and went out of their way to make our holiday extremely enjoyable and relaxing. Special mention must go to Andi by the pool!! He catered to our every need in regards to food, drinks, general information about Lombok and just lovely conversation about anything!! Working with him was a lovely trainee called Dewat (think that is how you spell his name) - only 15years old but he had a lovely, friendly manner and beautiful smile! He will do well in his chosen career. In fact, Qunci has many trainees working in the restaurants and pool areas. It is lovely to see local young people being given the opportunity to work in such a wonderful environment.As Qunci is positioned right on the water's edge, there is always a lovely cool breeze even though the temperature was about 33 degrees everyday. All of the pools are exceptionally clean and well maintained, with very comfortable lounges amongst the frangipani trees. There are about half a dozen regular souvenir sellers on the beach in front of the hotel. They can be a bit annoying but generally leave you alone if you say ""No thank you""!! The sarongs and pearl bracelets are quite nice - best bargaining is done when there is a group of people buying so you can get an idea of best price. Unfortunately, we got ""ripped off"" by one of the sellers when we tried to buy a pearl necklace - he gave us a price and then took double the money when we got a bit confused with the local currency. We didn't realise until we sat down and by then the seller had disappeared. The other sellers were very upset this had happened to us and tried to find him! Lesson learnt is always take your time when bargaining and handing over money!! Maybe the hotel could advise the sellers to look after their guests if they are going to let them operate there - buying while sitting on the beach was actually a lovely way to shop!We sampled most of the food in the restaurants and beside the pool - all great quality and reasonably priced. Two for one cocktails during happy hours 5-7pm were enjoyed most nights!!We will recommend Qunci to all our friends and family. Hopefully we can return soon for another week of pure relaxation!!"

","Lombok's Finest","Wow, what can I say!! We spent 4 nights at Qunci at the end of October this year and from the moment we arrived we knew this was a special place. Just to let you know that my girlfriend and I are in our mid 30's and love sun, swimming, exploring new cultures, relaxing, and food/wine.The grounds and layout is first class. The restaurants, pools, decking and sun lounges are smartly designed with phenominal views of tge ocean, sunsets, and across to Bali when its clear. The rooms were great and we loved the attention to detail. The service and food were first rate. We had some of our best meals for our whole trip to Indonesia here. We tried every dining option and enjoyed it all. Prices were excellent for the quality.The spa was heaven. I could hardly walk back to the pool after my massage because I was so relaxed.If you're after luxury at a great price, sun, swimming, water sports and great food and drinks then this is the spot. Also the weather was great for us in late October. It was not as stifling hot as southern Lombok which is much drier. 5/5 for us."

","Mixed Feelings","First off, Airport pickup was smooth as silk. Our driver Samsol (I think his name was) was a hands down class act. We spent the 1 hour drive talking Lombok: the culture, customs, religion, things to do, etc. He was warm and inviting and answered all the questions we had, as this was our first trip to Lombok. We also found out he's a Bon Jovi fan revealed by the excellent Classic Rock mix he had playing in the car (a nice touch for us Americans)! Bonus points from my Bon Jovi loving wife as well! Upon arrival it seemed this place was heaven as the grounds are immaculate. They really did a great job with all the water features, infinity pools, gardens and then nestling the hotel right up against a beautiful beach. However, our room was a little weak, and to be honest not in the best shape. All the handles (door/bath) were loose, lights were hanging on by wires, and overall had some signs of serious wear. We were super tired when we showed up, so we tried to go straight to bed. However, outside on the balcony there are two lights that you can't shut off and they shine into the room through a high window you can't cover. It was a struggle to sleep almost every night.The spa was pretty nice although they don't partition the rooms that well. So throughout our massage others were finishing next door talking and making lots of noise cleaning up, ultimately hindering the relax factor. I will say the quality of the massage is top notch though. I'll also mention, my wife got a sunburn on our last day and the people at the spa were kind enough to give us some extra Aloe Vera free of charge. That was a really nice gesture.Moving on to the food. I'll say breakfast was quite awesome. The really knocked it out of the park. The French Toast was a swirl of cinnamon emotions that transformed my taste buds into a chorus of tiny angels singing triumphant praise to the chef. The lunch and dinner were pretty solid as well with lots of options to keep most anyone satisfied. As I'm a creature of habit I often order the same dish on multiple occasions, and I couldn't help but be a little disappointed on consistency. Some days lunch and dinner would be great, then the following day I'd order the same thing and it would be wildly different. Final storygraph. We accidentally left a small bag behind in our room, and we were already almost to the airport when we realized it. Our driver (again Samsol) helped coordinate a Taxi to pick it up and bring it to the airport. The taxi driver must have drove like a madman with no regard for his or the lives of others as he was sweating, breathing heavy and had pulsing veins on his forehead and neck. But alas, we received our bag and it was another example of the staff going above and beyond. If I were to remove the people and disregard the service, I could honestly only rate this place 3 circles. However, due to the fact the staff treated us with such kindness and were always willing to help, I can't help but to remember this place a good stay."

","Great stay","Stayed for 6 nights in the ocean view room. Rooms were great, staff were friendly, the facilities are very good, if you just want to relax you wouldn't need to leave the hotel. It is not that cheap by indonesian prices, but i wouldn't say it is crazy expensive either. Would happily recommend friends to stay here. Staff member Katstrina by the pool was great, when some staff couldn't make a decision, he went out of his way to ensure it was done."

","A Little Piece of Heaven","Qunci Villas is one of the best place I've ever stayed in. The photos on its website, give little credit for the picturesque villa. I am definitely in awe when I first stepped into the location after checking in.As it was my first trip to Lombok, I included the airport transfer with the reservation. Upon arriving in Praya Airport, we were greeted with a big smile by the friendly and courteous driver, who waited for us at the airport for almost 3 hours after sending off some guests earlier. The vehicle that fetched us was new and comfortable which definitely was worth us paying extra for the airport transfer. The driver also gave us some clean towels and water which certainly feels like VIP treatment for us.Another wow factor for us was the fact that the room charge comes with complimentary breakfast, that gives you the option of having you first meal of the day at the restaurant or at your room (in our case at our balcony) . We tried one of each experience during our 3D2N stay. The latter is definitely good if you are rushing to check-out or go out in the morning. The breakfast menu comes with a generous selection of carefully-planned menus, that comes complete with fresh juice and coffee/tea. The villa is located relatively close to the Senggigi central area, where you can find a number of local roadside eateries. However, you can also opt to stay within the hotel premises as the villa comes complete with 2 restaurants and 1 restaurant-cum-bar. Qunci Villas offers an interesting mix of drinks, both alcohol and non-alcohol that gives guests the flexibility to try out their various drinks throughout the day (while tanning by the swimming pool, watching the sunset or even enjoying after-dinner drinks).We also purchased a Jet-Lag Recovery Spa add-on during the reservation. The venue for the spa was incredibly relaxing. The treatment is also one of the best spa treatment I ever experienced. The only drawback is that we did not have much option fin terms of the timing for the spa appointment. As we only had 1 full day in Lombok, we were hoping to travel out of the villa to explore more of Lombok after breakfast, but because we are only left with a 11 o clock appointment, we did not have much time to explore the city. It would have been more perfect if we had the choice to have the spa treatment in the evening before dinner time.Nonetheless, we managed to get a really good indoor table at the Quali for dinner that allows us to get a wonderful view of the Sasak dance performance over dinner. Quali was introduced to us as an Asian seafood restaurant, but the menu seems to be quite different from what I had imagined it to be. In the end, we chose Thai Green Curry and Madura Fried Noodles for our meal. The Madura Fried Noodles was so salty, we had trouble finishing the dish. The kitchen was nice enough to re-cook the dish for us but it was still too salty for our liking and they were so kind to have allowed us to change into another dish. We were told that many guests from the neighbouring hotels come to Qunci Villas for dinner, but we felt that dinner was not as incredible as what we had heard of it to be.Overall, we truly enjoyed our stay at Qunci Villas and we will definitely be back soon. Truly worth paying this place a visit if you want to have a truly relaxed holiday."

","a bit disappointing for the price","not a big fan of this place - the sunset villas should be called 'glimpse of sunset' villas! literally had to lean out of the balcony to catch any of the sea! the room had a very annoying light right outside which they would not switch off until almost midnight. outdoor showers were nicespa - could not get a bookingrestaurant - pretty good preferred sudamala villas next door"

","paradise in lombok","We stayed at the 2 bedroom Qunang villa for4 nights from 13-17 Oct 14 and it was just amazing. The property was stunning with beautiful timber furniture and art work and a fabulous infinity pool. Generous bedrooms with ensuites including outdoor showers all in lovely natural stone. Large open plan living and dining with comfy day beds to lounge in and enjoy the view and soak in the whole experience. But the best thing about the villa, by far was our own personal butlers(!!!) - Aden and Abdul, who were just fantastic. We just can't say enough about how great they were. Friendly and obliging and treated us like family. And lovely to our 3 year old son. The food was fab - beautiful fresh fruit and juices for breakfast and yummy indonesian curries for dinner all brought to our villa. We highly recommend the villa for a holiday with kids, especially little ones as you have your own space and can enjoy your holiday without worrying about annoying other guests, as the hotel itself seems to be geared more for adults or families with older/teenage kids who are well and truly passed the tantrum stage!! In saying that all the staff at the hotel were lovely and were very understanding when my 3 year old chucked a tanty at the hotel on our last day. The staff were very understanding in what was a distressing and embarrassing situation.All in all a fantastic experience and we would definitely go back!"

","Excellent hotel and location but what about the environmental impact?","Both our daughters have been here on holiday with their respective husbands and we followed their enthusiastic recommendations. The hotel is very stylish - a great combination of local traditional design combined with modern art, western comfort if not to say luxury. It is in a beautiful location, surrounded by wonderfully maintained gardens, with the most helpful, friendly and genuinely caring staff you could imagine. They all work so hard, have very long hours, nothing is too much trouble and always with a smile. A wide selection of food is on offer for breakfast and so wonderful to sit close to the beach while eating. We just wish the cups were larger so that we didn't have the ask the waiting staff for constant top ups....Excellent food in the restaurants - however one niggle is the additional 21% for tax and service charges on everything while other places only charge 15.5%. We hope that this is reflected in the staff wages.... Also some prices are in $ while others are in IDR..... a bit irritating. Some prices are rather high. I had hoped to join the daily yoga sessions in the morning but $20 + 21% for an hours session is double what I pay for a 1 1/2 hours class at home in London ....All in all we are enjoying our stay and are glad that we've got another week left of our holiday here.Not quite paradise as some other reviewers describe it but close to it..... Until you go into the water snorkelling and see the devastation of what once must have been a magnificent reef. There are fishes but the damage to the coral is depressing. Corals are extremely sensitive to their environment and are easily damaged by environmental and human factors. One example of this is people stepping on and even just touching corals. Surely, you are here in a position of influence to not only educate the locals but also your guests how easily corals can be damaged and destroyed. Corals take decades to grow and once damaged the whole eco-system of a reef breaks down.We've dived in various locations - e.g.the Red Sea, the Great Barrier Reef and the Seychelles - and in all places where we stayed it was stressed and often drummed into us how fragile and easily damaged the marine environment is. Even brushing against the corals with ones flippers causes irreparable damage.We believe that if these issues here in Lombok are not addressed sooner rather than later, many people will stop visiting because the reasons for coming are no longer there.On our trip to the Gili Islands the other day we were shocked and saddened to see so many people - visitors as well as their local guides - stepping on and touching the corals with a total disregard to the damage they were causing. What will we all leave as our legacy for generations to come? It is our duty to protect and enhance the environment we have inherited from generations before us."

","Very nice honeymoon location","Great rooms & very large beds with outdoor shower/bathroom. The swimming pools (3) are right by the ocean edge. Swim up to the pool edge & look out over the ocean. Spectacular sunsets. The snorkeling is also good straight out front of the hotel. If you don't have flippers or reef booties (low tide) you may need to enter the water via the small sandy area to the right of the hotel where the boats leave from? Out approximately 60-70 meters from the right hand side (looking towards ocean) of the central pool is an isolated rock (coral) covered with sea enenemy & home to many clown fish (Nemo). Coral overall out front of hotel is not great but many fish & a few sea snakes.Gili Islands is much better for water clarity & coral life.South off the hotel is another property that does excellent traditional style satay kebabs with the charcoal still burning/cooking in the served dish (micro bbq). We both had the same delicious dish with two Shiraz for around 42,000 Rp. Just missed fire twirling show one night.Even further South is another beach style cafe/restaurant where we had lunch with a beer for around 12,000 Rp. Live music some nights. Book here for a better rate of day trip to Gili Islands. 70,000 Rp for two people 9 am - 4 pm.Overall Qunci was great for our honeymoon. Just got micro ants in my check through bag so I had to empty all contents spray shake every clothing item & repack (-1 score). Staff are helpful & friendly. Food is a bit overpriced & 21% tax seems very steep for everything."

","Perfect week","What a wonderful week we had! We really have no complaints!The negatives: 1. There is lots and lots of coral in the water so bring water shoes; swimming is not great. 2. The surfing is nearly nonexistent with a new moon and no swell. That might change with the ocean, the season and the weather!3. Twice a week the resort sprays for bugs so it ""chemically"" for an hour or so...4. If you sit close to the beach during the day, local vendors want to chat.Everything else is perfect!No bugs!Beautiful facilities.Fabulous happy hour!Nice service with very happy, pleasant workers.Very affordable spa services for a resort of this calibre.AMAZING breakfast.Good menus with lots of vegetarian options.Clean, comfortable, attractive rooms.We did day trips for diving in the Gilis... Qunci was a perfect home base.It was a fabulous week!"

","An island getaway, now found","I didn't have the greatest ferry ride getting to Lombok, but once we arrived at our hotel, I was in Paradise. It was exactly what I wanted for my island getaway. I loved the privacy of having our own hut for a hotel room. The restaurants were delicious (they accommodated my vegan diet after playing with the menu a little) and the grounds manicured perfectly. I tried hard in not spending every waking minute at the spa. At the spa, the prices, the experience, the professionalism, the tranquility were all in harmony with our surroundings. My one complaint (which may be out of their control) is how they notify the guests of the bug spraying. I felt like I was suffocating. I had to evacuate to the beaches. No matter what they say, bug spray is harmful. True, I understand its a necessity in Lombok and I do feel safer with it, but the amount I need to breath into my lungs should be minimal. I think they should notify the the guests better. Other then that, I didn't want to leave. I wanted to enjoy their bars happy hour everyday in front of that gorgeous ocean while eating the delicious coconut curry dish."

","Fantastic Honeymoon location","We stayed here for a week at the beginning of October 2013 for our honeymoon. I could not be happier with our choice to make the trip to Lombok and stay here. It was an excellent treat for a special occasion and we had perfect weather. We took a ferry across to Lombok and flew back to Bali for the return. Both ways seemed fine - I would't suggest one over the other.We stayed in a 1 bedroom with pool - Quntum suite. It was located closest to the road and farthest from the beach and restaurants (which is to say it was a 1 minute walk). We liked being away from the main area. The pool was very private. We were able to hear our neighbours on the other side of the wall jump into their pool but no voices carried. The courtyard around our pool was also mostly private except for the entrance to the suite. I don't recall hearing any noise from the road.The food was great. We especially loved the breakfast (included) which you can go down to the restaurant for or have it delivered to your room. If they still have it - order the Big Daddy Croissantwhich! We had a few issues with service while dining ... requested beach front table which there front line servers couldn't figure out, not wanting to give us the happy hour menu even though there was still 30 minutes left in happy hour time, wrong juice delivered, etc. (language barrier?) However, this place is so beautiful and relaxing this did not matter. The food is priced to western standards so you can save money by going to eat elsewhere. We went to one of the places next door for Mie Goreng one night but other than that, we couldn't be bothered to go into town so just at at the on site restaurants.We chose to go to Gili Air one day to snorkel and just took a taxi to the ferries and took the public ferry across. This was confusing and took some time ... and we got soaked as the water was rough. However, we saved a tonne of money by not booking a private tour. The snorkelling was incredible but busy. Nice to get away for a day and do a bit of exploring. This place was worth the flight from Canada and we hope to return one day!"

","A piece of paradise","Qunci Villa is the ultimate in relaxation, this is a boutique resort with 5 star service. Three fantastic restaurants, butler pool side service, everything you ask for is delivered without a long wait. Tonight we ventured off to Sengiggi and had a pizza, on our return to Qunci we stopped by Nooq Thai bar, Esty our waitress served us ice cold Rose and when I said we had dined out but I was still hungry and had a craving for corn on the cob within 5 mins I had it on a plate, not on their menu but delivered with no fuss. Nothing is too much trouble for the beautiful friendly staff here, they go above and beyond to make you comfortable and happy. I absolutely recommend the Coconut water lime leaf vodka martini, it's a must try! We will be back for sure, thank you all the wonderful staff at Qunci for making our holiday special"

","Simply amazing!!","We stayed in Qenanga a 1 bedroom pool villa for two nights for our honeymoon. We have stayed in a lot of resorts and this was by far one of the best we have stayed in. Our villa was a great size, the pool was huge (8x3m) and had sun most of the day. The room was big and well set out, we did have a bit of noise from the road but it wasnât anything to complain about. We had a nice deck area around the pool, with a covered area outside of the bedroom with a table and lounge, which was great for early/late night drinks. We loved everything about Qunci Villaâs, from the service we received which was faultless, to the food and drinks which were amazing. Generally we donât often eat a lot at the place weâre staying, but thereâs really no reason to eat elsewhere here. The ingredients used in both food and drinks were so fresh, well prepared and with an emphasis on using only natural ingredients, made such a difference. Everything we had was delicious, from breakfast (which was chosen from a menu rather than a buffet which I much prefer) to lunch and dinner. The cocktails were also fantastic, so fresh and great flavour combinations, and we definitely made the most of happy hour!! Quite an extensive list to choose from all round with the food and beverages and the prices were more than reasonable.. We also booked into one of their special âelegant dinnersâ on the beach on the Saturday night which had a set menu, again no surprises, food was brilliant. There were three infinity pools right on the beach to choose from, one being a child-free one, and another being smoke-free, which is a great idea. The beach however was rather rocky, youâd definitely need to wear some protective wet suit type shoes to venture out there. We booked an airport transfer through the Qunci (you could easily take a taxi which are parked out the front most of the time), the price was extremely reasonable, so Iâd recommend for ease to just book direct through them for the 1 hour plus drive.It was also my husbandâs birthday the night we arrived (we didnât mention it at all) and they arranged a cake for him which was so lovely and also very delicious. Its touches like these that make the difference in coming back. I really canât speak more highly of Qunci Villaâs and I wish we couldâve stayed longer, I will be recommending this place to my friends and I definitely canât wait to get back there - just amazing."

","Near perfection","We stayed here last year in a beach front room. This year we stayed upstairs in a garden room.I loved the privacy in this room. Once again attention to detail in the rooms and grounds are superb. We could hear the Muslim prayers from our room but it certainly didn't worry us.One pool was a non- smoking pool this time. There is also an adults only pool and then the no restrictions pool. Loved doing daily laps. Breakfasts are good and sitting at a table overlooking the sea in the morning is just superb. The spa has great treatments for reasonable prices for a resort.The massage ladies on the beach do a great massage. The staff are just wonderful. The beds aresuper comfy. Last year we found the food in both Quali and Quah to be superb 5 star this year I would say 4 star. Stodgy noodles and tough beef rendang were a disappointment . Once again we had an amazing stay."

","Stunning location, great service, a real ""get away from it all"" break","We have just left Qunci Villas, having stayed for 5 nights as a family of 3, with our 12 year old daughter.The location is just over an hour from Lombok Airport, which we knew when booking and had arranged for the hotel to pick us up, which is well worth it for the comfortable car, cold towels, water and ipad for the journey. Our thanks to the driver, who patiently endured the 2 hour wait caused by our delayed flight.Check in was easy; the ocean view room comfortable (loved the views and outdoor shower); restaurants all served tasty meals and would make special requests for the fussy vegetarians amongst us! Happy hour overlooking sunset was amazing (except I now need to pick which photos to keep from the 100s taken!). Very little happening around the hotel, which suited us well. An easy taxi ride into Sengiggi for less than 20k IDR takes you to the heart of the ""action"", where you can easily book trips, have a few beers or pick up some essentials from a supermarket - and that's about the limit of the ""action"" - again, this suited us well but may be disappointing for those looking for a livelier holiday. Guest services can also help with booking trips, if you ask - although they don't widely advertise this. We booked a private speedboat trip to the Gilis, which went as planned and did not seem unreasonably expensive at 3m IDR (c Â£150) for a full day's private hire, although I am sure we could have done this cheaper ourselves, if we could have been bothered with the hassle! Equally, you can take a local catamaran (wooden shell with pool noodles either side) across, straight from the beach right in front of the hotel for way less - personally, I was frightened by the size and noise of the crashing waves in or speedboat on the way back and genuinely don't think I could have coped with this in a more traditional one, but maybe that's just me!There are ""hawkers"" on the beach; they are all friendly and pleasant and just trying to make a living for themselves - don't be rude and, if you like something, be prepared to barter and you will get a bargain. We are most days in the hotel, breakfast was included and very tasty (I liked the fact it was a la carte, rather than buffet style - less waste, fresher food); French fries and pumpkin/coconut salad at lunch was fab; and evening meals good too, as I said earlier.Minibar in room is chargeable, at reasonable prices. Kettle with tea there too (ask restaurant for small jug fresh milk if you need it). Hairdryer, shampoo, conditioner, robes, mosquito coil, all in room too and they spray your room nightly.Beach is beautiful, but very rocky - if you have surf shoes, wear them. 3 pools, loads of sunloungers, just fab.Not much more I can add, it's great, go see for yourself!"

","Paradise in Lombok","We loved our stay at Qunci. We spent the first night in a partial-sea-view room, which was very comfortable (and a bit like living in a tree house), then we moved to a one-bed pool villa, which was fantastic. We recently paid nearly $1000 for one night in something quite similar to this pool villa (although admittedly it was a bit more opulent), at Bali's Chedi Club in Ubud, which really shows what great value you can get in Lombok.Most of the food we ate was great and the restaurants have plenty of alternatives, plus there are individual theme nights to mix it up, for those guests who stay longer (we only had 3 nights).What stood out the most was the location - it's right on a lovely beach, where you can swim or snorkel is clear, turquoise water beyond the reef - and the staff. The Lombok people are amazing - so friendly and helpful and keen to please. Everyone was great, but two stood out as exceptional - Samsul, who drove us to the airport (a very bright, amiable but humble guy with some wonderful, honest stories), and Nova, who couldn't do enough to make our stay enjoyable. Thanks to you guys and to everyone else for a lovely three days. With so many great resorts to try in this region, we don't normally go back to the same one twice, but here we would go back to, and we would definitely recommend it to friends (as indeed we had it recommended to us)."

","Great resort and good service","Me and my wife stayed in QV for 4 days and we felt excellent. The rooms are big, the bed huge and each room has it's own balcony with comfortable couch. The restaurant is very good and luckily because in Senggigi I haven't seen any good restaurant that worth a try.Perhaps the one thing to improve is the spa. I find it a little expensive for what it is and they only have massage in it. You could create a least a jacuzzi somewhere in the resort.Overall this resort is definitely worth it. We enjoyed it."

We arrived on our honeymoon and were instantly amazed by how gorgeous the hotel was. Welcomed with drinks and a cold flannel we were taken to our villa room. Everything was so simple. And the bathroom outdoors is to die for. We had a beautiful breakfast every morning outside our villa at exactly the time we requested and then went to lie by the infinity pool for the rest of the day. Happy hour was brilliant with two cocktails costing around Â£5. With the sun setting and the fisherman working in the waves we just sat and enjoyed a majito without a care in the world. No need to leave the hotel as prices are reasonable. Couldn't recommend more. Perfection and luxurious!"

","Location, accommodation, service and food difficult to fault!","With my Australian family we have just spent a week in the 3 bedroom pool villa at this resort.Fabulous ! It is always easy to pick holes, just read the other reviews, but this place is very special.The 3 bedroom villa sits behind the main resort and you have to be transported up and down the hill by car. This could be irritating but when you walk into the villa it is worth it. The place is stunning, as are the views and while you have a quick swim in the spectacular infinity pool your butler will make you a cup of tea and your resturant reservation.The villa is full of an eclectic mix of local, I think, art in all it's forms. Slightly worrying with children but it all survived us.Having a candlelit dinner at the villa was a highlight of the trip for us.We used the main resort for food. It has the best restaurants in Sengiggi. The resort is immaculate and the staff incredible. The other wonderful thing to mention is the prices which are very low.We used the spa and I had my favourite massage, Thai , and it was the second best I have ever had. And she was from Lombok.I have stayed in luxury all over the world but this is now the number one!"

","Impeccable attention to detail!","Wow reading some of the other reviews seems most are happy but some people must live a miserable nit picking existence! I wanted to mention a few things incase you were put off at all- We are really impressed ! Attention to detail like I haven't seen in a long time. From the manicured gardens, peaceful surrounds, crystal clear stone ponds, furniture and structures look new - I haven't seen maintenance like this in Indonesia before. The pool managers give pool boys a nudge to quickly pickup loose leaves and timber work and floors get polished regularly. If I didn't know better if say this hotel is only 1-2years old. Pool- 3 pools across the beachfront - very speccy (and I'm a pool builder) also I see the staff regularly treating the water, no salty pools here. There are a lot of deck chairs so there's always a space - I hate it when at other hotels you can't get a chair near the pool- not here! As the towels are supplied fresh to each chair- there's no hoarding of spaces. Each day we shifted around and these really nice cushioned huts around too! Service was snappy and friendly and poolside lunches were restaurant quality. Beers are served in iced buckets so a large bintang can happily sit and chill:) cocktails were super! Room - beach view in front of main pool- beautiful room - we think best in the place as so easy to swing in and grab what u need or use the loo:) (#56) the bathroom is really cool - would like to take some design ideas home :) Restaurant - tried both - both awesome! We cancelled our dinner in senggigi as walking thru town there was underwhelmed And it's just such good food and beachfront view with dinner. They had some traditional dance which I've seen a million times but this was actually a full local trad music band / dancers and fighters and was perfect to accompany dinner! Spa- massage a delight - half price in the morning was only about $20 aus - and the massage rooms and quality is 5star. Yoga (my wife made me try) was really good before breakfast.. I've never liked being a captive in a hotel and we would always not want to just sit around or be stuck eating in- this is the first hotel where we have looked around town then preferred to come back to eat and drink and lay by the pool as it's an oasis..So close for a relax after gili t - and I personally would book your day snorkel tour via a quick 20min drive to the port closer to gili rather than boat from the hotel as its windy here like perth and boating this side is open ocean not protected like the islands - pay the extra for a private boat tour (so you can move at your leisure) we did this from gili t and it was only $100 Aussie for 10am- 4pm - don't come to lombok without snorkeling the 3 gili island tour - it's amazing (and we aren't mad snorkel/divers) Our trip a perfect few days gili t and then at Quncy villas! Perfect change from our usual Bali trip:) happy as I write this from the poolside hut:) Happy travels!"

The foods at all 3 in house restaurants are excellent. Beautiful beaches with astonishing day and night view. The room were quite comfortable and nice too though they could've provided TV and a cupboard. From our pickup to return, everything went smooth and flawless.

","2nd time round and it's still pretty perfect","My fiance and I stayed at Qunci Villas for the 2nd time round, and we returned because it gave us what we wanted - absolute relaxation for the 5 nights that we were there! The sunsets are also pretty amazing.We love everything about the resort, the food and drinks are of the highest quality, although a little pricey for Indonesia but everything was delicious! Not to mention the daily happy hour (1-1 drinks from 5-7pm). I especially love the breakfast with the view! You can choose to sit a the stone benches right in front of the beach and you can choose from a variety of different types of breakfast everyday. As per my previous visit, my favourite was the eggs benedict. Service from the staff was great and they were always very friendly and attentive. I cut myself while snorkelling (coral was pretty sharp) and they gave me something to clean the wound as well as a band-aid for it. Spa was good, but we could also get a traditional massage from some of the touts roaming the beach for less than half the price (the sound of the waves will also lull you to a peaceful nap). But if you prefer a spa/massage in a more sanitised and relaxing environment, the resort spa is worth a visit!My fiance and I concluded that given a choice, we would definitely choose to return to Qunci Villas again. Lombok itself doesn't have that many activities but Qunci is still our number 1 choice for a relaxing holiday ANYWHERE!"

","i hate to do this, but .....","... the management seems just not sharp enough anymore for this quickly grown property. yes, its a practically nightmare to employ people from the area, but there is no reason to lack in almost all departments of the hotel. Front office leading the poor competence chart here. i hope the owners get encouraged to introspectively look at what they operate and employ a few mystery guest to evaluate first hand.... for us, it was tragically poor managed/trained staff and lots of simple details - common sense based, that would make for a much bigger customer experience , yet we love the place. note: while we checked in there was a walk in sent away whereas i counted several empty rooms available that night and the next morning.... lost income due taking it easy at the front"

So many wonderful staff its hard to name everyone so Marayam, Bianca, Ely, Eka, Arie and all your colleagues, thank you so very much.The property itself is not large but somehow has everything you could need, along with an atmosphere of calm, well organised luxury. All the restaurants are top grade and even though we ventured out to eat, it was always a joy to come back to the menus throughout our two week stay. The themed evenings have excellent menus too, great variety and fun without being forced.Cooking classes a highlight of the stay, thank you Ulan and Frederic for sharing your secrets. The spa is a high standard and beautiful environment so worth the extra dollar, even though you can have a massage on the beach from one of the locals too. Would go back again without hesitation, next time to include a stay over down south too for the different dive sites."

","victims of their success ","so yes the view is breathtaking. but never do you ever have to impression to be alone. The hotel is always super over filled. We were happy to get out of the compound as often as possible because of this, which is very unfortunate.The food however was delicious: a must try is the menu at the adult pool. We enjoyed eating here all the time:) We had a small Vila without pool for ourselves which was very nice, however the service wasn't always top notch (breakfast mix up, not always very clean room). Because the hotel is always overloaded, the service at the pool takes extremely long to bring food or drinks, and foremost doesn't react very quickly to your needs (doesn't take away empty glasses for exemple). The spa was very nice: the Balinese massage is a must! Had it twice:) All in all: if you manage to have a terrific price offer go for it! otherwise I would also consider surrounding hotels which were quieter."

","Excellent, but you pay for it. Same as any upmarket now.","We have been regular annual guests for a number of years. Sorry to say probably we won't be returning as at the rates now charged we are able to have the same special treatment at much easier to reach locations. They are getting high accommodation rates and Mr Scott appears to have decided to rake it in. ( P.S. Room 37 and those around it get late night kitchen noise. )"

","You don't need to leave the hotel","Qunci is totally awesome. I stayed at the Sea View Villa followed by the Single Pool Villa. I didn't know you need to take a car ride to the Pool Villa, although the staff is always on stand-by 24/7. I remembered it was World Cup finals and they sent the car to pick us up and send us to the reception. Went to the bar where they were showing the finals on TV. Food at restaurant is totally delicious and you can eat all meals at the hotel restaurants. Only thing I didn't like was that it is 1.5 hours away from the airport."

","Just what we needed","We has a fantastic time for 5 days at Qunci. Yes, it is as good as the reviews. If you want to totally relax, with no fuss, fantastic food (our fav was the Thai), massage, friendliest staff, local hawkers (who don't come on grounds & are only trying to earn a living and are more entertaining & respectful when you decline than anything else), fantastic view of Agung, great rooms & grounds & feel like you're in a small resort, it's all here. We only left once, for an outing with friends. And guess what, if you have a problem, all you have to do is ask, and they are there ASAP to help. Loved it!!"

","Absolutely Supurb","This was my first trip to Indonesia, we wanted to step up a bit with the type of accomodation we stayed at, and were we surprised with what we got. Quinci was absolutely fantastic in every sense. Only a small group of villa's to keep it nice and peaceful. Great food within and really close to many of the restaurants nearby. Sitting by the majestic pool all day was fantastic. The hotel organised day trips to the south of Lombok to the lovely be as ches there, watch out for the buffalo roaming around.would definately revisit this oneDave R"

","Excellent food","My review for this place will only about their food as I didn't stay here. I went here to attend my friend's wedding. The ceremony was held in the pool area near the beach and it was beautiful. The reception was held at their private villa so we need to take the shuttle that they provided. The food was superb! It was very tasty. It was indonesian food. There were seafood satay, chicken satay, fried rice (if I'm not mistaken, because the color was green with some leaves, and it was delicious), and many more.I had a chance to take a peak into the bed room, bathroom, and living room. It was very spacious with nice scenery. The decoration was unique. I am sure that this place is good for stay."

","Beautiful & Peaceful","Our first visit to Lombok and stayed at Qunci Villas for 3 nights. This property is right on the beach and is stunning. We had an Ocean front room with lovely views and at night could hear the waves crashing - serene. After exploring Sengiggi I would have to say this is the best accommodation by far.I do have a few suggestions that would add to the experience. Evening room service is restricted to a select menu from one of the bars (allergy to seafood ruled this out)We arrived late and were looking for a meal eg: club sandwich/ pasta/burger. These options were not available. A greater selection would be desirable. Background music during food service would be a nice touch for ambience. I would also suggest having bottle openers available in the rooms. We rang for a bucket of ice and bottle opener. When brought to the room the staff member opened the first bottle we had and said they had to take the opener with him as it was needed in the bar! Tea available in the room but no coffee!Lombok - 3 nights was enough. Very quite, little shopping, many derelict buildings. The beach was lovely though."

","Lovely hotel","We really enjoy the stay. However, there are 2 things that we didn't like. 1st, thr room was nice but it was facing a walkway to the pool area. Thus, if we open our curtain, everyone passing by can see right through to our beds. So we had to close all curtains when we want to take a nap during the day. 2nd, most of the foods were wayyy too salty. Other than these 2 downfall, the stay was great! Love the pool area and day beds!"

","Wonderful stay","The service overall was fantastic, and the hotel itself has picturesque grounds, with three pools to swim in and is directly on the beach. The only downside to this is the beach is public and therefore multiple peddlers hand around the edge and harass the customers to buy their goods. The room (we took partial ocean view) was spacious, clean and with a great balcony. One gripe was someone came by to pick up our breakfast dishes despite us putting a 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door. Other than that, in the morning, the noise from the nearby school can be heard quite loudly, so if you are a light sleeper this may be an issue. Apart from that, the spa was relaxing, and overall experience was relaxing and great value. Recommended for a quick relaxing getaway, particularly for the service."

","Very impressed, would happily come back","Was in town for a friend's wedding in September 2013 (but could only select October 2013 in the dropdown menu) and my girlfriend usually books accommodation (& does it well) so I left this in her capable hands. Despite the longish drive from the airport, what was to follow in Lombok was probably the best resort stay I've ever had. What also helped was the beautiful weather too.The pros:- Airport pickup was punctual, no hiccups- The clean, spacious villa - we could fit 3 in the 1 room villa- The friendliness and efficiency of the staff- The outdoor bathroom and toilet - good for drying off wet towels and swimsuits- Delicious variety of breakfast (from pancakes to eggs, fresh fruit), lunch was a bit salty though (but still good)- Choice of eating in the restaurant or on the couch in front of the beach- Proximity to the beach- Relaxing environment, it was nice to see the grounds being maintained- Family friendlyThe cons:- Insects in the bathroom however we were made aware of the outdoor bathroom so we weren't surprised- Distance from other restaurants means you have to charter a taxi to go out- From memory, no buffet breakfast though the selection is still greatI can definitely see why this place would be #1 in the area, 1000+ ""excellent"" reviewers can't go wrong so it was very surprising to see the 7 ""terrible"" reviews. Also pleasantly surprised to see the owner replying to reviewers, keep up the good work!"

","...again, a great stay !","we just arrived back home and we still miss the Qunci Villas. Such a cozy place to be in Lombok ! The resort is located on a beautiful sandy beach, we recommend a Diner in the evening on the beach...... just fantastic ! The rooms are large, cozy and very clean. We loved to sit on the terrace, drinking a glass ofour favorite wine and just watch the sky and the beautiful green of the resort. The staff is almost very friendly and helpful, they serve you lunch on the beautiful infinity pools and the fantastic cocktails to the Happy Hour - we prefere ""Illusion"", a very delicious, very green cocktail ! Of course, every day they also serve Ice-Water and Fruits - always with a smile on the face and we have had some very funny talks and lessons in Bahasa Indonesia :-)We stayed there for 3 weeks, after two I had some problems with my back and so I went to the Spa and after 3 Balinese massages I felt so good like never before ! It still works !!!This was our 3rd stay in the Qunci and we promise this will be not the last - looking forward to see them all again in 2015 !"

","Awesome in every way.","Qunci really was awesome in every way: great location, rooms, gardens, pools, views, sunsets, service, spa, restaurants, bar, beach, cooking classes â everything! We stayed 7 days and I wish we could have stayed even longer. It was a quiet, relaxing and luxurious holiday experience. Everywhere we looked and walked there was a beautiful view or a tranquil design in the building and gardens. And at every opportunity their thoughtful hospitality was punctuated with a yellow or pink frangipani flower, picked from the many flowering trees in the resort.There are three restaurants and all serve great food. Our clear favourite was Nooq, the very small Thai restaurant that operates out of the pool side bar in the evenings. Breakfast is al a carte, and there is a good range of options - my favourites were the nasi goreng and the omelette. All breakfast starts with a fruit platter, which is a nice touch every morning. Our only disappointment with the food was attending a restaurant 'theme night' dinner which was a hawker food set up in the gardens â all of the food was bland. So, we avoided the other theme nights and stuck to the Nooq and the other two restaurants.Service was great. Every staff member we came across was friendly and helpful and polite and patient, and often showing a great sense of humour. They were always accommodating. I took a Thai cooking class (it was one on one in the restaurant kitchen) and the chef, Is, made sure we had enough time to make an extra dish that I said I had enjoyed at Nooq. I'd highly recommend the cooking class â it was brilliant, with some great recipes and tips, and there is a feast for lunch afterwards!The pools are lovely and although the resort was booked out during our stay, it only seemed half full on most days - there were always plenty of lounge chairs. The resort is very quiet - definitely not a place for partying with a group of friends and there were not many young families around. Poolside service for drinks and food was great, and we often had a few drinks at happy hour, watching the gorgeous sunset before dinner.The beach at the end/back of the resort is great for swimming and snorkelling. You can hire snorkels - we spent an hour swimming around seeing a good variety of fish and coral. We also did a day trip to the Gili Islands snorkelling and scuba diving withLombok Dive, they were great (they're in town).The spa was great too! We had massages, pedicure, manicure, and the jet lag recovery treatment - all were lovely. Some of the activities or features of the resort weren't advertised well - we stumbled across the information about the Thai and Balinese cooking classes a few days into our stay, and found out about the restaurant/poolside snack menu (Qunci Bites) on our last day there. It would be very helpful if information about all the activities available at the resort and all the restaurant menus were provided in the Guest Information Book in the rooms.Our room was lovely, spacious, clean, with a great view and a very comfortable king size bed. The bathroom had an open shower, which was novel and enjoyable. Our room was always cleaned perfectly, our bathroom wasn't â I think that was the only disappointment about the service during our stay. Otherwise, the staff made our stay easy and comfortable. We were able to obtain local money from the front desk, they arranged transport for us, and were helpful with some local recommendations, and always willing to go the extra mile to ensure we were taken care of well.We hope to return soon!"

","Incredible & above expectations!","Fully booked resort but so tranquil and not at all crowded. Staff are amazing, with pool side service for drinks, food etc. grounds and rooms impeccably tidy & clean. Turn down service of a night was a nice surprise, as well as 12pm late checkout. (Staff will also allow you to shower in another room after checkout if you have a late flight out!!) Seriously comfy bed. Food and cocktail list to die for.... Not to mention the amazing views. Only a couple of hawkers on the beach but they don't say a lot. Spa staff give incredible massages also! Would definitely be back.Front desk not as helpful as I'd hoped for help with organising a day trip to Gili's but a taxi ride into Senggigi as well as some bargaining soon sorted that out. They do try to go the extra mile. Would recommend a stay to anyone who asks!"

","Just stay here!!!","Well, we needed a week's R n R and that's what we got here! No sense of being hurried or harrassed, just left alone to relax. We will definitely return, we just loved it and it's the only place I have felt a tear welling on departure, even after seven nights!We loved the staff and made a friend ""Vikal, our rock star"" who was our personal favourite but all go out of their way to be friendly, polite and helpful at all times. They enjoyed chatting to us as we did to them. The hotel has done a great job with its employees and employs so many young locals. Great stuff!We loved our room (No. 70) although we could hear the chatter from the kitchen but it was not an issue and the view was just great, for a ""partial sea view"". And, I think we slept in the most comfortable bed ever, so comfortable I wanted to take it home!!Loved dining next to the beach so close to the spotlit ocean, just awesome.Food was great and very reasonable although a few of the main restaurant chairs were not very comfy (sorry).BIG PLUS... they serve Australian wine (wahooooooo!) at a fairly reasonable price too.Loved the outdoor shower, once we got used to the idea no-one was looking (unless they had climbed the palm trees, that is!) which was lovely to look up at the stars and night sky whilst Minor negative: More information provided within rooms regarding facilities, functions, travel as nothing provided apart from the Spa menu and the restaurant special activities. The travel desk area seems to be out of the way and reception seems to be too busy for its size. Again, not a complaint just an observation.Qunci Villas does seem oriented towards the French with a few German and Italians too and as Aussies, we were the minority. All guests were quiet, refined and relaxed and we all seemed to enjoy staying in and around the hotel during the day and to eat at night, which is a great sign.Finally, we really didn't enjoy the Mosques' chanting at dawn but that's not the hotel's fault, just part of life on Lombok. Just be prepared for the early morning chanting!"

","Great Value For Money","Qunci Villas is a beautifully presented & maintained property located right on a nice beach with fantastic views. Ideal for both families and couples with nice restaurants and day spa as well as yoga. The pool three pools stretch the width of the property with ample deck chairs looking overlooking the beach. A very peaceful resort just out of Senggigi which is a world away from the hustle & bustle of Bali. There are a few nice resorts along this private cove that you can walk along the beach to, so you have several dining options as well as Qunci. Overall a really nice resort that is ideal for those wanting clean, friendly & relaxing."

","Amazing place to relax","We stayed at Qunci Villas after our Tour to Mount Rinjani and really enjoyed our stay at Qunci Villas afterwards. The hotel offers a wonderful environment to relax. There are three pools and you always get a nice place directly in front of the pool. Pools and beach are amazing. We also were really satisfied with the service - really friendly and courteous.Breakfast and Dinner always tasted great. Breakfast is included, there is always a fruit platter, a fruit juice and you can choose one breakfast option out of a large menu. Price for dinner are on western level, however it tastes great and is definetely worth its money. We can also recommend the special dinner events - we have chosen a romantic dinner directly on the beach. We also loved our room with partial sea-view on the upper level. Rooms are really big and comfortable. The open-air shower is definitely a highlight. We can therefore fully recommend spending your holidays at Qunci Villas and want to thank the Qunci Villas team for this wonderful stay."

","Great holiday","Our small family stayed at Qunci during our Idul Fitri holiday. Since the hotel was fully booked, we had to move everyday from 1 room to the others. At first, when I was informed about this condition I didn't want to take it, i was thinking about staying somewhere else so at least i can stay in 1 room for the whole period of stay.But, I take a risk to stay in 3 different rooms for our 3 nights holiday at Qunci villas. And it's all worth it. All rooms were nice, clean and comfortable. Size wise is also great. Enough space for all of us. The room and hotel decoration are great. However I must be extra careful with my 14mos baby boy as there are many lamps and statues in the room. And the staffs were very helpful.We loved the food, enjoyed our breakfast overlooking the beach, lunch and dinner. It can be served anywhere. So lovely.Just one suggestion : Please serve the baby/ kids food first. Overall, it's a great holiday. Cant wait to come back again soon."

They nailed the service - real excellent and efficient. The staff were genuine in offering their assistance at all hours, not forgetting that they were very prompt in delivering as well!The other thing that hit bulls-eye for us was the food. They have 2 restaurants and a bar - all 3 serve food and everything that we ordered for every meal was delicious. Everything was finished to very last morsel. Even our lunches that we had by the pool we devoured. Mealtimes were something we looked forward to.The spa there was so relaxing, we paid a total of 3 visits including a facial on the last day. On our first night there, my ankle (old injury) gave way and I rolled down a few concrete steps on the way to the spa, the staff were very attentive and even helped me clean my wounds, provided me with some plasters and a bottle of iodine. They even offered to bring me to see a doctor the next day. Like I said, service was GREAT.The only thing we weren't too comfortable with was the room itself ... The bed was soft and sunken in the middle and we woke up with back aches every morning. 2 pillows were provided but one was too hard and one was too soft .. if only a blend of it could be met! The outdoor shower was also something we weren't too comfortable with as the lighting was very dim for showering at night. Also, on two nights there were two occasions of a wasp and a big roach in the area. We were hardly in our room as we spent most of our time by the pool and on the deck chairs. The view we had was splendid.Kudos to the service, kitchen and spa staff :)"

","It doesn't get better than this","This hotel is simply paradise. We only stayed three nights and wish we could have stayed longer - but unsurprisingly it was full. We stayed in two different rooms - as this was the only way they could squeeze us in during peak season - so you need to book more than the 2 months in advance which we did. The first room was a partial ocean view. Beautiful with enormous bathroom. The second room was an ocean view - also gorgeous. The food was perfect, the service the best we experienced in Indonesia and everything about the environment: art, spa, tidy gardens made you never want to leave. The hotel also recommended a guide - Farosh for day tours to the waterfalls and we really recommend him too. Don't hesitate to book this place - its worth every penny. If I had to be critical about something - it would be the wifi - bit annoying that you keep having to log in after going off line for a few minutes - but we experienced this in all hotels in Indonesia - so not unique to Qunci. I should also add that Lombok was so much more relaxing than Bali."

","A paradise in Lombok","We had a fabulous stay in a room overlooking the ocean. The infinity pools were lovely. I especially liked the outdoor shower. The gardens and art work tastefully positioned throughout the hotel showcased the local artists. You can choose from the three different restaurants. Breakfast was served on tables overlooking the ocean with fresh fruit, coffee, and a breakfast choice from the menu. We went on a snorkeling trip to the Gili Islands with the boat company next to the hotel. He took us to the very best snorkeling areas in the morning. He dropped us off at Gili Air for lunch before heading back to our hotel. We just loved walking the beach and relaxing before heading off to tour the island of Sumatra."

","The best resort we have ever been to!","We stayed here about 3 weeks ago. When we arrived we almost couldnt believe what we was in front of us. An amazingly designed resort, three stunning infintity pools, all with excellent sea view combined with very well-educated staff, a big variety of foods - all of high quality. We had a partieal sea view room with really lovely design. The bathrooms are simply an experience on its own as you will alway get to take an open air shower underrneath palm trees and a sky fulll of stars. Alltogether, a really great place to relax and let go. Before we came to Qunci, we have been travelling around in Asia. Both, my partner and I have travelled a lot and seen quite an amount of hotels and resorts. But this is just perfect. The best resort we have ever been to. It s a must-see. New York Cit or Singapore are must-sees. So are the qunci villas.The only thing we had to deal with were little ants on the door. We talked to the Check-In Staff though, and they helped us to get rid of them quickly.Thank you to the staff for this outrageous experience!We will come back for sure!Max and Rosalie"

Whatever we tried were excellent.Location:- Serene location, 10 mins from Sengiggi market - An ideal place for couple on a relaxing / honeymoon trip.Activities:- Not much activities around; one can get private boats for Gili Islands (a must visit place)."

","Beautiful Lombok, ok Qunci...","Delayed review from March 2014.The hotel is a nice place and the location itself is fantastic hence I have given it a 4* - a nice place to stay for a short period of time but honestly the service isn't up to scratch. My review contains a lot of details about the problems I had there although, they were rectified at the end of our stay but I think the point of tripadvisor is to say everything so here we go! Having just got engaged back in Ubud, coming to Qunci was a little disappointing at first. Due to lack of availability we had booked 2 nights in a normal room overlooking the beach, and then 3 nights in a one bedroom villa. When we arrived our room was unfortunately not clean, there was a small ant colony in the room and the bed sheets were dirty. We called for house keeping and they arrived 30 minutes later. I am very prone to bites and because I didn't see any repellent in the room asked for some yet it was not given because we were told that mosquito repellent had already been sprayed in the room. The next day the staff actually saw my bites and realised there was an issue so I was given some special oil from the spa and the room was cleaned, removed of flowers and I was given insect repellent which really helped - the issue was it took my bites to swell up for them to realise.A couple of things with regards to dining:First thing is that the staff are so rude at each of the restaurants! We were ignored many a time, told rudely about booking beach tables, there was an issue with large insects at dinner one evening (which I understand as Lombok is tropical but this was to a point where the staff ran out of the restaurant and did not help!), and at breakfast you order your food a la carte essentially - I am vegetarian and one day only half of my order items arrived, when questioned about it the waitress was so rude she got annoyed that I asked her and ran back into the kitchen. When she returned she explained they were out of what I ordered (2 vegetable items)- I completely understand that Lombok is a remote place and sometimes it is hard to source everything but sheer courtesy should tell your guests that we are out of this so please order something else? Considering how expensive Qunci is I found this unacceptable!Street sellers on the beach - it is like walking down a busy market. This honestly made us not walk this beautiful beach, and when we sat by the pool instead, the street sellers shout at you from the beach. Some may think this is harmless, but once you stay there you will understand. I have visited many places with street sellers before but not to this extent, not where your days can be ruined by people hassling you, especially when coming here for a peaceful holiday.There must have been a storm the week before we arrived so a large tree had fallen down, I have to say this tree was removed very quickly, but at the same time new decking was being built. Our first night - this building work was going on till 10pm - utterly ridiculous! Having just come from a 5 star property in Bali - where we were informed of building work when we arrived, this was unacceptable! The noise was horrible at that time of night! A couple of days into our stay I was so dissapointed that we spoke to the manager and things were rectified but the first few days here were just disheartening... you pay so much for a lovely holiday and it is a shame that it takes a complaint to change things. I will say thank you for rectifying the issues where you did - we just didn't have the best start and I genuinely believe this is due to lack of communication. The food at dinner is lovely and the one bedroom villas with the private pools are beautiful. If you can. try the spa treatments.Lombok itself is stunning, take a trip to the quieter Gili islands where you can! We went diving on Gili T & Gili Meno and they are beautiful! If you go into Sengiggi then try Asmara Restaurant & Bar - great food!"

","More than words can say...","This was our first holiday to Lombok but it wonât be our last. Not only for Lombok but I have to stay at Qunci again!Stayed for 2 times in July at Qunci in 2 rooms together with my husband and 2 teenage kids. First time 5 nights, second 3 nights.Rooms: we stayed in 2 oceanview rooms. Rooms were very comfortable, clean and spacious. Both times we had an exceptionnel view from the upstair room, just mindblowing.Pool/surroundings: This hotel is so relaxing and really never felt crowded even when it was fully booked. Okay so sometimes we couldnât find 4 sun loungers next to each other at one pool, but heyâ¦. than there are always 2 other pools and we never had any problems.The architecture of the hotel makes you feel at ease the moment you walk in.The gardens and the pools are also beautifully mantained.Service: we travel a lot so we are used to Asian hospitality but the people at Qunci are the most welcoming I can recall. Everywhere in the hotel staff is smiling and saying hello in a manner it felt sincere.My daughter had some skin irritation and we told a woman at the restaurant. I believe her name was Ayu. She arranged someone else to bring some Lidah Buaya/Aloe vera to us from her garden. We really appreciated this and the next morning the rash was totally gone!During our 2nd stay, I came back from Gili Trwangan with food poisoning. Stayed in bed for 2 days. Staff was genuinely concerned and made me some fresh ginger tea against the sickness.I can go on and on about the people here. Also during reservations Scott and his staff were very helpful and made me want to come before even checking out other hotels on the internet!Just 2 little points for criticism:I donât know why but our 2nd time around we had lots of mosquitos in both rooms. Qunci is doing prevention 2 times a week and they spray your room every night if you want to. We sprayed our rooms by ourselves just to keep our frontdoors shut as much as possible and sprayed ourselves before sleeping. Unfortenately we all 4 got bitten. During our first stay we dindât see any mosquitos at all. Strangeâ¦During reservations I mention this holiday was a special one for us because we just celebrated our 25 Wedding Anniversary. I must admit I was a little disappointed Qunci dindât do anything for this, no card or flowers or something.But as mentioned these are just small things and maybe because of this I will rate Qunci 9,5 instead of a straight 10!Well itâs like my title says: it is hard to describe the Qunci villas hotel. A good hotel/good hospitality is all about the experience so I can only say: go to Qunci and find out yourself!"

","Home Again","So why would a North American who travels the world on business (literally) who is married to an Asian woman, both living in Paris take the time out of his hectic schedule to write a review on a hotel when this is usually done by his better half?Because when I find a jewel that should be recognized, I shout about it!Quincy Villas is a main stay of our annual excursions to Lombok. We love exploring the main and associated islands of this paridise, but after 6 year coming here, no other accommodation makes us more comfortable than Quincy Villas. Yes, I am a fan, and a big part of the reason is the manager Mrs (Ibu) Wiwit. She goes out of her way to provide her guests a fantastic stay.Our last stay was spent in the private hillside villa, 3 bedrooms separated by the open air lounging/dining area adjacent to the 20m infinity pool. Sunset with the volcano of Bali mirrored off the still waters of the pool ....wow! I can't give the private butler or the Ibu Wiwit enough praise, we had a great time with our family, safe secure in such a remarkable setting, I didn't want to leave!"

","great all round","I think this was our 3rd stay at Qunci and we'll keep coming back (already booked in fact for another 8 days, lucky us!). We first started staying at Mangsit long before Qunci was built. The only places to stay almost 20 years ago were Alang Alang where we stayed often (then very good but since let go and no-one cares eh Mr Thomas?) and their Puri Mas neighbour. Qunci sure raises the beach bar but blends in so well with the laid back setting, the ocean breezes and the amazing view of Mt Agung. The only glitch was a group of (fellow) Australians who were the typical loud-mouth, couldn't care, noisy plebs from scumville central (no bias from me!) occupying 4 or 5 rooms nearby. Fortunately they only ruined our second last night."

","Fantastic food","I've been to Quinci Villas twice in two years. The reason we keep coming back (and may return again) is because of the food. Beautiful fusion-y food with great presentation. I love the rendang wrap, the soups, the salads, the juices (great for healthy eaters but unhealthy eaters are also catered for). My kids loved the grilled fish and chips for only $5. I'm fussy about what I feed my kids so it was good to find wholesome fish, not battered, just plain grilled fish with potato wedges and a side of vegetables. One of my children also has some food allergies and the staff were always able to accommodate any special meal requests. The beach is also good for kids (a bit wild for very small children though). There are people on the beach offering services - massage, pedicures and manicures, selling sarongs etc - and one guy rents out boogie boards and surf boards. When he has time he'll also conduct surfing lessons. My son and his newfound friend quickly learnt rudimentary surfing in a day. It was a great beach for learning how to surf. There is also a small reef right out the back of the hotel so it's a good idea to bring snorkels."

","Absolutely Top!","Do they need another raving review? Yes, they deserve it on all aspects of what a hotel could represent. The architecture, the ambiance, the excellent food, the friendly service, you can only love Qunci.Even if this place is fully booked it is relaxed with enough beds around the 3 wonderful pools, just enough seats in the restaurants. We usually refrain from booking villas with a pool but we had no choice this time. No regrets.The apparently french chef cooks Vietnamese better than in Vietnam, Thai better than Thailand, Indonesian, everything. He deserves Michelin Stars....Qunci: don't change anything! We love it, even the prices are fine!"

","MOST RELAXING HOLIDAY EVER!!","All of the praise that Qunci Villas has received on Tripadvisor is well deserved.From the minute you walk through front reception and into the resort you experience an incredible feeling of peace. The design and architecture of the resort, the amazing rooms, meals, drinks, staff,spa,pools and views are probably the best I have experienced anywhere in Asia. If you are in need of relaxing getaway, where you leave feeling so much better than when you arrived, then this is the place to go!!! We loved Qunci and we will be back."

","In one word : paradise ! ","Qunci villa is the most fantastic hotel we've booked in our trip to bali. It is built right on Lombok's beach giving its three pools prime view on the ocean. Our one bedroom villa was clean and spacious, with great design (as the rest of the hotel). The staff is very nice and helpful and the food is good. If you get the chance, you should book a table on the beach for breakfast...a nice way to start the day ! Qunci villa offers many activities : we rented scooters one day and booked a snorkeling trip to the Gilis the next one. We hear the spa is incredible although we didn't get the chance to try. You should definitely try this little piece of paradise !"

","Excellent!","We stayed at Qunci villa with our then 7 month old infant. We opted for a partial seaview room. Initially we were given a ground floor and upon checking in, they graciously submitted our request for an upper floor room.This was the wonderful start to our stay. From the restaurant food to the staff and grounds, everything was beautiful. The room was very spacious and being from New York, we enjoyed the space and especially the outdoor shower. The staff was very helpful and friendly. They carried our cherubic baby while we dine, which was always a win-win situation, as baby gets to play and we get to eat. We are very grateful for their generosity and time.Truly loved the view fo Mt Agung in the morning during breakfast. The breakfast food was great. I love the Eggs Benedict. My husband who is a chef, enjoyed the generous breakfast. Spa was great. Fell asleep during a massage!!! Thats how relaxing the whole vibe is there. Will certainly stay there again."

","The best bang for the buck in Indonesia!","For sure one of the highlights of our honeymoon. This hotel was the best bang for the buck of the whole trip, with an excellent service (nova is awesome), amazing room (I guess our room was the best of the hotel since it was the one with picture on the website) which was even better than the villas imho, excellent restaurants, excellent spa, excellent drinks by the stunning pool, and of course: all of this for a lot less than any hotel in bali (around 165 usd per day for the room). I only wish we stayed more.Obs.: Our room even had a shower with a open roof, in which we could take a shower under the moonlight. Be sure to choose the ocean view room number 23"

","Simply Paradise","We booked to stay at Qunci for ten nights after reading so many good reviews on here.We didn't request an upstairs room but were lucky enough to be given one. We opted for a partial ocean view and were not disappointed. Being upstairs affords you more privacy and far better views.Everything about our stay here was first class from the man who picked us up at Lombok airport and pointed out various places of interest along to the way to the incredible cocktails served by the pool at happy hour.The staff are wonderful. They are a stand out feature of the resort and really made our stay what it was. They are friendly but professional and you get a sense that they genuinely care that you are having a nice time and not just being polite in the hope of a tip at the end. There is absolutely no obligation to tip as service charge is included. One person in particular should get a special mention and his name is Has. He was super friendly and efficient and looked after us really well. A shout out to Has from Mr Dan!The other real point of difference at Qunci compared with other places we've stayed is the food.Qunci have 3 restaurants on site as well as offering weekly beach bbq's and themed evenings. The food is really worth bragging about. Coming from London where we have some of the best places to eat, the food at Qunci would rival some of the fanciest restaurants and is probably less than a quarter of the price. Be sure to try the Indonesian Corn Fritters at Quali as well as the Nasi Goreng from the lunch menu (green rice and prawns). I liked it so much I asked for the recipe which the chef was very happy to provide although I doubt I will ever be able to do it justice.Breakfast is included and the menu is pretty vast plus on days when we went off menu, our requests were always accommodated. The French Toast and Omelettes were our faves.We could go on and on as there so many wonderful things to say about this place. We very much hope to be able to return here in the future and will recommend it to any one who will listen. Thank you Qunci Villas for providing us with such a perfect holiday."

The happy hour is great value and the cocktails are awesome!!! 5-7pm two for one!We travelled here for 6 nights in late July and it was Ramadan at the time, the prayer callings from the temple from 1am for one and a half hours during the night was quite loud... Bring ear plugs! We also had to change room as the air conditioning in our room was like the sound of a steam train... They happily transferred us to another bungalow. Amazing location and people.

","PARADISE! You will not find better than Qunci.","My partner and I have just returned from a 6 night stay in an ocean view Qunci room. It was absolute bliss and we did not want to leave.Things we loved about Qunci:- The room was absolutely gorgeous and had a fantastic view of the ocean. (An ocean view room with an actual ocean view!) We took the advice of other Trip Advisor reviews and requested a second-floor room and it did not disappoint. Also, we did not miss having a TV at all. - The three swimming pools (including one kids-free pool and one smoke-free pool - our favourite) means there is plenty of space for everyone.- Three restaurants - so all tastes are catered for. The meals were very reasonably priced for a luxury resort. The food was just fantastic. We ate every meal at Qunci because we just didn't want to leave.- Massages on the beach or in the spa. We had several treatments in the spa and they were all fantastic. Also very reasonably priced and all therapists were absolutely lovely. I highly recommend the Rinjani Trekking Tonic if you hike Rinjani, or the traditional Lombok massage. - Happy hour cocktails! Innovative and delicious cocktails every day at sunset. The service was a little slow at times, but that only helped to remind us that we were on holiday and to enjoy the relaxing pace.- Lastly, the service was just outstanding. I cannot say it enough! We were blown away by how attentive and considerate ALL the staff were. At every interaction we were greeted with a smile. Special shout-outs go to Husni in the restaurant, who helped us get through a sub-30 minute dinner one night when were were running very late for a spa treatment, post-Rinjani hike. He also remembered our favourite cocktails and helped us with a takeaway sandwich when we left to the airport on the last day.Another shout-out to Has in the restaurant/pool-side, who stockpiled young coconuts for us when the restaurant ran out. He even called us in our room one rainy day to let us know the coconuts had been delivered and that he would bring them to our room. The following day I ordered young coconuts by the pool, only to be told by someone else that they didn't have any left. When Has came on his shift he informed us that he had saved two for us the day before! And to Ajir who was delightful company pool-side and had some great tips and insights into what to do in Lombok.Furthermore, my partner and I organised to do the 2 day/1 night Rinjani trek in the middle of our stay at Qunci. The staff were very accommodating of our arrangement and kept our suitcases secure while we left for Rinjani with a couple of backpacks. They even provided us with a breakfast box for our 5am pick up! It was heaven returning to Qunci after our difficult hike - the familiarity and hospitality were just what we needed to relax again before heading home.I cannot fault Qunci, but one thing that irked me (which happens at most resorts) is the sun lounge-grabbing early in the morning. Many mornings we went down to the pool area at breakfast, only to find most of the front-row sun loungers were already occupied with towels. Most of the time the occupants of these sun loungers didn't actually come to the pool until hours later, which seems a little unfair. It would be good if Qunci had a 'no saving sun loungers' policy, or at least had a 1-2 hour limit on unoccupied sun loungers. Also, Sengiggi is pretty quiet with not a lot of shops or things to see. However, everything you need is at Qunci so there is no reason to leave the resort anyway!Finally, well done to all the staff at Qunci for making it one of the best holidays we've ever been on. We cannot wait to get back there and would recommend it to everyone wanting a relaxing vacation."

","Peace and Class in Lombok","My family with three children have just returned from Qunci. We stayed in the Luxury 2brm Villa, Qunang, up on the hill. Everything about the villas and resort were Ist class. The staff always there and ready with a smile and they professionally providing what ever service we required.Special mention for Ony and Budi our Butlers at Qunang. They were always there to greet us on return from our exploring or just returning from the resort below. Each day we took the 5 min stroll down the hill, through the village past the children and women and the chickens, roosters, goats and past the cows and it certainly gave us the connection to our location. If we needed a car that also was prompt and never a problem.Special mention to the pool staff (especially all the yummy cocktails and bar food) and the ladies and men in the Spa. Thank you so much. Heavenly!Only thing I could say, but it really isn't in reference to Qunci and that is that Senggigi down the road, I s not particularly nice, especially during the day. There are a few decent restaurants for the evening, but nothing of the standard of the restaurants in Qunci. Therefore we did spend most of our time either at the villa, by the pools/restaurants or on Mangsit Beach.Would we stay again? Most definitely and I would think it would be heaven for Honeymooners."

","Loved","We loved Qunci. We stayed for 6 nights with our 3 teenage children. The rooms were spacious, the outdoor bathrooms a great idea, and were serviced beautifully each day. We had partial ocean view rooms. As the resort is small and intimate you feel very close to the beach and pool regardless of your room location. We were situated on the southern side of reception which was further from the mosque and therefore quieter than our friends' rooms on the north side. We could hear the call to prayer but it did not disturb us.The ground level rooms were quite exposed and close to pathways, so I would recommend requesting an upper level room. But all the rooms appear to have the same layout. We traveled with friends which was a bonus, as Lombok is pretty quiet and it was lovely to have company for kids and adultsWe ate at the hotel and a nearby resort called Jeeva Klui. The food was good at both.Breakfast was a highlight sitting on the deck looking straight out to sea (no buffet - a la carte)The surf out the front was ok. Pretty well need a longboard. There is a guy who rents boards just to the left of the resort on the beach.The water was beautifully clean.We went out to the Gili Islands for a day. You can organise boats out the front on the beach. We had 9 people so we organised a larger boat on the beach in Senggigi. It was about 150000Rph per person. Worth the trip. Snorkelling was ok. Surf was ok. Great to wander around Gili T village. We also went to Gili Air, where the beach is soft sand and not coral. Had fun lunch at Scallywags. Water beautiful and warm and clean"

","Just beautiful!","As it said in Lonely Planet, Qunci Villas is a destination in itself.........we loved it so much we went back after only 3 months with the family and loved it as much the second time. Right from the staff at reception who were so welcoming with cold towels to the beautiful rooms (amazing outdoor bathrooms), this hotel really is gorgeous. Not too many rooms, lots of loungers around the three infinite pools, amazing food. Nothing is a problem and the staff are fantastic. I arranged our snorkelling trip with the fab people next door in the local warung (food and beer cheap here).If you can afford it, I recommend it. Senggigi is only a 5minute Blue bird taxi ride away. It only costs 20,000rp, so dont be fooled by the guys at the harbour. Just walk up the lane abit and you can get great bargains.This hotel is one of my favourite hotels in Asia."

Swimming, surfing and snorkelling are all possible in the sea immediately outside the hotel (you have to search for the patch of coral reef, but it is worth it once you find it!), and the hotel is well placed for exploring other areas of Lombok. Can't think of a better place in the world to enjoy the sunset while sipping a cocktail. The food is also excellent - certainly the best we had in Senggigi"

","It has to be a 10","I haven't ever awarded a 10 to any hotel but this time I really have to. The location is stunning, the facilities excellent, the hotel staff fall over backwards to help you, there is a great spa and the food is first class. The sunsets and views from the terrace are fantastic. We had our own small pool as we shared a suite with family. Most importantly for us was that when my wife was ill (nothing to do with the hotel) the staff were fantastic they allowed us to keep our suite, helped book another flight and talked to our next hotel in Bali. Lombok is still relatively unspoilt unlike the south of BALI which is terribly busy and is easily accessible from Bali in a 35 minute flight."

","Fond memories!","I absolutely loved loved my stay at Qunci Villas. Loved the open air and bigggg bathroom, the swimming pools, the pina coladas on happy hour, and the breakfast. Oh yes, the breakfast was absolutely divine.I was especially touched that a couple of staff went out of their way to assist me when I had a not-too-serious emergency. 4 days there was definitely too short. I can't wait to go back again.Please keep up the quality and great service, please."

","Nice ""packaging"" but average rooms and service","The Qunci Villas do have a beautiful ""pacakging"": location, next to the beach, and a beautiful garden / swimming pool areas, very green and peaceful villas.They also have a very good restaurant.However, for the price and rating displayed, the room and service are not met.1. Rooms are quite small with no privacy . Our room was on the garden level, with the veranda open on the alley. As a result you have no privacy unless you keep your curtains closed (which then makes it pointless to have a nice environment)2. Very slow and bad serviceEach time we asked for a service, we had to wait a long time and call back many times to make sure our request was received.Staff is not especially friendly, not making you feel comfortable.I would not go back."

The food is perfect. Our villa and pool are kept beautifully clean, it is good to see the room crew taking so much pride in their work that yesterday after they had finished, they had a last look and went back into the room to adjust one small thing that did not meet their standards.My four hours in the spa yesterday being pampered from top to toe was just amazing,thanks Diana. In all of our holidays I spend time in the spa and this did not disappoint. I have booked another day of pampering just before we go home.Breakfast and dinner overlooking the ocean, sunsets that invite you to just sit and watch, the cocktails help as well.Our first visit to Lombok will not be our last and we could not stay anywhere else.THANK YOU to all the staff"

We were there with our Grandson Connor who was very popular with the staff, who were all extremely friendly and obliging, especially the lovely Suehandy who made sure our beers were cold and the cocktails at happy hour were in good supply. Breakfast was lovely, the food was sensational, we only went out to eat on a few occasions into Sengiggi but found that the restaurants at Qunci were sooo much better. Would definately be back, boohoo that Jetstar arent going to fly into Lombok after October though."

Service was excellent and Qunci Villa was generous to provide a Birthday brownie for my babe. Its also really sweet of the staff to sing the birthday song for her. Wished it was my birthday though. hahaaThe bed is like Candy floss ( Very very comfortable bed ). The pasa malam night was a delight, delicious food with a romantic atmosphere and there's 1 for 1 if you order the drinks at the thai bar. Imagine sipping your cocktail at the beachfront with the ocean waves crushing onto the shore and the moonlight shining*. Simply breathtaking...Aint that swellll. Breakfast was great but selections are limited. Would love to come back again someday. Cheers"

","AMAZING!","Each year we vacate in Bali for an indulgent week away. This year we thought we would try Lombok and thanks to Quinci Villa Resort our Lombok vacation exceeded our expectations. From the moment you enter this boutique style Villa Resort you will be swept away. It begins with the wonderful staff continues with the grounds, quality of the rooms, beachfront location and the Food! Sublime. Having romantic dinners on the beach front deck was divine. Breakfasts and lunch are equally as good with a fabulous choice of food including. And then there is the Spa - treat yourself, it doesnt get much better than this. Can't wait to return. I have heard Jetstar will no longer fly directly to Lombok from Perth as of October 2014. So if you are from Perth consider going soon! A day trip to the Gili Islands was another hi-light of our stay in Lombok with Gili Air being our favourite."

","Epitome of a Resort Vacation","We just spent 7 days at Qunci Villa Partial Sea View room. It was our first time spending our vacation in Lombok. My husband was there to take his Advance Diving course with DSM. I must say, we had a great time, resting and enjoying the sea-front resort. What I liked: Qunci Villa is the epitome of resort living. The scenery is just too beautiful, with Qemboja flowers and natural plants decorating the resort. I loved the fact that everything there starts with the letter Q. Interesting!The staff are always ready to lend a helping hand and very attentive to our needs. They took time to have small chats with us as well as to get to know us better. My active kids aged 7 and 5, enjoyed talking to the staff at Qunci Villa especially the reception staff as well as the staff at the restaurants serving us breakfast. The landscape and pool area are just gorgeous and pleasing to the eyes. While swimming, I can enjoy the vast sea view as well. The sunset at the horizon was just too beautiful. There are some locals selling souvenirs by the beach. I got some things from them for a good price. Remember to bargain to at least half. The sellers are a nice bunch and really harmless. If you do not wish to buy anything, you can just smile and walk away. There are also some locals waiting by the beach who offer a chartered boat trip to the nearby Gili island for snorkelling. We took Pak Badronâs service on our 4th day there and it went well.I especially like the turn down service provided in the evening. The staff will come to spray the room with insecticide as well as make the bed and change the bathroom floor mats. Well done for this service. Our room was clean for the night. I tried the traditional massage as well as hair treatment at the spa. It was relaxing and the spa staff were really professional and well trained. Price was a little pricey but hey, you are on a vacation so, let it go a little. What I can dislike/suggest: Since there are 3 pools in Qunci Villa, one being an all adult pool, perhaps Qunci Villa can have an 'all kids' or 'family' pool. Reason being, my kids were rather noisy with their laughter and splashes and they did disturb some of the adults who were trying to sleep or read. I had to keep reminding my kids to be quiet and that was quite stressful for me. Next time, I might have to book for a 1 room pool villa. We stayed in room 35. The view was very nice. However, since it was near the restaurant, we could get the food smell all the way up when it was lunch or dinner time. There was also a pair of cats that would come to the balcony almost every night. Although we are cat lovers, I didnât like the cat fur that was stuck on the balcony couch. There was also lots of termites eating the wooden fence on the balcony. Maybe you can have that checked out. Overall, Qunci Villas is beautiful and definitely a good place to rest and rejuvenate the mind and body. I would love to come back with my husband for our next wedding anniversary next April. And Scott, I would very much like to meet you on my next trip there."

Very nice pools and enough beds during the whole day, so you don't have that 'reservation culture' around the pool. If you don't have children and you want to have a quiet stay, then you are at the right address. They don't have a pool for children and no facilities for children. This is really a plus if you just want be there as a couple! Everything is made to relax and have a wonderful time. Staff is there to make you feel comfortable all the time. No extra fee for room service. Very nice food for reasonable prices. I hope we can go back one day, because it really was nice to stay in Qunci Villas and in Lombok."

","Perfect","Stayed at this villa for 3 nights at the beginning of June 2014. If you make a trip to Lombok, i would highly recommend you stay here. The villa rooms are lovely with their outdoor baths and showers. The place has 3 outdoor pools so plenty of space and also an adults only pool which is handy. Quinci also has 3 restaurants which we ate at which were all very good, especially the thai restaurant. Happy hour is also offered on cocktails and their cocktail selection is very good indeed. The morning breakfast, delivered to the room if required, was also of a high standard. The best part of the hotel however is the view you get from the deck. The hotel backs onto the beach so you get a lovely view of the sea when relaxing by the pool. The staff are very friendly and helpful. We stayed for 3 nights and didn't actually leave the resort. haha. The spa options were fantastic and the staff were very highly trained. Would love to go again."

","Amazing Hotel, Great Service","We stayed at Quinci Villas for one week whilst on holiday in Lombok in February. The location, just a 5 minute ride from Sengigi, was close enough to be convenient, yet far enough to be secluded and quiet. We opted for the basic garden view villa, and was not disappointed. The rooms are very well proportioned, clean and comfortable. We were initially given Villa 79, which was a ground-floor villa and had our balcony and main door overlooking a main walkway, and anyone walking past could look into our room. We then asked for a more private room, preferably on the second floor, and were relocated the next evening to another villa (Villa 49 or 44 I think) which was on the other side of the compound. The room was exactly the same layout, but with a proper balcony and privacy.The staff were always very attentive and helpful. A special shout out to Rama, who was always cheerful and welcoming, and more than happy to offer us tips on where to go and what to eat.If you fancy indulging, the on-site spa is worth the price.Breakfast is also a feast to behold. The portions are huge and tasty. Our only gripe was that after a few days, the food tends to get repetitive. However, the dinners are something else altogether. There are themed-dinners held throughout the week (we had an outdoor BBQ one evening, and a Valentine's Day romantic dinner another), which are well worth the price."

We enjoyed the range of Western and Eastern food in the restaurants and the ability to sit by the surf by candlelight enjoying the warm evening air.Would have no hesitation in recommending Qunci to anyone who wants a relaxing luxurious holiday in beautifully designed facilities well located in Lombok for trips to the Gili Islands and near by beaches.

","Qunci Villas June 2014","Friends and family arrived home from Lombok yesterday and thoroughly enjoyed the experience, in no small part due to our wonderful accommodation at Qunci Villas.My 2 daughters (11 & 9) and I stayed in a Garden View Room which had ample room for the 3 of us and was very comfortable. My only negative comment would be that our outside bathroom did not look like the one on the Qunci website photos, although it was more than adequate. I was just looking forward to the whole jungle showering experience.Friends stayed in a one bedroom pool villa which had much the same layout as our room, but with a lockable entrance gate which lead to their pool area and villa - very nice!The 3 public pools were inviting in the hot Lombok sun, plenty of sun lounges, and service around the pools was great Many a bintang and chocolate milkshake was had lazing on the sun beds.The food at the 3 restaurants was always delicious, and the staff very attentive. We very much enjoyed having breakfast overlooking the beach.The gardens were immaculate, we took the time to stroll around the entire property and I enjoyed pointing out the art work to the girls.My kids loved the beach in the morning when the tide was in, but it may be a bit too rough for younger children. Later in the day the waves are smaller.I had a reflexology massage at the spa and can honestly say my feet have never felt so pampered, it was wonderful! And the handsome young man who massaged them, well that was an added bonus ;)All in all we had a fantastic time, everyone came away relaxed and happy. The staff made us feel truly welcome, always smiling and just beautiful people. I would highly recommend a stay at this lovely hotel."

","Utmost Tranquility","I am writing this review as I check out from a most relaxing three night stay in lombok. This hotel epitomizes thoughtful and luxurious relaxation. The grounds are well laid out, the villas are very comfortable, the common areas are meticulously well attended to and the pool/bar are perfect spots to lounge in. Daily happy hour is a must, as it is perfectly timed and positioned to allow you to view the famous lombok sunset. Another must do is the spa - we tried the massage, facial, body wrap and pedicure - and every service was professional, clean and just plain good! Tip: if you have time, take a $5 transfer to the gili Islands and spend the day hanging amongst the backpackers. It offers a completely different flavour and has plenty of awesome beachside restaurants, bars and seafood shacks to discover!"

Since airport is not in Mataram anymore the distance is little bit far but doesnt matter Qunci can arrange car for you. The atmosphere in the hotel area is so beautiful and romantic. The afternoon view on Balinese volcano GunungAgung is incredible. Hotel staff is trained well and these who dont know something are trying all their best to make you fell comfortable. Yes, the beach in front of hotel is nothing special but if you walk to the right about 50 meters you will see huge clean and empty beach.They always have problems with foreign credit cards so better take cash with you.

","Perfect resort","We can fully second all the excellent reviews on Qunci below. Even after having stayed for more than a week, it was difficult to leave. The combination of the beautiful location, sea views and hotel grounds, the warm and attentive staff, the serenity, the beautiful room and the excellent food make this a perfect resort.Although the hotel is quite big, it never felt crowded and we were always given personal attention. One of the things we very much enjoyed was that there were sufficient sun loungers available at the pools at any time of the day, no matter what time one arrived. Used towels of guests who had left were replaced by new ones in an instant. We also really enjoyed the food, no matter in which restaurant, and felt that the price-quality ratio was absolutely fine for a hotel of this type (approx. IDR 120,000 for a main dish). We tried a lot of different dishes and almost all of them were excellent. However, the sizes and presentation quite varied - some dishes came in huge size and sophisticated presentations, others were rather small and just put on the plate without much decoration - maybe different chefs? Dessert portions are huge, so after a main, it's usually sufficient to share one dessert. There is an a la carte breakfast with many options, no buffet.During our stay, the guests consisted mainly in couples from Europe, Australia and Singapore. There were some families with children too, however, there is no separate children's pool or playground and the waves at the beach can be quite high (depending on the time of the day), so would not recommend it for families with small children. The hawkers on the beach are nice to talk to, and while of course they are trying to sell you their stuff, they also accept it if you don't and don't get upset. If you plan to buy some souvenirs anyway, you might consider buying something from them during the first few days of your stay, so that you'll have a more quiet stay later on.We stayed in a partial ocean view room at the ground floor which had a balcony and was lovely. I don't think it's worthwhile paying the extra for an ocean view room since the view from the pool area is excellent and that's were we spent most of our time while in the hotel anyway.There was no TV in the room, but I understand that you can ask the front desk to supply you with one if you want. We did not miss it during our stay. The beach is really nice and clean and not busy. You can swim in the sea during the entire day, however, at low tide you have to find your spot to swim as the water is not deep in many places and the waves are high. Probably less suitable for people who are not good swimmers; however, you also have a choice of 3 pools for swimming.The grounds and rooms were sprayed against mosquitoes, and we experienced few of them during our stay.The only small negative remark I'll make is that the wifi was at times extremely slow and kind of erratic."

","THIRD TIME HERE, WILL COME AGAIN!","This was our third trip to Lombok and third stay at Qunci Villas, that alone must say something! Our first visit was nearly 7 years ago when it had just opened and we were captivated, we hoped it would remain our 'little secret', but as the years passed the hotel grew and so did the number happy guests and reviewers. We are pleased to say that after our most recent stay (for 2 weeks just passed) and despite the growth and development, the hotel has remained personal, polished and quiet. The staff are just as attentive and friendly as they always have been, many of whom remember us from previous visits and welcome us ""home"". Everything about the location, layout of the spaces, menus, art, gardens, day spa and personal services has been thought of, I even did some yoga classes there this time!Qunci has always been very cosmopolitan, we especially enjoy meeting other foreign guests, most of whom have travelled from Europe and afar to share this patch of paradise - we understand why they travel more than 15-20 hours to get here and are grateful we are only 7hrs away! Qunci offers the opportunity to be a base for adventure like snorkelling, diving, trekking, surfing or to be an utterly blissful place to do nothing in peace and serenity. This truly is a remarkable place and applaud the owners and management on attention to detail and allowing Qunci to grow without losing the intimacy. We will be back a forth time....."

","Probably best boutique hotel we've stayed in Asia.","I am staying at Qunci as I write this review. Arrived here after beginning our honeymoon in Hong Kong flying from London (yes we are English) not all that common compared to Aussies and Central Europeans at the hotel. What a great place. Negatives on previous previews I will comment on below as I will add my own pros/cons.Pros: amazing setting, amazing pools. Great service, great food (no decaf coffee at breakfast?!) very good lunch menu, club sandwich rates highly and I've had lots from hotels! Inventive menu (Asian food) I try and avoid European menus when in Asia but they need to cater for all tastes and Asian guests also. Good bar, 60k idr for large Bintang, 100k for cocktails or BOGOF between 5-7 (cocktails only) We stayed in two rooms first on ground floor but moved to high floor with sea view (50) more privacy also. A few miles up the coast from centre of town (not a bad thing) next door is a couple of local warungs if you fancy alternative dining and a local shop for snacks and drinks across the road! Hawkers on the beach can get tiresome but only as some don't get the message that you don't want a pink sarong for a man or xxxl singlet when you are already wearing one that fits like a glove :) they do have some good stuff to buy though, sarongs etc. Great local massage on the front left of hotel 120k for 60 mins or a Qunci pro massage within the hotel for $ 30+++Good surf opportunities, potential fishing from beach like the locals do (my rod is in my bag)Some goats and frogs to keep an eye out for, a few cats to keep your feet company under the tables. Good friendly staff!Cons: milk quality is not the best but this is just a personal thing. Warm mayo when ordering an EU lunch option. I think it would be good to have the bar slightly more informal as it is more restaurant than a beach bar which would really give the extra remote beach holiday feel (beer wine spirits aplenty though) Lastly and a personal thing again. I asked for local sambal each evening we are at Qunci 2 of 4 nights and the sambal in my opinion was feared for tourists.. If I ask for hot I expect hot!! The hotel needs to offer crisps and snacks throughout the day as I was over at the local shop buying cassava bags each day (it's good to support locals though)Great place and I would return!!!"

","Wonderful place to stay in Lombok for a much needed R&R","I stayed in the garden room on the ground floor after finishing my trek from Rinjani. The room was spacious and quiet and the facilities were wonderful. With ocean view swimming pools, I really had nothing to complain about. I used various treatments at the spa everyday I was there (3 nights) and they were great. The staff overall were very polite and helpful. I didn't leave the resort because there was no need to. Everything was very comfortable. The only 2 drawbacks were:1. The Thai and local food were great. The Western food was not so great. I think they should check their recipes. The food was not refined and very salty. I ordered the pasta primavera and was disappointed. I never ate at that restaurant again. The carpaccio sauce was so heavy and salty. They need to tone it down. Breakfast was quite extensive and it's great they deliver it to your room. Some choices were better than the rest. Today I tried the Aussie one and the beef bacon was dry and tasted like cardboard. The best is the farmers breakfast. Maybe they should review their choices. The milk was really awful. For this type of resort they should serve fresh milk. It changed the taste of the tea I was having. 2. The outdoor toilet smelt like raw sewer. They should check it out and find out the source of it. I was in room 14. Also the upstairs room patrons were moving around like elephants. Their footsteps were so loud so I guess it is not very sound proof."

","Paradise in Paradise!","My partner and I recently spent a week at Qunci Villas and it was nothing short of bliss. From the moment we got off the plane and were met by our friendly and welcoming Qunci driver to the moment he took us back to the airport a week later, our experience couldn't have been better.The staff are fantastic - unfailingly friendly, attentive and helpful - and happy to arrange whatever your heart desires, from day trips to waterfalls, to boat hire, dinner reservations at your preferred table, and chilled champagne glasses that arrive at your door barely a minute after you've put the phone down from requesting them. The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful, and the architecture fits perfectly with the Lombok surrounds. The interior design is also excellent, and you can tell that every little details - from the gardens, to the art work, coffee cups and shampoo bottles - has been careful chosen to create the Qunci experience. The three restaurants - each with its own cuisine and menu - are each truly excellent and massive kudos must go to the chefs. Also worth experiencing the different nights that the hotel puts on (Indonesian Barbeque, Night Market, Sasak Culture) as the food is excellent and it gives you a real flavour for the island, its culture and its cuisine. The cocktails - particularly those that use sugarcane juice - are to die for, especially when enjoyed on the beach deck watching the sunset over Bali! The only thing that could be improved upon is the somewhat limited wine list (particularly if you prefer old word wines to Australian), but it is a small price to pay for a stay in paradise!The spa is also excellent - we sampled it via one of their wonderfully relaxing traditional Lombok massages - the masseuses were very skilled, the treatment rooms are lovely and create the perfect atmosphere, and the pre- and post-treatment drinks are a really nice touch.Our room was nothing short of heaven. We stayed in one of the one bedroom rooms with a private infinity pool and it was absolutely stunning. Beautifully decorated (with a fabulous piece of art work), the shower exposed to the elements is wonderful, and being able to relax by your own pool in the privacy of your own walled garden is a real treat. That being said, the three main pools are also stunning and not too overcrowded - the adults only pool (strategically located next to the bar) is also a real winner. The hotel is a very calm, relaxing and tranquil place. It is best suited to the more discerning guest. couples looking for a romantic getaway or small, well-trained families will love it here - but definitely not for groups of friends looking for some raucous and boozy fun in the sun. Overall it is an absolutely wonderful place to stay that we can't say enough good things about - and can't wait to get back to next year!"

","Perfect holiday in a beautiful hotel","We have booked 8 nights in Qunci and today will be our last day in Lombok sadly. This is my first time writing a review for any hotel. I am just so impressed with Qunci and it's exceptional service that I feel compeled to write this review. Our check-in was smooth and while filling up the details, we were given a refreshing welcome drink and warm towel. We were given a very nice room with partial ocean view which is centrally located. Room is tastefully decorated and spacious enough and a really awesome outdoor shower! We are very impressed with the entire setting and atmosphere of the hotel. Lots of greenery and plants, gardens are immaculately well maintained. The 3 infinity pools have breathtaking views over the Ocean. On our third day we went on an excursion and so at breakfast I asked the restaurant staff if we could have a pancake take-away for our daughter as a little snack during our excursion. He came back with the complimentary pancake packed nicely in a bamboo box. Wow! Again we were very impressed! We found all the staffs at Qunci very warm and friendly. On some afternoons at the poolside, we were also served complimentary fruits on a skewer. Free iced water served anytime of the day here is a very nice touch. We dined at the Quali restaurant one evening on their Pasar Malam themed buffet dinner and had reserved a beachfront table. It was very romantic especially with the spotlights on the beach. However we did not enjoy the dinner. My husband hardly ate. I must say for a buffet themed dinner, the buffet spread was very limited and the quality of the food was poor. As we did not enjoy the dessert, es campur and a local cake, I asked the waiter if we could have a fresh fruit platter instead. He kindly obliged and came back with a complimentary fruit platter! That kind of saved the evening. We are also surprised that our daughter get to eat for free as other hotels would have certainly charge half price for child buffet. Ayu from Quali is especially friendly to us and tried to make a conversation. I must also mentioned Diana and Rini from the Qamboja Spa for their friendliness and professionalism. The Balinese massage, facial and pedicure was exceptional! I had a most relaxing and rejuvenating spa experience at Qamboja. There are however 2 minor issues which we think can be improved. I had ordered a fresh coconut at the poolside and I was very disappointed it wasn't chilled at all. A warm coconut on a hot day is a no go! I have always had chilled fresh coconut at all other 5 stars resorts or hotels of similiar standard. Another area where you could improve on is the quality of food in your restaurants. On our first evening we had dined in Quali and ordered a Bebek Betutu, grilled mahi-Mai fish and a stir fried mixed vegetables. The portions were small and it wasn't very authentic. We were not impressed at all unfortunately. We had eaten much tastier Indonesian food in Bali. Also for a 5 star hotel like Qunci, a little more attention should be focused on the presentation of the dishes. We would have appreciated it if the dishes came accompanied with some sort of fruit/vegetables carving After 2 disappointed dinners at Qunci we decided to eat out of the restaurants for the rest of our stay which is a shame! We would have loved to dine in your restaurants more often because we love the beachfront setting of your restaurants. We like your a la carte breakfast but again, there is a lack of presentation. All in all we have enjoyed our stay at Qunci and we will certainly come back again in future and we will also be recommending your hotel to all our friends. Thank you Qunci and all your friendly and hard working staffs for making our stay truly memorable!"

","Dream week in a outstanding villa!","Just returned from a dream week in a fantastic 2bedroom villa at Qunci. Yes the villa is away from the main hotel grounds, and you may want to take the car rather than walk in the heat but it's not an issue at all. Your butler will have a car at your door along with arranging your dinner reservation! The villa is breath taking with its lavish two huge bedrooms and out door showers, stunning pool and massive day lounges. Service was outstanding but a special mention for Ony and Ecko our butlers for the entire stay. They came to know what drinks we love, what coffees we want to wake up to and what resturants and day trips we should try. They were both very informative and knowledgable about their culture and their island. Qunci has beautiful hotel grounds and such fantastic staff in all areas of the hotel we were so impressed. Can't wait to return!!! Thank you Ony and thank you Ecko we will see you again soon!Mr Zachary and Miss Kelly!"

","Absolute paradise","Just returned from 3 nights at Qunci Villas and it wasn't long enough. The grounds and pool areas are stunning and the absolute highlight. Gardens are immaculately maintained and beautifully designed and the infinity pools are sublime. I liked how one of the pool decks is non smoking, and it was easy to get food and drink service by the pool. The free iced water is a nice touch.The staff are very friendly and attentive and we liked our garden view room - it was spacious and comfortable. Some of the rooms are not very private (and have floor to ceiling windows with no privacy screens, only curtains which block out all light) and we wouldn't have wanted to be located close to reception or one of the more public walkways - luckily we had one of the more private rooms. We had numerous spa treatments which were very good and reasonably priced. Dinner at the Mediterranean restaurant was very good as was dessert, but we were disappointed in the breakfast and lunch food. Fresh juices are diluted and not very tasty. I liked the a la carte breakfast style but food quality and presentation could be improved (when I only get one plate, I have high expectations; I go out for breakfast almost every weekend in Perth, Qunci's offering was not as good as what I'm used to). Lunch food was excessively oily - we tried both western style and Indonesian dishes and were disappointed.We took a boat trip to the Gilli islands which was nice but it takes about 1.5 hours to get there from the hotel and I felt sea sick because it was quite a small and unstable boat, next time I would drive to the harbour and take a shorter boat trip. A tip: we booked through the hotel reception but they just use the same guys who are selling trips on the beach, so you might as well book direct with the beach sellers and you'll pay substantially less for the same offering.Overall, an excellent stay at this beautiful resort and we'd recommend it and would love to return!"

","Fantastic!","We stayed in a private pool villa and had a difficult time leaving our private paradise-- fantastic! Breakfast was included in our package and you could either eat at the restaurant or have it delivered to your room for free! The food at the hotel was average, but the spa was fantastic and reasonably priced. The grounds are excellent, although the hawkers near the pool can be a bit annoying. The hotel also arranged a driver for us for approximately $10 USD/hour when we wanted to go exploring.You can also make a reservation at the resort restaurant to sit along the beach for a sunset dinner. Again, the food is average, but the view is fantastic. There is no additional cost for the beach side table.To get to Senggigi it is about a 5 minute ride/ approximately a $2 taxi ride"

","Fantastic Hotel and Amazing staff","The moment we arrived at Qunci villas we were blown away by the grounds and the efficiency of the staff. Having stayed at other Lombok hotels before you are always keen to settle in after the long drive and we were checked in and taken to our villa within 10 minutes! We stayed in the 2 bedroom villa which was so beautiful. Although it is across the road and up a hill from away from the hotel grounds we always had a car ready for us whenever we wanted to be taken anywhere. The walk is only 3 minutes but a hot day and the steep hill is not ideal and reception always had a car ready for us when we returned. In the villas you we had 2 butlers, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, who stayed with us the whole 8 days. Ecko and Ony were so fantastic and attentive, we always had a drink in our hand, always had our breakfast ready, the villa was always spotless and whatever day trips we wanted to take were organised by them. Ecko makes the best coffees and fresh juices when you wake up and assisted us with all our trips. He organised a private boat for us to go fishing and snorkelling and we never had to worry about a thing. Ony was with us from the mid afternoon until 11pm and we just adored him, he organised all our dinners, made the best cocktails and taught us all about Lombok and Indonesian history. All the staff are great but Ecko and Ony really made us feel at home! The day spa is reasonably priced and the service was great, get in early though as they do book out a day in advanced in the busier weeks. The restaurants in the hotel are amazing, great food and service. We did a cooking class at the hotel and learnt how to make some traditional Indonesian dishes. The head chef also took us on a tour of the kitchen and I was very impressed, the kitchens were immaculate, the ice cream and breads are made fresh everything and the seafood is still alive in water out the back. If you are choosing a hotel to stay at in Lombok Qunci has it all. Thank you for such a great week and we will be coming againBianca"

","Lovely accomodation and friendly staff","Qunci villas is stunning - from the rooms, to the location to the pools its all perfectly set out. The rooms were large and all well located - the resort runs along the beachfront rather than going back with only a small beachfront space, so you are never more than a few meters from the pools and beach. The staff and friendly and helpful, and work hard to ensure that service is of a high standard. I had a lovely massage by one of the local women at the front of the resort (US $10), as well as a spa treatment which was amazing (US$75 for 2 hours).The cocktails were delicious, although on the pricier side - av US $12 - we stuck to drinking them them during the 5pm-7pm happy hours. The food was tasty - but nothing amazing - and also on the pricier side. The mahi mahi I ate the first night was overcooked and the gado gado was okay but not as nice as some of the other gado gado I ate while on the holiday. The tapas were good - particularly the edamame - ad I had a really nice local raw vegetable salad with a peanut sauce that was delicious. We ate dinner at Jeeva Klui one night and there food we thought was of a higher standard. That said, unless you are extremely fussy, you're unlikely to be too dissapointed here. The included breakfast options are great with something to please everyone."

","Good Experience","The hotel is certainly a jewel in Lombok where the ordinary life is not too far away from that peaceful place. If you want to go for a swim in the open sea, you should wait for high tide. Otherwise too much pain for your unexperienced feet because of too many stones on the lower beach side."

","Excellent stay at Qunci","Stayed at the ocean view villa for 3 days 2 nights, overall very exceptional experience! Stayed in November, so hotel was not really crowded, which adds to the plus point. Both Quah and Quali restaurant have nice atmosphere although food was a so-so. Qamboja Spa is a must try! Especially loving the couple package. All in all, a very memorable stay. Would love to have buffet breakfast though! :)"

","Qusia villa is Unbelieveable","Qunci villas was an incredible place to stay, from the moment we got there, we were treated in a first class manner. We were a party of 3 couples from the US, and stayed at Qusia, the private luxury 3 bed master villa, which was unreal. As if the private infinity pool overlooking the field of palm trees with an ocean backdrop and Bali just in front of the sunset wasn't enough, the service was great. A special shout out to Andi and Aden, our two butlers who cooked all our private meals and made sure we had everything we needed. As well as setting up massages and our drivers - they were there when we needed but allowed us to relax on the villa's incredible grounds at the same time. The bedrooms, study, gym, and sitting rooms were awesome too, all with incredible views. The pictures don't even do it justice.The regular hotel grounds were great too, with multiple infinity pools, happy hours, and a great spa. 10 min from Sengiggi and 20 min from Teluk Kode for fastboat, maybe rent some motor bikes too! Good little surf spot in front of Qunci, look out for the reef at the point Alang Alang ;)Also, ask around for Bahram, a super nice local guy who provided us with boat transportation to the Gili isles for a great surf/snorkeling and lunch day trip, amazing!"

","Truly Unique Experience","We booked the 2 bedroom villa on the hill for a 3 night stay. It was absolutely beautiful! I am not accustomed to such stellar service! We had 2 butlers who alternated shifts 7AM-11PM and they were very helpful and considerate. I used the spa (Ultimate Experience) one day and other than a miscommunication resulting in my not getting breakfast that day, it was a wonderful experience.I had my doubts when booking if being up the hill and relying on transport down to the main hotel would be an issue and it was an extra step but I think the privacy was worth it. I noticed many hawkers on the beach below the hotel hassling guests if they walked on the beach and wondered why the area wasn't better monitored? Resorts in Mexico and the Caribbean have security on the premises to prevent that from happening.I would also recommend a smoother process for check in for villa guests? We got there after dark and when the front desk clerk realized we were to go to the villa, he jumped out of his seat to get a driver to take us up there. It wasn't immediately clear to us that the process would be handled by our butler at the villa. The roadway up to the villa is partially paved and wonder if there is difficulty with people living alongside that road as to why the road is not fully paved?These things were not major issues and overall we had a wonderful stay!"

","The Best Vacation in 34 Years of Marriage","My husband and I have traveled throughout the world and like to stay in beautiful places that capture the culture and feeling of the place we are visiting. Never before have we stayed in a place more beautiful than Qunci Villas. The design and layout of the hotel is like experiencing an oceanfront paradise. The decor is spacious and serene capturing the feel of the culture, ocean, and amazing surroundings. The people who work at the resort are lovely, kind, and service oriented. For example, we ordered a Bloody Mary from the bar which was made from fresh cherry tomatoes and the bartender came over to make sure that it was prepared to my liking. Every morning you can literally sit in front of the beach (almost literally on the beach) and eat a delicious breakfast while you are watching the waves break right in front of you.We had a second story ocean front room which I highly recommend. The view from the room makes it almost impossible to leave the room. The outdoor shower is quite exotic and the room is beautifully appointed with local art and furniture. In fact, everywhere you look it seems like it is an outdoor art gallery with sculptures and paintings. We loved the architecture so much, and felt that half of the specialness of the resort was due to the magical design of the property.I agree with the other reviewers who stated that they did not want to leave the resort. There are so many unique lounges and sitting areas viewing the ocean and the pools that make you feel restful and happy.We do not hesitate to give Qunci Villas our highest recommendation. We are sad that it is such a long plane trip to get there, as we live in Southern California."

We started in a one bedroom pool villa for a couple of nights and then to a one bedroom luxury villa ""Villa Qumbang"". Both were more than satisfactory but the Villa Qumband was outstanding. Very quiet and private. The food in the hotel was the best food we had during our entire stay in Lombok. Local food was great too but the hotel food was excellent.Highly recommend this hotel."

","Best breakfast ever!","Having your breakfast served on a rustic stone table, overlooking Mount Agung across the island, surrounded with the sound of ocean waves was surely one of the best breakfast I have ever experienced so far. Two-storey villas are scattered around the resort. Our room was located at 2nd floor and it has its own balcony with partial ocean view. The shower area is designed as an open-air space so we can have shower under the bright blue Lombok sky.Qunci Villas' own restaurant named Quali, was serving great asian seafood dishes. Guests can also opt for dining by the beach. The staffs are friendly and helpful. They surely put priority on guests sastisfaction.Maybe next time we should try the Qamboja Spa.#ILoveLombok"

","Most amazing holiday","I booked direct with Qunci and organized transfers as well which we were so glad we did. Its about an hour away from the airport but the drive is pleasant and allows you time to take in the scenery.Qunci is tucked away so not walking distance to shops and restaurants but we knew this before booking. We spent 6 nights here and wished we could have stayed longer. I booked an ocean view room and was so glad I did. The view was amazing and we spent many night sitting on our upstairs balcony and just chillin'. We ate 2 nights at the restaurant and my fav was Quali. We did have lunches at the resort and loved the club sandwiches. I would say the prices are reasonable for the quality of food and drink and we were pleasantly surprised by out bill on check out. Breakfast choices are extensive and very ample. We had planned to do some day trips but loved the resort so much we pretty much stayed in the whole time. The 3 pools are amazing but my fav was the adults pool right next to the bar :)The whole resort is so beautifully maintained and this is a credit to the hardworking staff. All the staff we dealt with were so courteous and friendly without being over the top. We would like to mention some that stood out for us..Jamie, Aziz, Febry and Luhur. Thanks so much for making our trip memorable. We will definitely be back!!"

","Brilliant place to unwind and forget about the world","I went there with 3 other couples. And it was a wonderful experience. Check in was efficient (note: to expedite the process, do have your booking printed as opposed to having it as a pdf stored on your mobile devices), staff were gracious and attentive, and the ambience was lovely. We were certainly off to a good start.As we arrived late in the evening, we didn't have the chance to explore much of the resort. But when we did bright and bushy-tailed the next morning, we were pleasantly surprised how big the compound was. There were a number of pools, and one that was strictly for adults. Well situated next to the bar but of course. Brilliant!And what better way to fuel up then to head to the restaurant for a spot of breakfast. If you prefer, you could have a couple seat right at the water's edge for an unobstructed view of the sea. Otherwise there's plenty of seats available indoors. For breakfast, you have a choice of either Indonesian or International. You could even go for the organic one if you are feeling a tad guilty from too much revelry the night before. While it isn't buffet-style, you can order pretty much what your heart, and stomach, desire. Regardless what you choose, you won't be disappointed. The rooms were spick and span and adorned with lovely Indonesian touches. The bathroom was humungous to say the least. We had an alfresco rain shower, while one of our friends had an alfresco bath tub! Do note that not all rooms are designed the same way. For instance, we didn't have a TV, but our friend did. Not that it really mattered for course when you have nature's spectacular vista at your door step.Without being a spoil sport, I would suggest that the management extend the shelter above the alfresco rain shower a tad wider. When it rains, and it does rain cats and dogs albeit for short bursts, you can't tell if you are showering in the rain shower, or in showering in the rain.Speaking of rain, it was a tad rainy when we were there in April. But kudos to the pool team for picking up after us when the rain came lashing down as we vacated our preferred seats in a huff. But as soon as the sun peeked out, the team was out there to put the daybeds back in place, towels in tow, and umbrellas bright and perky.Well done, guys. Keep up the great work. We will definitely be back."

","The staff make this place!","My partner and I stayed at Qunci Villas for five nights, four of those in the private villa on the hill (Qumbang) and our last night in an Ocean View Room near the pool. Both accommodations were lovely and very reasonably priced.The spa was often busy but we booked ahead a day and managed to get in for fantastic scrubs, massages and manicures/pedicures.The breakfast was very tasty and always cooked fresh in the beautiful beachside grounds.We often lounged by the pools during the day drinking young coconuts and sampled the deliciously made cocktails in the afternoon. Particularly good was the Bloody Mary from Nooq restaurant, made with fresh tomato juice. The food at Nooq was also very good, we enjoyed dinner here on three out of five nights, each night has a new set menu. We'd like to make mention of the staff from Nooq - particularly Esty, Dawiq and Budiana, you made our stay at Qunci Villas so much more. Mr Scott, your staff make this resort of yours what it is."

","Loved Qunci Villas","Just returned from a weeks stay at Qunci Villas.We absolutely loved it and it lived up to our expectations. We had an upstairs villa with an amazing beach view. The room was spacious, outdoor shower was excellent and the balcony was nice to sit on.The gardens and surrounds at Qunci are beautiful. Always immaculately kept, it's a lovely resort to walk around. The pools are awesome right on the beach. We had a peek at a few resorts around Senggigi and on outside appearance alone Qunci looks by far the best. We spent a lot of time around the pool and got to know a few of the staff. Always friendly and always smiling. Nothing too much trouble. Special mention for Ayu. Attended to our breakfasts quite often.The food was good. We found the lunch menu more to our liking but that was just our preference. Just one point of constructive criticism here. Staff made there way to the poll areas from around 11.30 onwards to serve guests. Would have made it that little better if this was available from say 9.00am onwards for things like tea, coffee or other light refreshments.Lots of reviewers mention the mosque noise and sleep quality. We knew about the mosque before booking. Yes you can here it. Where we were the waves were louder. But that's why we wanted to be as close to the beach as possible. Our sleeps in general weren't the best but we put that down to being in a completely different environment to what we are used to.The whole atmosphere at Qunci is one of relaxation in a tropical paradise. Lazing by a pool, overlooking a beach that has amazing sunsets. Doesn't get much better than that.A day trip snorkelling the Gilis was a highlight. we organised it through Qunci and our guide Edy was brilliant. We had 2 meals at de Quake in Senggigi which is a great restaurant. Highly recommended. (Owned by Qunci I believe).All in all we loved Qunci and highly recommend it. Hope to return one day."

","Pleasant stay - beautiful location","This is an attractive beachside villa style hotel with good spa facilities.The surrounding beach and coastline is very picturesque, and the property has a relaxedatmosphere.The ground floor villas are not very private at all - the pathways where all walk to the pool and restaurants are very close - in fact all villas are very close to each other.Food offerings at the restaurant/s are reasonably limited and to be honest a bit hit and miss in terms of quality. We found the Thai food served at the Nooq bar was the best during our stay.Their cocktails were also excellent.Service generally was pretty good - though not fabulous - my comment is this is not a 5 star property and it is priced accordingly. You will be disappointed if you expect 5 star service and facilities.We found the spa good - massages were reasonably priced and excellent.A couple of things to note - no TVs or ability to play Ipods in the rooms, no gym facilities at all,although limited yoga ( 4 persons to a session at US$20 p/p) is offered.The pool areas are pretty, but quite crowded when busy, and the sun lounges are all close together.We noted with some humour the old "" race for the best sun lounge"" in the mornings by some guests.Our room was located near the restaurant and we could hear the restaurant phone ringing ALL day and into the evening with room service orders....not ideal, and I'm unsure why they wouldn't have worked out a better system to service this problem."

","Great service. You wouldn't stay anywhere else....","Its all been said before in prior reviews: Rooms are amazingly comfortable, the selection of food from the three restaurants was vast, the tranquility of the three swimming pools and the 2 for 1 cocktails between 5 and 7 were highlights. However the one thing that stood out from all of these was the service. Not that we are in anyway dificult to deal with, but any request we made was met with a smile and a ""nothing is too dificult"" attitude.A special note must go the heavily pregnant lady who worked in Nooq restaurant and bar. We had something else arranged for dinner one night and whilst taking advantage of the 2 for 1 cocktails noticed something we would have liked to try on the menu (the menu changes every night). She arranged for the Chef to ensure that the follwoing night, the dish was on the menu and would be cooked freshly, just for us! Now thats service! Thank you!For something ""extra special"", try the romantic dinner for two right on the beach front. What an amazing experience.The hotel is beautifully quiet and there is also an adults only pool area. During our stay there was very little noise as the guests were mostly couples and a few young families. The only slight annoyance on the trip was nothing to do with the hotel or the staff. We stayed for 5 nights just before Easter and on our last night, 10 young Australian friends arrived who decided to take full advantage of happy hour and it very quickly started to feel like we'd moved to Kuta in Bali. Most people in the bar looked annoyed and it quickly emptied so they could escape the noise. Maybe one for the hotel to manage in the future given that Jetstar have just started flying direct to Lombok from Perth."

","Very nice","We stayed at Quncy Villas for four nights and it was very nice. It has three really nice pools and decks with one that is ""no smoking"" that is a really good idea as what is worse than trying to relax and the breeze blowing cigarette smoke at you! The rooms are really very nice, good size squeaky clean. I didn't like the open air shower and toilet very much, I also prefer individual toiletries not as is the case here, shower gel and shampoo in what look like vinegar bottles that have been handled by the previous guests. The staff are very nice here and helpful and the best part is the setting on the beach."

Try the beach BBQ on thursday night at an ocean deck table...an amazing experience. The staff were so friendly in every area of the resort and couldn't do enough for you. The spa is incredible and the plant based products used for the facials, massages and hair treatments felt and smelt beautiful.

","Add Lombok to your bucket list","Just spent 5 nights at Qunci villas hotel excellent service,location and food. First time to Lombok is much quieter than sister Island Bali however we found it most relaxing with dome of the best beaches we have ever seen. Grab a scooter and see Western Lombok at it's best including Autora Pearl Farm,Sengigi and stop off at the many bays along the way for a swim. Don't expect lots of shopping and restaurants as you will be disappointed. Gili Islands are a must see we did this in a dug out canoe boat that took 1 hour with our own private guide. Best snorkelling off these islands, we swam with many fish and even turtles.Sengigi Italian restaurant De Quake is another place you must try for lunch or dinner,Wednesday nights they have a guest chef Eroz whom I think may be the owner. The best food bought together with super friendly staff and cocktails in a ideallic beachside location.Can't wait to return to Lombok in the near future."

Beautifully tended gardens make way to two long and one small infinity pools with wooden decking and plenty of sun lounger capacity. The pools overlook the sea/beach and Bali in the distance. It was the perfect place to spend the day and watch the sun setting. There is pool service throughout the day which was very attentive and a Happy Hour from 5 until 7 with cocktails and spirit based drinks offered 2 for 1.- the food offered is excellent. Breakfast was brilliant with a really varied a la carte menu. For lunch the menu was equally varied and the food quality excellent. I'm embarrassed to be saying this as I should be touting some Indonesian speciality (which I did try and was v good!) however the beef burger was probably one of the best I have had! For dinner there are 3 options - Thai in the bar which we didn't try and then the two main restaurants offer two menus - one Asian/Seafood and the other Mediterranean with a Lombok twist. Both were excellent and thoroughly recommended.- service was excellent 99% of the time. We had one dinner when it wasn't particularly attentive but by and large it was super friendly and efficient from the guy on front desk who handled our request to change rooms efficiently to the gardeners who all said hello every time you walked by. Stand out service came from the guy serving us drinks by the pool throughout the day (whose name I don't know) and Ayu in the restaurant who was super friendly, spoke excellent English and delivered impeccable service.If all of the above were to be matched with the accommodation, Qunci would almost achieve perfection...We didn't want to go crazy on cost and so for the first time in a long while I booked the basic lead in room category. We would normally book a pool villa but I'd seen photos of the pools at Qunci and thought I'd like to spend the day there rather than in a private garden where, let's face it, you could be anywhere. In hindsight, this was a mistake. The first room we were allocated was on the ground floor close to reception (81) and there was no privacy at all. You would have had to have the curtains drawn at all times in order to not have other guests walking past your room to see you lying in bed. We asked to move and initially we were shown another ground floor room which suffered from the same issue even if it wasn't close to reception and by a main walkway. In the end we settled for an upper floor room towards the rear of the property (18). This was more private but had down sides too. Whilst there were still another two rows of villas to the back of the property you could still hear the traffic from the road. It was very loud. As if this wasn't bad enough every morning at just after 4 you were woken by the call to prayer from the local mosque. I don't know whether this was also the case in the Ocean View rooms or Villas however it felt that because we were close to the rear of the property and therefore closer to the mosque we were likely to get more noise than other parts of the resort. The room itself was basic. The bed was good and the air conditioning just about managed to keep the room cool although it could have been better. The bathroom was a real let down. It was small and the lighting was terrible. The only light came from six small LED lights inside the mirror. As a result the room was really dark. The toilet also smelled. I don't think this was because it was dirty though, I think they may have been using recycled/grey water for flushing the toilets. Either way, it wasn't particularly pleasant. Finally, you got two free bottles of water in your room each day. Anything further you had to pay. This is not a huge point but when you cannot drink water from the tap I would expect more than two small bottles of water to be provided free of charge. This is fairly standard in good hotels across Asia these days and I think the hotel needs to address this. The room wasn't terrible, there were just some big things that let it down and ultimately my main regret was that I hadn't paid for an upgraded category.In summary, give this place a go. It's a great spot to unwind. Just take my advice and book an Ocean View Room or Villa as we definitely regret not doing so!"

","Lovely warm welcoming hotel","A superb set up. We had a lovely room with a sea view through the palm trees. The staff were really nice, making a good effort to master a difficult name! The food was excellent, and served attentively. A choice of three pools to use. The adults only one did not have any steps for getting in and out and so favoured the fitter ones! Senggigi had some excellent restaurants, and the taxi ride was very cheap. In fact the three best ones had courtesy cars so no taxi needed. Our visit coincided with Nyepi, the Hindu New Year, and we went into Mataram to see the parade ..... awesome! The outdoor shower room was interesting, we had to watch out for the gardeners climbing the palms to prune the dead fronds!I would have liked a bar area where we could meet other guests, but this is only nit picking.We can thoroughly recommend this hotel, and we may well return"

","Perfect relax in a beautiful architectural setting","The Qunci Villas is a very refined and architecturally well integrated hotel for guest searching a quiet place with western level comforts and elegance. The guests, infact, are practically all westeners. The pool villa (where pool does not mean that it overlooks a pool, but that it has is own pool) enhances privacy and is very spacious. The personell speaks good english and is very friendly and attentive. Restaurants are excellent, as are all services provided. Real pity we only had 5 days to enjoy this marvellous place, so far from the chaos of Bali, but we will certainly return."

","Wonderful Experience","We stayed for 10 nights, hiring two ocean view villas. One for my husband and I and the other for my son and his partner. We had a wonderful experience. The rooms, the service, the staff, the views, the food, and the 2 hour happy hour each evening. The spa treatments were fabulous. Breakfast was included and was delicious, varied and plentiful. We ate lunch and dinner at the Qunci on most occasions, and the food was always very good. It was just too easy to carry on relaxing. For a bit of action, hire one of the boats on the beach and spend the day snorkelling and discovering the Gilli Islands, well worth the effort. Even after 10 nights we didn't want to leave. I do not hesitate to recommend Qunci. I hope to return."

","Expectations exceeded","We stayed for 5 nights in a garden villa with our 2 year old daughter and loved it. I was expecting great things after reading the huge number of glowing reviews on TA and was not in the slightest bit disappointed. The food was fantastic - particularly the thai set menu from Nooq and the delicious breakfasts overlooking the sea and Bali beyond. We also really enjoyed the themed ""Night Market"" dinner we had - lovely setup and a great vibe. The spa was delightful although on one occasion the front desk staff had no record of my wife's booking and were a bit disorganised and unprofessional. That said, the traditional massage was the best I'd ever had and the treatments generally were brilliantly executed. The infinity pools were clean, warm and deep although the steps and bottom of the pool were very rough and managed to graze my daughter's feet a bit. The pool areas were relaxing and there were always loungers available even though the hotel was full - we really enjoyed the happy hour cocktails while watching the sunset over Bali's Gunung Agung volcano. We did a couple of excursions: one to the monkey forest area and to a pottery village and weaving village. My wife and I dabble in ceramics but found the pottery village extremely underwhelming with one jaded and grim-faced potter doing her thing next to a large dark ""showroom"" of items for sale. It was interesting to see some of the island outside of the touristed areas and eye-opening to see the poverty that is so evident. Our other trip was out to the Gilis with one of the hawkers from the beach outside the hotel. His name was Zul, and I'd recommend him. He took us exactly where we wanted to go and was cheap (after a bit of obligatory haggling) and accommodating and would stop the boat at a moments notice when we wanted to jump in for a snorkel. All in all a wonderful holiday and we'll definitely try to return. Thanks to Qunci Villas and all the amazing staff. "

Perfect for a rest holiday.The only negative points are the quality of the tapas (good quality of products but no taste) and the fact that you are awake at +/- 04.30 a.m. due to the prays of the imam."

","Very very good but not quite excellent. Stunning pools and views!","We stayed here for 11 nights during April. The hotel is a very very good hotel, not just very good but not quite excellent. The 3 main pools are beautiful, stunning design and views out to sea. The only negative is the depth of the pool. i found it too deep to enjoy with my daughter as it came up to my chin so i couldn't hold her and play around in it. The food was excellent, great standard and quality and really reasonably priced. Happy hour around sunset is a perfect treat, we sat and watched the sun set with a cocktail every night. The rooms were clean and nicely presented. However the cleaning let it down slightly. Tea cups and glasses weren't washed, turn down service wasn't quite up to the standard we've had before. We stayed in both a garden room and a pool villa and to be honest when we go back again in the future we would just stay in a garden villa as the main pool was so nice. We have stayed at quite a few pool villas and we like them for their privacy really, but the pool villa wasn't private, we were over looked by other villas. Also we had to go and get new pool towels every morning which in previous pool villas were changed by the cleaners every morning. The size of the private pool was very good, but again found it too deep to enjoy with my baby daughter. The staff are very good, however the other thing that stops it from being excellent is the speed of service. If you are a light sleeper ask for the rooms closer to the beach as the road noise can be quite loud. Other bits of useful info: taxi to senggigi is only 20,000 rupiah which is a Â£1 so venture out to the town. Use a guy called Danny found on the beach to the right of the hotel for excursions he is licenced and very honest and trustworthy and is much cheaper than anyone else. There isnt anywhere within walking distance of the hotel to eat but there is a little supermarket across the road from the hotel."

","Disappointing","Sadly Qunci was a significant disappointment.The booking process is vague. I booked and waited ages for confirmation and eventually telephoned and spoke to someone who promised me a confirmation email. It didnât arrive. One week before I sent an email via Trip Advisor and eventually got a confirmation.The airport pickup was fine check in was ok, room was not available as expected but became available shortly afterwards.The room, (pool villa Qayla) looked tired and run down. Streaky black marks on the floor and all sorts of dust fluff, dropped hairs under the bed. The window sofa had cushions with dubious stains which looked to have been there a long time. The lighting is dire, the only place where itâs remotely bright enough to read is by sitting on the floor under the standard lamp. Not ideal. The aircon is wholly inadequate. The Panasonic unit is a tiny home style unit which even set to 17 â barely makes any impact.The open air bathroom sounds like a god idea, but turn on a light â even though these too are dim- and squadrons of insects appear. Before I get the response insects are inevitable, yes I agree I live in the tropics, but the light attracts them and their inevitability in the bathroom soon loses its charm.The bathroom amenities are basic to Spartan. The shampoo and conditioner are seriously diluted. I suspect not deliberately but by water from the shower entering the earthenware jars. The private pool was ok but looked grim as the floor is made of local black stone which makes the whole pool look grimy. The rocks on the floor are uneven and some are sharp. Walking on the pool bottom is not easy. The deck hasnât seen oil or varnish in a long time and the mattresses significantly stained. By the way Do Not Disturb on the door doesnât mean a thing. Even when itâs on staff bang on the door, you are constantly disturbed by staff seeking to put chemicals in the pool. If the door is locked there is no problem, they just come in via next door. So close your curtains.The grounds are lovely and well maintained and there seem to be a lot of gardeners. The main gripe has to be the breakfasts.The hotel ascribes to a la carte rather than the more popular buffet. Several responses on Trip Advisor say this is to reduce waste. It doesnât work as most of the breakfasts we had were sent back as waste.The Farmers Breakfast is weird I have never had scrambled eggs liberally laced with raw onion.The Eggs Benedict- was grim and looked distinctly unappetizing with its iridescent congealed yellow Hollandaise sauce, ok it looked bad but it tasted even worse way too much vinegar. Order your fruit juice early â it usually arrived after food had been consumed. The French toast was cooked on a dirty griddle or in a dirty pan, the black lumps on it were disgusting. The Qunci staff seem to be rather miserable and not particularly friendly. Even when greeted in their own language most of them failed to respond. One or two were quite friendly but sadly the majority looked decidedly glum.The sun deck at the main pools area is almost like a sunning deck for battery hens, two tiers of beds where you lie inches from a smoking guest. The adults only pool a great idea but merely placing a sign and then doing nothing to enforce it renders the concept useless.Sad to say that we had all except one lunch, pre-dinner drinks and a dinner at the property next door Sudamala Suites & Villas. The quality here in every area was significantly higher. The food better, the general environs more pleasant and attractive. The staff there were very friendly and helpful. Incidentally we tried both spas and their massage treatment was also better. One of the waiters arranged for us to see a room and a private pool villa these were much nicer than those at the Qunci.I wouldnât return to Qunci if I were to return it would be to Sudamala.Also why no gym or fitness centre ??"

","Probably the only reason I choose Lombok over Bali","Qunci Villas is just an amazing place to rest, fully relax and just enjoy. I spent 4 days at Qunci doing nothing but lying beside the pool, reading a book and just had such a relaxing moment. Service and hospitality of its staffs were awesome, food was fantastic and reasonably priced. I had the villa overlooking the ocean and sitting on the balcony watching the ocean was another fav activities. Room was unique and nicely design (no tv, love it!!), spacious and comfortable. It was holiday at its best"

","Beautiful setting, A tranquil Retreat","We were here for the last 3 nights of our honeymoon, we had a private pool villa ( qumbara) the only thing we could fault was that they werent fully enclosed, but still private enough, there are just a few gaps in the fence and the neighbouring villa could slightly see into your pool area. Other than that, it is an absolutely beautiful place, set right on the water with 3 infinity pools ( one adult only).We also had a private dinner which was beautiful, it made us feel like we were the only ones around, set right on the beach with the beautiful clear water. We had the most helpful waiter, Muhajir, Thank you for making our dinner lovely! The spa was great, we went twice and always received great professional service. Food was great all times that we ate there and they general feel about the place is really relaxing. Would definatily return!"

","The key to liesure and pleasure!","Stayed here for 2 nights and everything was just absolutely satisfactory. The huge, clean, and wooden room that is overlooking the lush green garden is worthy for what we paid for. With the daily set breakfast where we are allowed to choose of up to 3 sets was really good plus we have a choice of dining inside the restaurant or right in front of the beach. Staffs are generally friendly and are always willing to assist. Really an ideal place to stay for relaxation. Definitely will recommend to friends."

","Great resort","Stayed in Apr '14.Beautiful resort with spacious rooms for a very reasonable price (compared to other countries, it is expensive by Lombok standards). The staff were mostly very accommodating and the rooms were more than adequate. Stayed in a partial ocean view room for a night and the villa with a private pool for another 3. Just the standard rooms are actually sufficient as the villa is really quite huge for 2 people. The private pool is also quite a bit colder than the main pool in the resort as it is mostly shaded and smaller. The food is great and we mostly ate at the hotel, though it is more expensive than eating outside. The beach is clean and more private than it is in Sengigi where I stayed a number of years ago. There are still people selling their wares but they generally leave you alone if you aren't interested in buying their goods. The spa is also good and reasonably priced by western standards. It is cheaper outside of the hotel though, but that is to be expected.Generally no major complaints, though I did wish they had a bathtub in the toilets and it would have been nice if there were gym facilities. Also, it takes about 1.5 to 2 hours to get to the resort by car from the airport."

The meals are very very good and reasonably priced along with the drinks,happy hour cocktails.

","Heaven on Earth","If you are still considering between Qunci Villa and other resort. LOOK NO FURTHER FELLOW TRAVELLERS. From the moment I stepped out of the airport, I spotted our very friendly driver who drove us to the villa. He was very courteous and friendly. He greeted us and gave us a brief introduction. The management provided an iPad with information of the villa for us to look though while on the car to the villa. That was really thoughtful. The reception was super friendly as well, introduced the whole place to us - told us where the spa was at, the restaurants and the the bell boy brought us to our room. I was so excited and delighted that everyone is super nice and that all the staff spoke very fluent English. So you don't have to worry about communication issue. We had our lunch at the Mediterranean restaurant. Food was really really good. A bit tad expensive for Lombok standard but I guess this is the kind of price you pay in a resort. Spa was damn awesome Our masseuse was very professional. My boyfriend hated massage because he always felt very ticklish but not for this one. He fell asleep in bliss. I was really surprised but definitely glad he had a good time.The view for breakfast was awesome especially if you could have it at the deck. Although I do hoped the resort could do more to keep the touts away.Loved our room, it was a 1 bedroom villa with our own pool. Loved the open shower. Basically I love everything about Qunci villa. Will def encourage my friends to choose this place if they ever want to visit Lombok."

","Excellent Resort in untouched Lombok","Great resort if you are looking for a high quality stay in an idyllic setting.Many amenities and comforts, which are not always available in Indonesia. Anything from ice made of filtered and purified water to the excellent and friendly service stand out in this resort.The rooms are large with greats views. The showers are designed in an interesting way with an open roof, which makes you feel like taking a shower outside in the privacy of your own bathroom. Aside from that our room had an air conditioning unit right above the bed, which blows right in your face at night, that wasn't great. Also the room and resort have no TVs, which I personally found very good, but may not be for everyone.You can take small ships directly from the beach to go snorkelling or visit one of the Gilli Islands, which is fantastic."

","Excellent place for a relaxation trip.","My husband and I stayed at Qunci villa from 5/4 to 10/4 under the recommendation from a friend for our babymoon. Upon arrival at the airport, we were met with our friendly driver, Sansung. Very friendly guy, who kept on chatting with my husband the whole ride.Once we reached the hotel, we had a swift check in with no issue and was given the first floor ocean view room. The whole resort is amazing. from our room, we had a great view of the ocean and occasionally able to get a clear view of Bali. The room is lovely and we must said that the bed is 100% comfortable. Every morning we had a hard time getting out of the bed. Outdoor shower is awesome! The infinity pool is amazing as well. We are probably here at a non peak season thus the pool area is not overly crowded and there were always sun beds readily available. One thing to mention is that towels are not always available. Sometimes the pool boys have some towels with them and we get them fairly quickly. But other times, I had to wait for minutes for a towel to come. Also, I understand that the poolside has a finger food menu that starts from 3 pm onwards. If this menu can actually be available the whole day that will be better, because sometimes you do not really want to eat a full lunch while at the pool.There are 3 restaurants at Qunci but we frequent Quali the most. I would say the menu and food is average, although certain food do stands out. The lunch menu across all 3 restaurants are the same which is disappointing to me as I would like more variety. On our last night, we opted to gave a candlelight dinner along the beach which was very nice. We got ourselves entrees and main course. It was not too bad. However, the next morning before we checked out, my husband begun to feel unwell and started to have diarrhea. We concluded it must be the turbot sashimi that he had that resulted in his diarrhea as that was the only item I did not eat. This is quite disappointing. And caused us some inconvenience as we had to catch a plane home. Overall, it is a great place for relaxation and I will definitely be back again. Hopefully there will be better food on the menu by then."

","The nearest we've got to heaven!","Now I have found a place like Quinci villas I will be visiting whenever we can. It's a wonderful retreat for the whole family. The service is 1st class and the rooms are excellent. We stayed in room 15 which has nobody above so you get a beautiful Balinese style roof. The bathroom is wonderful with its outdoors feeling, the sculptures and art work in the rooms and around the beautiful gardens are a delight. We ate at 2 of the 3 restaurants and they where very good, we ate outside the hotel in Senggigi at 2 restaurants, the office and the Bumba. The office is good but Bumba was disappointing. We took a 6-8 hour snorkelling trip to the Gilis organised by the hotel and this was cheaper than going direct through another company recommended to me. We had our own private boat, guide and collection was straight from the hotel beach. The day snorkelling is not to be missed but be careful what you eat or drink on the Gilis as my hubby did pick up a bug from there. The guide was fantastic with my 8 & 10 year old and we saw all the characters from Nemo and even some very large turtles swam round us. Breathtaking!! Both sides of the hotel have waterspouts activities and my 10 year old son was able to get a surfing lesson for an hour and hire the surfboard for the day for 25USD. I also tried the hotels early bird spa treatment which included an hours yoga, breakfast, a foot treatment and an amazing body massage for USD50++. It's a must!! On our first day the staff made it clear that anything we needed just let them know and I must of commented that I was enjoying some 'me' time as it was the English Mother's Day. Well a big thank you to Putri who unbeknown to all of us had a cake made and some flowers sent to the room. How thoughtful and kind and truly appreciated.... Also a big thank you to Murtar from the restaurant, as when our daughter accidentally smashed her glass in the room whilst watching some television. He without hesitation took it as his responsibility to make sure everything was cleared away no negativity towards the children and then got them fresh drinks! A true gentlemen I would like to add. If your thinking of some time out to chill and relax after a stressful work life this is the place to be. Enjoy! Staff at Qunci thank you and see you again as soon as we can."

","A great retreat...","Although Senggigi isn't all it is cracked up to being the resort of Qunci Villas is excellent, spacious and relaxing.The pool and outside areas are very well tended. Although, there are lots of polite if not persistent hawkers who try to communicate with you during meals or pool trips from the beach.If you book a sea view room make sure you specify the rooms available on the first floor, otherwise your view may be heavily obscured by deck chairs, trees, foliage etc to the point where you can't see the sea! We raised this with the staff and they said it was a common complaint and moved us to a better first floor sea view room for half of our stay. Not perfect, but very accommodating. This is low season (April) so of visiting in the summer a request in advance would be useful."

Also used this place as a base to explore Lombok...hired a van with driver / guide for a couple days. One has to tour the various different parts of Lombok to experience in the culture, the people and the foods.We liked this Indonesian island best...much less traffic congestion than Bali, and more relaxing. We stayed in Bali in Sanur, at the Puri Santrian, which was nice; and in Udud at the Alaya Resort, which was great."

","My Third Stay","I have now returned three times to Qunci Villas having been drawn back by the excellent all round service with private. clean and comfortable accommodation with outstanding Thai and Indonesian meals available. The chefs deserve a big round of applause - The Thai meals cannot in my view be beaten except perhaps at a top end restaurant in Bangkok. Qunci remains on top of my return list. That all said, I do hope that the management will keep a check on the local beach sellers who can sometimes be bothersome. During previous stays a security guard supervised the sellers - he/she should be bought back into service to ensure a top class service to quests. Stay March 2014"

","Nice Place to Stay....But Food Just Average","This is a nice place to stay if you want to relax but the food did not match the resort - not bad, but certainly not great....and unfortunately if you want to eat outside the hotel, the nearest town is 45 minute walk; although there are usually taxis outside the hotelWhile staff were friendly and willing, they need better training to be able to satisfy guests...on arrival the agent at check-in was just reading the rules while a female plonked a drink in front of us with the words 'welcome drink'...delivered in a way that was not welcoming.If the quality of the F&B improves then it might be very good."

","Lombok known for its waters, 1000 mosques and 1000 hills","We had an excellent time in Lombok. Qunci Villa was the perfect place to stay for our party of 2 adults and 3 kids. It is highly recommended as it offers excellent view of the sunset as well as Gunung agung. We were taken care by 2 butlers Pak Andi and Pak Reme. They were absolutely wonderful. The villa was very private and comfortable. The only thing that can be improved is the villa should have hand spray bidet in the bathrooms. Snorkelling trip to gili islands is a must as the kids just loved it. Water visibility was good and spotted some beautiful fishes. We also managed to do the Sasak dinner and dance show organised by Qunci Villa Hotel. Will definitely return. Lombok is our new prefered destination. As for food, i highly recommend Menega Lombok as it offers delicious grilled seafood. Halal food is easily found in Lombok."

","Lovely resort","This is a lovely resort , a great place to chill and recharge one's batteries. Our room was fab, overlooking the pool and the ocean - loved the outdoor shower. The staff are brilliant , you are made to feel so welcome. There are two restaurants, we ate mainly in the Asian themed restaurant - no complaints on either the food or service. We both loved Lombok - we then moved on to Bali and witnessed what mass tourism can do to ruin once delightful resorts. In Bali, we were both yearning to return to the peaceful sanctuary of Quinci Villas - this place is definitely on my list for a return visit. Wholeheartedly recommend."

","Very relaxing","This is the perfect resort for a relaxing holiday. The rooms were nice and the outdoor shower was wonderful. We stayed in a partial ocean view room that was close to the beach. There was always a lounge chair available next to the pool where we camped out all day. The sunset was beautiful and the walk on the beach to collect shells was nice. The only annoyance was all the locals trying to sell productsâ¦even when we were laying by the pool they would yell at us from the beach. The food was nice and there was entertainment one evening of traditional Indonesian dance and gamelan. I will go back again."

","Beautiful Resort","There was lots to like about the Qunci Villas. Three big pools â one of which was adult only, which I appreciate even though kids were never a problem at any of the pools - meant that there was never trouble getting a lounge chair. Our room was great, with a good-sized private pool. The food was great. We particularly loved NooQ, the small Thai restaurant at the bar that changed its set menu every day. We liked it so much along with the great service, in fact, that we had dinner there every night. Our only question was why everyone wasnât eating there!"

","Memorable","Had the pleasure of staying at the two bedroom villa on the hill,a beautifully appointed and well maintained spacious residence that was perfect for our family of five. That outdoor shower was stunning. Every thing throughout the whole complex was top notch from the pools to the restaurants ,spa and more importantly the staff of Qunci. The rental of the villa afforded us the pleasure of having two kind and gracious young men care for us throughout our stay. A special thank you to Reme and Andi who greeted us with genuine smiles each morning and then whipped up a scrumptious breakfast. Throughout the day they were there to assist us in any way possible. Quinci will be unforgettable for us! Thank you."

","Nice resort with minor issues","We stayed 7 nights at Qunci Villas. The first days we had a private pool villa. The pool is really nice, big enough to swim in it. There are big walls around the whole villa and the pool to secure the privacy of the guests. However, room service sometimes came in without ringing the bell. Another day there were construction workers on our roof, which could not only see directly onto the pool, but even looked into the shower, when i was in it. As there is no other way to shower (except maybe in swimsuits) i felt exposed and uncomfortable. The room was spacious, but moscitos were hard to catch because of the very high wooden roof in the room, so we got moscito bites in the night. We then moved to another room (ocean view room) which had a very nice view and we could have our breakfast every morning overlooking the sea and catch a glimpse of the volcano of Bali. Furthermore we liked the interior in this room more than in the pool villa as it was more practically. Overall, service was very friendly, but we were really sad that no one took notice of the birthday of my boyfriend. We did not expect a birthday cake (although other guest seemed to receive it on their birthday) but would have been happy about a birthday card on the bed (as nearly every other hotel did on his birthday the previous years). We found the beach salesmen really annoying and found it very odd that they had their headquarter on the massaging spot of one hotel pavillon. Maybe they rented it from the hotel. Saying no to their offers, they will leave you alone for a moment, but they will definitely ask again later. I understand that the beach is a public area and the hotel cannot forbid them to go there, but it seemed as if the staff and the salesmen got along a bit too well. We spoke with other guests and really every one was annoyed by them. Although, the facilities and the surrounding is breathtaking and definitely worth the money, we would not come back due to the reasons mentioned above."

","Definitely worth your stay in Lombok!","Infinity pool facing the west beach of Lombok with the background view of Bali's Volcano in the day and starlight in the night. It rejuvenates your soul in every single way. We had dinner under the moon and stars, facing the beach into the endless darkness, feeling the wind against your face and hearing the waves. Awesome.All the staff there are friendly and will go the extra mile with your request. Everything is clean and awesome, for the one bedroom with pool its closer to nature when you bath, thus you will see spider, millipedes and ants all around. So do note it's difference.NooQ - the thai bar and the two other restaurants are with good ambiance and decorations. The food are good as well(we only had breakfast and a ""PASAR MALAM"" event where they make traditional street side food). Everything you need a room works fine. and the housekeeping is extremely hardworking. We found our room done every single time we are back into the room. The bed is awesome and gave us really good sleep.In this place alone, it's already worth your time. Qamboja Spa ,in the middle of the hotel, allows you to give your body a rest and rejuvenation. The treatment left us smelling good and feeling great. Thus do go and try!Thumbs up for Qunci!"

","Qunci Villas","We stayed at Qunci in a garden view room from 19-22 March. The room was clean and comfortable and the outdoor shower was nice, the toiletries smelled good too. Our air conditioning worked well, and although we could hear the call to prayer from the local mosque (we were in a room that was close to the mosque, road and reception) it didn't bother us and we went back to sleep. We have travelled in North Africa and other parts of Indonesia and the call to prayer is part of the local religion and way of life, and doesn't bother us.On our first day, a small cyclone swept through Sengiggi. We were in the town at the time and saw a fair bit of damage where trees and pier lines had come down. When we returned to the hotel, we saw that a large tree had fallen and crushed one of the pergolas beside the restaurant. Luckily no one was hurt and the locals told us that this was a very unusual weather event for sengiggi. I am only mentioning this because it was really impressive how quickly the staff got to work tidying up the damage and mess caused by the fallen tree with limited tools and restricted access. The grounds are beautiful and were almost back to normal within 24 hours. The one negative point was that a noisy chainsaw had to be used to cut up the tree, and this destroyed the peace and quiet, but of course we understand that it was necessary.The pools are all gorgeous and have great views over the ocean to the volcano. The hotel was fully booked when we stayed, and although we were always able to get a sunbed, it was not always in our preferred location. We were surprised how many children were staying at the resort as it certainly doesn't market itself as being for children/families, but there is an adults only pool if the children are getting too noisy in the other pools.We also requested a TV because it was raining, a guy was there and it was installed in a flash.The real issue that we had with the hotel was the food. One night we had the BBQ buffet which was excellent and delicious. However, on our first night I ordered the vegetarian gyoza (I am vegetarian) and ate the dish that was brought out. About 10 mins later the waitress bought another plate of gyoza over and explained that the first dish that I ate contained chicken. I was very upset by this, I have not eaten meat for 25 years. The staff were very apologetic and after I rejected the second plate of gyoza they gave us the whole meal for free (which was much appreciated but unfortunately there was nothing they could do at that stage to correct the error). I understand that accidents can happen but I really think this is something that needs to be taken seriously by management, since some guests may have food allergies with a severe reaction if they are given certain foods and others may not eat meat for cultural or religious reasons. The head waiter said that a staff briefing would be carried out on this issue, so hopefully it has been done and the issue improves. We were also given yogurt that had gone off one morning for breakfast, but this was promptly replaced when asked. Other than that the breakfast was great and had lots of options although I have to admit that I felt nervous eating at the hotel after the chicken gyoza incident.One other small complaint is that although our room (82) was very private because it was tucked away in a corner with no passing foot traffic and had no second floor, we did have some noise from construction in the next door villa which made it hard to relax. We did complain about this and the noise stopped. Overall, this was a nice hotel but not quite the relaxing experience we had hoped for, in part for reasons completely outside of the hotel's control (weather) and in part due to areas in which the hotel could improve (food and construction). The other reviews are very good so unfortunately I think we were unlucky during our stay."

","Perfect","I stayed here in a garden view room in Feb 2014 with a group of ladies.The room was large and clean, with a great deck out the front for relaxing on. The bathroom was indoor/outdoor which was lovely but a bit warm on those really hot days. The staff were brilliant, nothing was too much trouble and they went out of their way to assist - even checking we had enough ice when we had Duty Free parties. We checked out all the restaurants and the food was lovely everytime. Absolutely spoilt for choice when it came to breakfast and they were still very accomodating if you wanted something not on the menu.The grounds are lush and green and with a choice of three infinity pools ( including a child free one near the bar) you dont really ever need to leave the resort.The spa was wonderful. Very pampering and indulgent, every thing you would expect from 5 star luxury. While it may be a little more expensiive than the spa's in town - it is worth every penny to be treated like a princess for a couple of hours. If you are looking for a bit of pampering and relaxation at an affordable price this is definately the place for you."

","Quick get away and an amazing location","Just returned from Lombok where the wife and I spend an amazing 3 nights. We stayed in a garden view room and glad we didn't fork out extra for a sea view as we pretty much spent most of our time at the pool, beach or dining by the pool/ocean.The villas are about a 1 hour drive from the airport and costs just under $20AU one way by taxiDown side first, was the insects but what to you expect when traveling to a tropical location, as the bathroom is outdoors we had some ants in the bathroom and a cockroach on the wall (outside). One evening upon returning to our room there was a dropping on the foot on the bed still a mystery about half the size of my pinky finger, I thought it was from a bat that few in or maybe as the house keeping mentioned a gecko but would have been a rather large gecko.... They spray for mozzies each night when they turn the bed over and fog the resort twice a week so we didn't have any dramas with mozzies.Service was excellent and everyone was friendly and helpful, we tried the on site spa which was very relaxing, more expensive then outside the resort of course but that's to be expected. We dined at each of the restaurants and enjoyed all the food and the portion sizes were more then sufficient.Every afternoon we sat by the pool and tried many of their cocktails during the happy hour, all in all would highly recommend this place, it seems to be a very popular villa as the setup of the pools are the best with 3 infinity pools. The other resorts we walked past and sailed past seemed much quieter and I think the pool setup plays a great part in this.Looking forward to heading back there as soon as we can."

","Perfect location for a get away break","I visited Qunci Villas in mid Feb 2014 with a group of 5 girlfriends for a 5 day get away and it was terrific. All our villas were spacious and each had delightful out door showers surrounded by lush foliage....very decadent! We were spoilt for choice when it came to swimming....3 infinity pools (one adults only) or the beach? Choices, choices. Staff were very friendly and extremely attentive without being over bearing or obvious.Breakfast each morning was included in the room cost.....again, spoilt for choice with so many different options. Lunch was available either in one of the 2 restaurants or we could pick from the pool side menu. There were several theme nights during our stay as well as at one of the restaurants or in your room. Qunci also offered special romantic dinners which were set up in cabanas overlooking the beach. We watched the staff set up one of the cabanas and were amazed at the attention to detail and care taken.....all two hours!Would thoroughly recommend Qunci Villas for anyone looking for good quality, friendly service, exceptional accommodation all in a quiet peaceful location. The value for money is hard to beat."

","Recommend this 5 star property","Spent 5 wonderful days here, enjoying their 3 great pools and nice oceanfront property with a clean sandy beach suitable for surfing right at your door.Property, staff, service and food is top notch. We had a little ground level villa with an open air shower which was a fun experience. We went on two tours with ""Mun"" a local driver who we highly recommend. Try the waterfall or a tour to a Gili Island. See my review on the waterfall tour including footwear.Staff service was consistently wonderful as they are very friendly and we felt like family at this resort.

","Absolutely Amazing","My partner & I spent 2 weeks at Qunci Villas in March 2014 & loved everything about the place!! We did not want to leave!!We stayed in a Garden view room which was beautiful. We particularly loved the outdoor shower!! There are 3 big pools with plenty of sun beds... 3 restaurants with delicious meals that are generous sizes & well priced.The staff were wonderful & couldn't do enough to make our stay perfect. Special mention goes to De De! A great man!!The spa is divine & we enjoyed many treatments which were also well priced. My partner also had many massages at the beach front, a cheaper service also offered by the hotel. We loved happy hour - 2 for 1 cocktails between 5pm & 7pm. I recommend the illuson!! If you want a TV in your room - call reception & it will be delivered with 2 minutes. My partner could not survive without one!! Pack some ear plugs - the mosque nearby can be heard in the early morning. No big deal though when you are in paradise.Talk to the locals on the beach & buy some of their products - they are beautiful people who are just trying to make a living! They have some amazing stories & love to practice their English. Thank you Qunci for our best holiday ever!! We have arrived home & are telling all of our friends that they must visit Lombok & Qunci!! We will be back soon!! "

","Beautiful hotel","My boyfriend and I stayed at Quinci Villas in December, over the Christmas period. We had a fantastic stay, the staff couldn't have been more helpful. When we first arrived our door wouldn't work and within minutes they had someone sorting it out, when they couldn't fix it, they had someone else out straight away ensuring it was sorted for us. The staff always said hello and went out of their way to help us get taxis, organise food, get things for us we had forgotton (adapters!).The hotel itself is beautiful. The fact there are 3 pools means you could always get beds and the pools never seemed busy.The food is incredible - we were lucky enough to enjoy their Christmas Eve meal which was a fantastic menu, with a live band playing. There was however, no Christmas day meal meaning we had to go out to enjoy our traditional Christmas meal. There were also themed food nights - the BBQ was fantastic and you could eat as much as you wanted.We have since reccomended this hotel to family members who have also now stayed there/others who are booking. The ones who have stayed there also said it was one of the best hotels they have stayed in. Definately wort"

","Excellent in every way","We were lucky enough to stay at this gorgeous place for 5 nights and we loved it here. Room 1 was a bit noisy for us as it was close to the road and to the place where the staff would meet, but when we mentioned it to the hotel they were able to move us to another room which was much better.We ate often at the hotel and every meal was well presented and bursting with flavour. Quantity was great too.Service was with a smile in every instance, whether in a restaurant, by the pool or in the Spa.Talking of Spa, I had a Balinese massage on my last full day there. 90 minutes for $40. If only I had had it earlier I would have had several more! Such a great massage.The public areas of the grounds are simply charming - beautifully landscaped and kept pristine by very hard working gardeners. The area must be prone to mosquito but every two or three days they kill any emergent flies by ""fogging"" with an insecticide and as part of evening service each room is supplied with anti mosquito pads. Meant a practically bite free 5 days!The infinity pools are right by the beach,and they are lovely to cool off in - but then so is the sea just a few metres away!Top tip... There are vendors on the beach selling to the guests in a non pushy way. They have some great stuff but haggle them waaaay down from their asking price. A great offer was a 1-day boat ride to and round the Gili islands, just the two of us with swimming and snorkelling (buy your own lunch on one of the islands). Well worth the $80 cost (for 2 people) for about 7 hours"

","Luxuriously Stunning","The trip was a last minute decision and we managed to secure the last available room. On our arrival we were pleasantly surprised that our garden view room was upgraded to one with partial ocean view. The room was on the second level overlooking the sea from the balcony. It was huge and spacious. The whole place was clean and well maintained. The open air shower was quite a bathing experience and did not compromise on our privacy in anyway. The staff were courteous and genuinely friendly. Breakfast by the beach -- was a stunning view of the sky and ocean with the cool sea breeze. It was so scenic that we felt that for once, the pictures as advertised on their web site - were truely the real deal. And sleeping to the soothing sound of the waves.... what more can i say?

","Paradise!","This was by far the most beautiful place! We stayed here as a part of my 30th birthday celebration. There were 6 of us who rented the Qusia villa up the hill. When we first moved into the villa we were all so blown away! I couldn't believe my eyes - it was total paradise and was like our own personal resort. All of the staff at Qunic were amazing - so helpful and friendly. I would particularly like to thank the wonderful Eco and Rudi (our butlers in the villa) for taking such good care of us. We left feeling like we had made good friends. Their service was outstanding - nothing was too much trouble and they made the holiday that much more enjoyable. I would especially like to thank them for all the effort they made for my 30th birthday - we celebrated by having a 3 course dinner + canapes and cocktails pool side. There were candles and flowers everywhere and floating candles in the pool - talk about feeling special. Qunci was also kind enough to organise a surprise birthday cake. A big thanks to Witwit (the general manager) for all of her help too. All the food we had a Qunci was amazing too. Everything was fresh and beautiful. The Spa was fantastic, we all thought the services were really good value and all the staff were excellent. I really cannot rave about this place enough. We will definitely be back!Thank you"

","Wonderful!","Weâd definitely come back to this quiet hotel, which is positioned in front of the clean beach with well maintained tropical gardens. Alhough it is sometimes too hot, the outdoor bathroom is unique and pleasant. Only disturbing thing is the blow from the slightly noisy air conditioners in the bedroom. Replacing with a ceiling fan might be better because the room doors canât be left open in the evening without mosquito screens even though the site is regularly sprayed. The food, not only Indonesian but freshly baked baguette by the French chef is excellent.The staff at this hotel who we came into contact with were professional and polite.The nearest town Senggigi is 5 minutes away by taxi (about 2 US dollars) and there arenât interesting places to visit in the walking distance from the hotel."

","Paradise on Earth","Our stay at Qunci Villas was simply amazing, and I already can't wait to start planning my next trip! I've stayed in plenty of resorts and hotels in the region and even done some mystery shopping at top 5 star hotels, and Qunci Villas exceeds my expectations in every way, even outperforming some of these big hotel chains!This is such a charming establishment, the rooms are beautifully designed, the service staff are very friendly and courteous without being annoying, and the food is delicious. Don't bother heading out to town for food, we went for lunch one day and were very underwhelmed! We ended up having all our meals at either Quali or Quah our entire stay, the food is always fresh and flavourful and never disappointed us. I especially enjoyed the themed nights where there was a BBQ Buffet, the seafood was of top quality and I had such a great night feasting. I also appreciate that Qunci understands that we can get a little lazy while on vacation and provides the option of in-room breakfast, which I took up on almost every day. It helps that I had such a great view of the compound, and I had such an enjoyable time having my breakfast on my balcony every morning. The spa was especially divine, and I really have to recommend my massuer Ayu (I hope I got her name correct) who gave me such a fantastic massage. Treatments at Qamboja Spa are value for money and the ambience is perfect. I had the Javanese Lulur which ended with a flower bath that was absolutely heavenly! You can also get cheap, no frills massages down by the beach for as little as 120,000 rp, if you don't mind having your top removed in plain sight of everyone else!My favourite part of the entire stay has to be a tossup between hanging out by the beautiful infinity pools looking out to the ocean, and watching the spectacular sunsets in the evenings. Only thing that marred my experience were the beach hawkers who were quite persistent and took awhile to get rid of just so I could enjoy the view. I've learnt to just say no and smile politely and they will move on after awhile.Thank you everyone at Qunci for giving me such a memorable honeymoon. I'll be back soon and I hope to see only good changes! :)"

","Absolutely spot on","This is the best place I've stayed at for a very long time and we've been travelling for a whole year. It is superbly kept. The rooms are airy and spacious and nicely decorated. The pools are just lovely and the beach is clean and has a nice surf. The traditional massages were top class (thanks fandy and dani). I particularly loved the wonderful gardens and the attention to detail that the staff put a lot of effort into. The staff were attentive without being over the top. Normally in Asian 5 star resorts staff are fussy and obsequious which can be annoying. It is not the case at qunci - the tone is just right. Finally, the food is gorgeous. Breakfast and dinner are a joy and the menu is very original. I would definitely come back as it's a real find (btw i don't often write raving reviews...)"

","Beautiful and well-serviced, a few flaws","Stayed in an upstairs room rather than a villa. The downstairs rooms would have had considerably less privacy because passing guests can peer right into the bedroom. We had a room nearer the road, which meant some road noises, cock crows and soft calls to prayer from the mosque. Not a major issue. Rooms near the centre of the villa complex would have been renovated, unlike our room. Beautifully landscaped grounds with art pieces in and out of the rooms and immaculate landscaping throughout.The room had a beautiful thatched ceiling and was clean. No TV (I hear one is available on request). Lights were too dim to read by except by sitting on the floor underneath the lampstand. Not possible to read in bed at night. The window blinds were orange in colour and did not dim morning light sufficiently for my liking. Soap cum shampoo and conditioner come in ceramic jugs precariously placed on a high stone slab. Difficult to pour out contents (although possibly environmentally more friendly), Shower cubicle did not drain very quickly. Airconditioning was subpar, but technician and shift manager attended to this very quickly and (to my surprise), the manager sought me out the following day to ensure that all was well (it still wasn't great, but I appreciated the effort). Breakfasts were a la carte only and well-done. Eggs Benedict were excellent! Ate one dinner at the Quali restaurant - reasonably good food, though my duck cassoulet was somewhat oversalted.Service was good throughout. The resort was rather crowded during my visit and seemed to lack serenity thereby. The impression of lack of exclusivity was added to by the many peddlers on the beachfront hawking cloth and snorkeling trips. The Sengigi town centre is 4 km or so away - too far for a comfortable walk, but cabs are plentiful going there and back for about Rp16000-20000. Not a lot to see there, though!"

","Surprise holiday for my husbands birthday","I surprised my husband for his birthday (February 2014) and told him the day before we flew out to Lombok that we were going on holidays for 4 nights. All the way there, he was annoyed (verbally told me this) that he had no control over a holiday and had no idea what the resort was like. The drive to the resort - long and it was raining, he still did not warm to the idea of a holiday. Once we got to Qunci Villas and was shown to our room, he finally was able to forgive me. We stayed in a one bedroom with a private pool. We were both speechless with our room. Amazing is an understatement. We were shocked to notice there was no TV, no radio and we forgot out converter for a phone charges so we were unable to connect to the wifi in our room. After 4 nights of no communication from the outside world was a blessing. This enhanced our relaxation and gave us time to talk to each other, something we have actually never done in our lives together.I LOVED happy hour. After trying most of the cocktails on the list, I feel in love with a Strawberry and Mint martini. Watermelon juice was the other drink I fell in love with. I recommend both drinks at least once per day.I am and always will be a foodie. The food was the best I have ever tasted. On a daily basis, at each meal, I had a food coma but this did not stop me from sitting down and eating the next meal! For my husband actual birthday, I organised a romantic 4 course meal. This '4' course meal consisted of: an appetizer, entre, entre, a main, a birthday cake then desert. I was full by the main but it was so delicious, I had to keep going.I love how everyone was friendly. They smiled and said hello every time. The gardens were beautiful and maintained daily. Even the gardener smiled when we walked past. The staff remembered my name and remembered our room (I could not pronounce Qemiri and still can not).I could keep going on about how fantastic this holiday was and the fact that it turned out to be the best surprise in history but then this review would be too long.Well done Qunci Villas! See you in the future!"

","Best hotel","This is the best hotel I have stayed at while living and traveling in Asia. The pools are amazing, rooms clean, large and have comfy beds. The small patio area for each room is also nice. My husband and I were upgraded to a better room when we arrived. We were treated like very important guest the entire time we were there. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. They helped arranged a trip to Gili Air for our group one day. The breakfast is amazing! Everything I tried, I loved! The is also nice, but a little pricey. We went a short distance down the beach to get a cheaper lunch and Bintang beer. I would absolutely come here again and recommend it to anyone wanting to visit Lombok. There are not a lot of restaurants and bars on the main road near the hotel, but a short, cheap taxi ride will get you there. It was only $2 USD to get to the main part of Sengigi.Thanks for a great stay Qunci!"

","Magnificent Lombok!","My wife and I have just returned from 7 glorious days with 4 others staying in the big villa up the hill. What a magnificent location overlooking the sea all within our own private resort. The service was fantastic thanks to Ecco and Rudi (and everyone else of course) and the food - just terrific. We were fortunate to experience two special celebrations - my daughters 30th birthday and our friends 3rd wedding anniversary. Both events catered for in our Villa with minimum of fuss with thoughtful attention to detail including candles in the pool! Just a wonderful holiday and thanks to all at Qinci. We will be back"

","16 nights of paradise","We have just had a beautiful stay at the Qunci Villas, we stayed in a garden view room, which from the spacious balcony we could see the ocean. The bathroom was a very pleasant surprise, being half indoor and outdoor with total privacy. The room was cleaned and serviced everyday, with 2 bottles of complimentary water. The artwork and wood furniture is amazing.The staff are very courteous, friendly and could not do enough to make us happy.My husband and I had our birthdays there and received a lovely surprise birthday cake that was to die for.The ongoing maintenance of the rooms and garden area is remarkable and non intrusive to guests, in fact we enjoyed watching the gardener climb the coconut palms to remove the fronds and flower pods.The pool is beautiful and clean and beach towels are well kept and plentiful, always given out with a smile from the pool staff.If we go back to Lombok, we will stay at the Qunci Villas without a second thought.Thank you to all the staff for making our stay a smooth and happy one."

","Best for couple or group, beautiful spot","Qunci is in a lovely location on a beautiful beach looking out to the island of Bali and a magnificent dormant volcano. The rooms are well maintained and of good size. The staff are very well trained, were courteous and clearly enjoyed their job and the hotel. Day spa was good value and of high standard.The food was well priced and of good standard. The grounds were very well kept and pool areas were of high standard.Only down side, the bathroom was outside and therefore very hot to get prepared to go out.The outdoor shower was romantic but could do with some type of cover for the sunny part of the dayIt is located about a 10 minute taxi ride away from the main part of Sengiggi and there are not many facilities within walking distanceThe local beach hawkers get a P for persistency"

","What a great little set-up","I was fortunate enough to visit Qunci Villas in Lombok recently. It is definitely a memorable get away. Being a fan of Bali, this was my first visit to Lombok after 20 years and I can with confidence that I will definitely return to both Lombok and Qunci. The property is a great size and has a wonderful setting. The food is tasty and relatively healthy. They have a wonderful spa with well trained therapists. The resort is the right, with three small pools. I loved it. What made the experience most memorable are the wonderful staff and their attitude."

We stayed at two garden villas that are equipped with a wonderful patio. The staff is super friendly. The food is great - and not overpriced like in many other hotels. It even has good wines to go with the meals. Quinci is simply a great place to relax."

","The best way to discover beautiful Lombok...","Although I have heard a lot of good things about Lombok, I never really had the right opportunity to go there. Being in Bali for an extended period of time, I decided to give it a try and spend the weekend in / on Lombok. Flights are plenty and very conveniently short, making it a natural extension to a Bali experience. After some research, I selected the Qunci resort, for it was ranked #1 in the Senggigi area. And I now fully understand its ranking, for it fully deserves it: the team is very welcoming, the rooms are tastefully designed and masterfully maintained, the food is amongst the freshest and best I have had in a resort on a relatively less publicized island, the spa treatments are greatly executed, and last but not least, the very large (I would say about 100 meters) beach frontage with three distinct pools provides sufficient private space for everyone to quietly enjoy the view of Mount Agung and breathtaking sunsets. Qunci is as much a destination as Lombok is, and I shall definitely return, for such relaxing experiences become, increasingly and unfortunately, a rarity..."

","WOW! Fantastic Resort and location","On arriving at Qunci I was greeted by very friendly and attentive front desk staff. Throughout my stay nothing was a problem and when I lost my credit card at a local restaurant the front desk staff contacted the outside restaurant and even came to my room to advise me.My room was a sea view room, was great to hear the waves and watch the sunset.Breakfast was at the restaurant by the beach every morning. What a fantastic way to start the day. Then into the infinity pool and watch the waves again. Dinner by candlelight under the stars by the beach. Food was great and good selection. Sengiggi is not far away if you feel like going to a different restaurant.The beach is clean, water perfect, small waves and great for snorkelling. Even great for kids as the water is not so deep.3 pools all on the beachfront, which one to choose? Adults only or the 2 others.The spa, what a great place to either rejuvenate or relax. I had wake up massage with chocolate facial. YUM!I WILL DEFINITLY BE BACK SOON"

","Valentines day","I recently stayed for 3 nights at this lovely resort soaking up the sun and ambiance. Positioned on the beach front the pool feels like it meets the ocean. It is surronded by tropical plants and has tastefull decore. We stayed in a beach view villa upstairs (the resort only has two levels) and it has sliding doors opening onto a good sized balcony. The units were well funished with a large bed, couches, a bar fridge and safe. They had open air showers which were paved with river stones which brought the outside inside. The units do not have piped music or a television in them which allows for perfect peace. We were able to enjoy the sound of the waves tossing over one another day and night.The staff were faultless from the moment we were greated at the airport untill the end of our stay. They were able to understand English and were willing to assist us with all our requests. Some villas also have private pools There is a health retreat which offers a variety of treatments in a discreet secure environment offering the utmost respect. They have single and couples rooms. We had a rejuvinating massage lasting 90 minutes which was absolutly blissfull. If a no frills approach is your preferrence then there are ladies on the beach that can provide a basic massage at minimal cost. I personally prefer the ambiance of the health retreat and it is a fraction of the cost of Perth prices. There is no gym, however there are yoga classes available. Breakfast is different in this resort to many others as there is no smorgasboard. You order your meal the day before if you like and it can be brought up to your verandah or if you prefer you can have it down by the beach or in a small restraunt. The food was more than enough to start the day and was presented very nicely. In the evening there is a burning fire bowl on the beach side creating a lovely ambiance and you are able to sit on the beach side, sip a cocktail and simply enjoy the tranquility of the place and one another. If you need to re connect then this is the place to be.We had a romantic dinner booked for valentines day which I would highly recommend. Our dinner was set in a gazebo on the beach front and was had all the trimmings of finery- white linen, chiffon drapes, frangipani flowers and a special heart of red rose petals placed around the table. You also had a private waiter. The menu was limited and the food was dissapointing, however after discussing this with management they apologised profoundly, refunded the cost for the dinner and provided us with a complimentary meal the next day. Early in the booking process there were some issues with the finance department which is seperate from the hotel which were rectified, however during the stay I could not fault the resorts efficiency.All in all I would highly recommend this resort for couples or singles. It is very romantic and peacefull. You need to keep in mind that the hotel charges in american dollars. I would stay there again at any time and will definantly be going back soon. Well done to the management and staff of Quinci Resort"

","So very disappointed...","Sadly our stay was not a pleasant one.Upon arrival we thought WOW, this place is amazing - awesome views of the ocean from our room with direct access to the pool. Very comfortable room.So after settling for a bit we thought we'd have a bite and a few drinks near the pool over looking the ocean - so far so good. Food was good - Banh xeo pancake and a caesar salad with prawns (they were a bit mean on the prawns - only 3 average to small size on in the whole salad).After that we chilled out for a while, then had a few cocktails by the pool and enjoyed the fantastic sunset.Went for a massage at the spa then off for dinner at the hotel restaurant.Enjoyed our dinner there (at the hotels Quah restaurant) over all, a few minor things - beer was warm and the entrees were not that great - however they generously took one of them off the bill. Then came the mains - these were really good, and thats what makes this even more disappointing.The following morning we woke feeling a little off but not to bad so went for breakfast. On our return the dramas began... Vomiting, diarrhea, cramps, headaches - we did not leave our room for 24hrs as we were too ill. Had to have the hotel call in a doctor in for my partner as she could not keep down fluids or meds. Doctor put her on IV fluids and meds, fortunately the doctor was very good and helped her to feel considerably better that evening.Fortunately we were well enough to fly out the next day. Disappointingly on checking out no one asked if we were feeling better or had enjoyed our stay, so rather than make a fuss we opted to pay the bill and just get out of there as soon as we could.Over all must say we are so very disappointed."

","Stunning Resort on a very poor island","We stayed 6 nights in a pool villa. The first night was too noisy with the road, school and mosque from 5am. Requested a villa change at the front desk and when the duty manager came to work at 9am he found us having breakfast and gave us a choice of 3. Quite amazed we didn't have to chase up the request and that he sought us out in the resort. We chose a villa a little further away from the road and also away from some building works. When we are away we need to sleep well as we have very long days and broken nights when at home, as I do Joey rehabilitation. The choice we made was bad. The common areas for the staff were right behind and above the villa so we had chit chat and kitchen noises from 7am untill 11.30pm. Also the mosque still woke us up at 5am. We knew there were no other villas available so just put up with it. We loved the actual villa and pool even though we didn't sleep well. The resort pools and sun beds are great during the day and the staff are there ready to take any drink or food orders whilst you relax by the pool and beach. Sun bed towels are always being replaced, and there is no limit on how many you use as in some resorts. The food at Quah restaurant is outstanding, we had 3 lunches and dinners there and would rate all 10/10. We didn't rate anywhere else in Sengiggi apart from Sunset House who cooked two 1kilo snappers we got from the markets...deeeelicious! The markets were an eye opener) Breakfast was lovely sat along the beach front and we even got told off by a team member for bringing our own bananas down to have with my French toast. 'Tomorrow I get the chef to put on your breakfast' :). This place is very well run, the staff are first class and always have a smile and hello when ever they see you. Whilst we were there the resort was about 90% full, and still managed to give excellent service. We would have given the highest rating if it wasn't located opposite a school and mosque. If you stay nearer the beach the noise isn't noticeable. You have to wonder why they would build one there? Overall we would stay again as on check out the GM had a chat with us and guaranteed next time we would have a quiet villa."

","You Won't Find Better Than Quinci Villas","We stayed at Quinci Villas for 5 days as our first ""relaxing"" holiday. The exceptional staff service, immaculate property and idyllic views made it our best holiday in 13yrs (excluding Vegas where we got married!). We are usually explorer type travellers but we didn't feel the need to leave the hotel once, otter than to wander on the beach and check out the surfing and snorkeling. I understand it's only a short taxi into the main city area, and they are always waiting at the front of the hotel. Every meal from the 3 restaurants was amazing - and we enjoyed the romantic dinner in a private gazebo, a ""food market"" theme night and the menu that changes every day at NooQ. Meals came out fast, daily room servicing happened whilst you were out and didn't even know about it. We also indulged in the 6hr spa package which was bliss! We have never experienced such attentive and genuine staff - be it remembering your name, or the last cocktail you ordered, or walking up to your room to ask if you would like anything from the bar. We stayed in an Ocean front villa and WHEN we return we will be asking for the same one, or the one above it (although we did love the outdoor bathroom which I'm not sure the upstairs villas have). And I'll be reserving my seat in front of the infinity pool at sunset to do it all over again! Do yourself a favour and get to this place - you won't be disappointed!!"

","Totally recommend!!","This place is amazing!We stayed in the luxury one bedroom villa for 4 nights and then had to change to a partial ocean room because someone else had already booked the villa.Staff are so wonderfully polite and friendly, the food is 10/10 and the location is tops!!The spa is really really good, there is happy hour daily at the bar and the beach out the front is good for surfing and swimming. We went into town a few times, but it could be easy to spend your entire holiday in the resort.Town is obviously cheaper- massages, food etc. The taxi ride into town is easy & cheap. The reception help you to organise anything you want. We hired a scooter for $6.50 for a day. Turn left on the road & it is a beautiful scenic and quiet ride. We rode up to gilli islands. Tomorrow we are going to gilli islands snorkelling, which reception organised.There are some hawkers on the beach that get annoying, but they will only bother you if you let them."

Adults only pool was very much appreciated, thank you. Staff attention also very friendly from the driver who took us to the airport and one that collected us on arrival, much appreciated also. I do think that breakfast service could be a little more consistant and would recommend taking it inyour wonderful room. the rooms are delightful and the partial view room is beautiful with huge balcony. as people have commented, it truly is an amazing place and so is Lombok, a lovely place to explore, like Bali about 20 years ago!!"

","Genuine down-to-earth friendly service","My wife Diane and I loved our recent short stay at Qunci Villas. For us, two true indicators of a successful holiday are:1. Do I feel like I've said goodbye to a dear friend when the holiday is over?2. Would I repeat this holiday experience again?The answer for us is Yes and Yes! Although Qunci is not in the same league as up-market establishments we've visited in the past, including various elite resorts in Bali and beyond - we really felt sad leaving Qunci after our two-day visit. We WILL make plans to re-visit Qunci. The reasons being - the genuine down-to-earth friendly service; the comfortable and clean accommodation; the relaxing beach location and ambiance; and the consistent and enjoyable food. There's not much to complain about here! My advice to those who may visit Qunci and experience a few little niggles - do a quick reality check :) In the greater context of holiday stays in this beautiful part of the world - the positive attributes of this resort far outweigh the (rare) negative, sometimes petty, grumbles reported by a very small minority of Trip Advisor reviewers. Qunci gives many of the 5 star Bali resorts a run-for-their-money!"

We've eat in the middle restaurant: pffff the food was so delicious! Mie goreng, the steaks and the tuna tataki salade!! The staff work realy hard to serve every guest in the way they want, nothing is too much. Nobady complaines. The gardens are so nice and clean. Only 1 thing I can commend is about the people that sell their stuff on the beach. The security makes sure they cannot come in the property but that wont stop them from yelling at you and blocking the view with their stuff.. But hey.. Who can blame them: they try their best to sell stuff so they can eat and support their families. We are the ones on the otherside who are so lucky we can stay in qunchi :( so we bought a lot to support them. But sometimes it can be annoying."

","Loved it!","My husband & I have just returned from Qunci after a four night stay. We booked an early bird Garden Room at a good rate & were pleased to find on arrival we had been upgraded to a Partial Ocean View Room (which was really a full view!! Room 11). Thank you very much! We really appreciated this gesture. We found the service throughout the hotel to be excellent, all staff spoke good English & were competent in their roles. My husband is a chef/business owner & I'm Pastry Chef so we are quite sensitive to food/service standards & at Qunci we found these standards amazing! Special mention to Gatot who one morning forgot my coffee order as it was busy (which we noted & asked another waiter for the order which arrived quickly) & he seeked me out that afternoon by the pool to profusely apologise!To us it was quite obvious that from a management point of view it is run by someone who cares about their business & we could see the onflow affect filter down through the employees. It felt like a boutique hotel in the sense that it didn't feel like an international hotel chain were you are just another customer. It felt more personal :-)We loved the food so much that we didn't leave the hotel for any other meals even though Sengigi is only a short five minute drive away & the reception folk will kindly call one for you. We attended the Cultural Dinner with Sasak music & Dancing which was great! I attended the Spa twice, once for the Javanese Lulur (which I have had many times in Bali) I highly recommend this treatment, & another for the natural facial. We also both had a massage from Sap in the beach bale which I also highly recommend! She gives a great massage & at 120000 you can't go wrong!Well done Qunci Villas, we think you're doing a fantastic job & we hope to come back with our kids one day!"

","Good but not great","This place has a stunning location and is mostly well managed but your experience really depends on room choice. Book a cheaper garden room and you will probably be placed in the older section where rooms are characterised by a musty and mil dewy atmosphere. We did that but rapidly re-negotiated a partial ocean view room in the newer section for an extra $30 US/night. This transformed our experience. Eating options are pretty good, and dining whilst directly above the pleasant beach is idyllic. One other criticism - we arrived by Bali fast boat about 11.30 and understood that it might cause a delay before we could access our room. However waiting 2 hours was ridiculous, especially when there were vacant garden view rooms but not just the disappointing one we had been allocated. I wonder if that room 20 is designated for people who book at a good internet rate so as to encourage them to ungraded, as we did!"

","excellent stay by the sea","Stayed here for a wonderful 6 days, when we stayed in almost every day to enjoy the serenity of the place.Qunci is around 1 hour 20 mins drive from the airport. We engaged the airport transfer from the hotel at USD 30 per way. The location is not fantastic - it was 5 mins drive away from Sengigi Central (around 20K rupiah per way by taxi), and there were only a small minimart and a korean restaurant within walking distance. However, the location was not an issue for us since we stayed in all the time.Staff were all nice and friendly, and provided great service. There are 3 pools at the hotel, all facing the sea. We basically relaxed at the pool everyday, and enjoyed daily massages by the sea (offered by masseurs not from the hotel). The hotel has 3 restaurants, and we frequent Quali, which is the one in the middle of the resort. Food was good. Breakfast was at Quali as well, and you could sit at the bench facing the sea. They did not offer the typical international buffet spread. Instead, it was a breakfast ala-carte menu. They have toasts, egg benedict, yogurt etc. During the week we were there, the resort had nights like, Beach BBQ dinner on thursday, Pasar Malam (night market serving indonesian food) on Friday, and Romantic Dinner on Saturday. We had an Ocean View Room on the upper level, number 50, right next to Quali Restaurant. We were very thankful to get it, because the ground level rooms lacked the privacy we needed. We slept and woke to the sound and view of the Ocean. It was really beautiful. We never once closed the curtains as the location of our room provided us all absolute privacy. It rained for half a day when we were there, but we were contented just sitting by our balcony reading and enjoying the view. Contrary to the reviews, we were not affected by the prayers from the nearby mosque. Not once did we hear anything. Perhaps we were asleep too soundly :) Our room had an outdoor bathroom. Very lovely indeed, to bathe under the sun or the stars. We found 2 cockroaches during our stay there though. We visited the spa as well - Qunci's Qamboja Spa. Service was awesome and the place looks new and clean. I had the Coconilla scrub - it was not like any other scrub i had done. They use real shredded coconut, and squeezed the juice onto your body, and used the shreds to scrub for you. The smell and moisturizing effect was just perfect. However, not the same could be said for my pedicure and manicure. It was done on the second level of the spa, where lights were very very dim. The therapists were rough and painful, and the polishing of my nails were done badly as well. Under the dim light you could barely even see the results, and i noticed it only after i left. The therapist also dug too deep into my nail bed, and one of my nails were not trimmed well, resulting in pain the next day. I'm a frequent customer for nails, and i would say that this is one of my worst experience. That aside, overall, we are very pleased with our experience at Qunci. Highly recommended!"

","Beautiful location and fantastic staff","We recently stayed in this hotel for 9 nights and didn't want to leave. The setting was beautiful and the staff were amazing. We travelled with two small children who were made to feel very welcome and were doted on by the staff. The food was great and we only left the resort once for lunch in our entire stay. This isn't our usual style as I get bored quite easily but with three restaurants and a diverse menu we didn't run out of options. We had an Ocean View ground floor room which was very close to the pool and worked well for us because we go back and forth a lot and have a climbing toddler but might not be so good for someone wanting a lot of privacy. The balcony was big enough to relax on at night once the kids had gone to bed. Happy hour was fantastic with the two for one cocktails right in time for sunset. From a purely a selfish point of view it would be great to see a couple of rooms either converted or constructed to be interconnecting. We would love to keep coming back but in a year or so we will need two rooms and our kids aren't old enough to have a room with a completely separate entry."

","Luxury stay in a beautiful setting.","Beautiful poolside areas with good bar and tapas service. The breakfast menu had a wide range of choices, all huge portions. Sometimes there was confusion about orders, especially when we chose to dine in our room. Downstairs bedrooms had the benefits of outdoor showers but the trade off was very little privacy in the room and on the front porch. Upstairs rooms were better for this with a balcony but the bedroom seemed more cramped. We would very much recommend a partial ocean view.The only spoiler was that it seemed to be an older crowd staying there; the hotel lacked a bit of fun."

","cruise ship feeling","the hotel was packed. several rows of sun loungers in front of the pool and all full. we booked a pool villa and 2 rooms but managed to get the worst villa and worst 2 rooms closest to the mosque, street and staff entrance. one room was moved a few houses because a guest did not show up, guess that was a plus. the hotel has too many beds to call itself a boutique hotel in my view (over 70 rooms so must be up to 150 guests if full). villa is enclosed in walls with no views - could have been anywhere in the world with hot weather and would be the same. rooms look great but impractical (no clothes drawers, open closet, not enough plugs). drinks at the sunset bar took 45 mins to serve & no alcoholic drinks (only mocktails) are not part of happy hour. food is good but expensive for what you get for lombok standards. a place to see and be seen for sure but not a relaxed boutique holiday place.

","Exellent Place to Chill","Stayed here with extended family (10 of us), taking up 3 villas - over 4 days 3 nights.The resort is 1.5 hours from the airport, but the roads are good, ride smooth. Do stop and buy the super sweet and fresh fruits you find being sold on the way. You don't get them @ Sengigi. The hotel itself, is on the beach, and wide, but not such a large resort - so you never really walk that far, if you want to go to the SPA, or the beach, or the pool, or the restaurant. Everything is close by. Left something in the room? Easy! The resort is also very tastefully decorated, uses alot of natural wood/stone, very clean/zen like. Be warned that around the hotel, there are no shops. It is a 5min ride to the nearest shops, and taxi is easy to get (the hotel will help), and inexpensive - so only a minor consideration. We did mostly ate at the hotel's restaurant, as a result, and fortunately, the food is quite decent. The hotel has 3 infinity pools, with the extreme pool in the right, reserved for adults only, so for those wanting some peace and quiet, get your villas near that pool. The pools are deep - 1.6m - for those with kids, they'll need to be watched. Right next to the beach, it is quite a narrow beach, but the waves are very strong - since it faces open sea, unlike those hotels by the Sengigi Beach, which is housed in a bay. Our kids had a blast by the sea/beach, but needed close monitoring. Do you let your kid go into the sea by themselves, it gets deep very quickly, and again, current is strong. The good thing is, beach vendors stay off the hotel premises, and wander along the beach. The beach is not crowded at all, so it was very pleasant to chill. The rooms were reasonably sized, not the largest of rooms, beds comfortable, and air-conditioned. We did use the SPA a few times - they do have discounts for some treatments, so look out. Very reasonably priced (for a hotel spa), the treatment is very nice, the staff very polite, and go out of their way to make you comfortable. Do book in advance (day before), as it (rightly) gets booked out easily. In the end, our family had a real blast just relaxing, reading, playing in the pool/beach, hanging out. HIghly recommended!"

","Beautiful, friendly, a few rough edges","I recently spent 4 nights here with my family. Pros: -We all found the resort beautiful and design details unusual and well-thought-out -The pools were very relaxing and the rooms and ammenities luxurious-The staff was unfailingly friendly. -The beach was beautiful, though narrow (and because it was low season, the few people selling things would surround the 1-2 people on the beach). A few small things could be improved: -1 of the rooms we had smelled very strongly of mildew. This was one of the rooms with a thatched roof. While the room was clean, the smell was overpowering.-staff didn't seem to communicate with one another. Language was never an issue (every staff person we met spoke English very well and we speak Bahasa). Yet, we'd ask a question, come back later for an answer that was supposedly being looked into...and find that a shift change had occurred and no one knew what we were talking about. We were also assured that the boat contracted by the hotel would absolutely have a child-size life vest. We asked about this many times. When we arrived at the boat the driver said he'd had a contract with the hotel for many years and has never had a vest for a small child. These things were minor inconveniences, but frustrating at such a highly rated resort. -Finally, the restaurant was good, but we generally found the food somewhat underwhelming and overly salty. Local dishes were the best, but were mostly available for lunch, not dinner. Thanks for a lovely stay, Qunci Villas."

","Really fantastic...","Fantastic resort... Stayed at their Villa Qunang and one bedroom villa during our visit and is wonderful.Villa Qunang is a wonderful two bedroom villa located at the hill side with 100% privacy. Be sure to book it early as is always booked out as early as 4 months in advance (that's what happen to us). The villa also come with your personal butler. Breakfast can be serve at the Villa itself as well as dine in at the main resort area. One bedroom villa is located at the main resort area which is surrounded by greenery and is close to the beach.The staff is super efficient and friendly in accommodate our request. The resort is having 99% occupancy during our stay but we never feel too crowded. The resort itself have 3 swimming pool but we didn't get to try any of it as we are too comfy with our private pool. Not forgetting their Qamboja Spa which is one of the reason why we didn't manage to get our self out from the resort. The massage is so good and we can't have enough of it. Be sure to make your appointment early as is really popular. Having manicure & pedicure done at the second floor overlook the resort is wonderful too.It is really a very nice resort to stay at in Lombok. Wonderful resort, wonderful staff, wonderful service and i really can't wait to go back."

","Still amazing","This was my fourth stay at Qunci, having had my wedding there a year ago. It is absolutely amazing. The staff are so friendly and genuinely happy in their work, especially Nova, Wiwit and Viki. The only thing I noticed that was different this time was the French chef. It was disappointing that Chef Bryce had moved on as he was really friendly and very visible. I didn't see the chef in the whole week I stayed. The menu was also very French which I found did given it's in Indonesia and the vast majority of guests are Australian. I would also like to see the breakfast menu changed up a little as it gets quite boring after a week. However, minor details as Qunci surpasses any other hotel I've stayed in."

","Lovely and peaceful.","The Quinci is a lovely medium size resort. Generally more of an adult atmosphere..so, few screaming children. Very good food at reasonable prices and low corkage fee. Rooms areclean and pretty (I wish the pillows weren't so thick). Bathroom is pretty but outside, so that can be a plus or a minus! Its great to shower in the sunshine not so great if its pouring down. Didn't have a problem with mosquitos, but you might see a couple. Since its outside, its obviously not AC'd, I had no problem with that, but something to think about if your an AC junkie. Spa is quite nice. Lovely sunsets during happy hour. 3 pools including one adult pool. We keep coming back, so would def. recommend it. :)"

","Deserved of its excellent reputation - stunning","Both myself, and many friends from Australia, have stayed at Qunci on numerous occasions - both in the pool villas and the largest of their private villas on the hill. The villa was the most breathtaking I've stayed in, in both Lombok and Bali. It has to be seen to be believed. The garden view and pool view rooms are gorgeous, the food is great, and the service hard to beat in Lombok. I've just noticed a recent review canning the place - this guy has no idea - or must be confusing it with somewhere else more likely. Look further peoples and you'll see nothing to compare with Qunci in Lombok - and the reviews reflect this. There's a reason why it's so hard to get in on some occasions."

","lack of customer service - front desk officers","Last week, I stayed in Qunci Villas, room number 34. We happened to stay there because of my niece's wedding party was located in Kusia Villa (im sorry i dont really remember...). I reserved 2 rooms, 18 Jan2014. I stayed in room 34, my mom and her friend stayed in room 40. For the first day, my opinion for this hotel vwas really really good. But on 19 Jan2014, my friend suddenly decided to sleep over in our room (34), because it take a while from Kusia Villa to Qunci. I thought it was okay, because we will have a wedding in Kusia Villa, and as far as i know it was a private villa with 'no extra person charge'. I do understand about about 'extra person charge' policies, but the way your front office talked to us was so insulting, they forced us to pay 45USD, even i already told them that it was only for a night, and they happened to call me twice, untill i called my niece and she told me that in Kusia Villa ""there's no limitation"" about how many people can stay there. Then I called ur front desk officer and explained to them that we're Melly invitation/familly, who were going to marry in your villa (which i believed they already know), and my friend at first was stayed in Kusia Villa. Finally they stop calling my room, what a relieved... I do understand there's a room policies, but i hope your Front Officer could be more understanding.. To me, its a bit annoying consider that our familly would have a wedding party in your villas. 2. BreakfastQunci's breakfast was okay but not excellent due to the services. On the last day 20Jan2014, we're having a breakfast near room 34, i didnt remember the name...we ordered with devi/evi.. (if you need the name i'll ask my friend, because she wrote the staff name down in her notes. )Her services not so welcome, but ill try to understand it because we arrived around 10.25, and they seem bussy cleaning than welcoming us. So, maybe it's because our late order..We ordered an orange juice & english breakfast tea... While we were waiting there's a trainee offering us a cup of tea or coffe. I thought it was free, untill suddenly that staff (evi/devi) cleaned our table out of nowhere and talked to that trainee in a bad way that we didnt ordered that coffe/tea...so you didnt need to do this!What a terrible attitude, YES we didnt ordered it.. and we didnt know that we do need to pay for this or not..The worst thing was she didnt say anything and just went away like we were not there. I felt sorry for the trainee, because she probably didnt know what exactly her mistakes, neither do i. Beside those unpleasant experince...this hotel trully has a fantastic view,great food and a verry very good spa treatment..."

","Amazing piece of paradise!","Stayed here for 4 nights in a one bedroom villa with a private pool and then returned again for 2 more nights in an Ocean View villa after a trip to the Gili's. This place is amazing. The staff bent over backwards for us, and did everything possible to make sure our stay was pleasant and memorable. The food was spectacular. There are 3 restaurants to choose from. Each morning we had the choice of breakfast to be served at our villa or eat at the restaurant. The pools were great and nice to lay about during the day relaxing. The beauty spa offers some fantastic massage and pamper services which we indulged in! We even did the cooking class they have on offer here which was also just brilliant (thanks to Frederick and the Indonesian chef who showed us how to cook up an Asian feast!). Overall we had a wonderful honeymoon and we recommend Qunci to anyone wanting some time out from the world, relaxing, pampering or a romantic time away!"

","Great resort, wonderful service","This is not your usual holiday resort. The place is set on Lombok's West coast, in a location blessed by the sun even when it is raining higher up. This resort is comprised of a main location where you can find most hotel rooms, villas and restaurants and a location higher in the hills (about a 3-minute drive) where there are 3 villas (1 bedroom, 2 bedroom and 3 bedroom). The latter location is very quiet (even though we had to request that some works be held off while we were staying there) and the villa we stayed in (the 1-bedroom villa) is wonderful. Set on two different floors, it includes a private swimming pool and a very private setting. The free car service to get you down to the restaurants and back up was amazingly convenient. The personal was very kind and helpful. A great place to finish your holiday (personally, I wouldn't stay there more than a couple days -- but again, that's personal)."

","Fast and effiecient service.","Wondeful relaxing moment with family and in laws for 4 nights. All our requests were handled with care and efficiency. We do not have tv in our rooms and was surprised that they provided the sets within minutes.. i was just trying my luck anyway. Even to having breakfast, they managed to cater to my special request for my 7yo picky eater son out from their ordinary menu. Father in law ordered something not in the menu and was satisfied they managed to serve it with great presentation. Best location for having breakfast by the ocean. It's ala carte and part of the package room and it's not limit to how many servings you want. Just a note, if you bring children, there is no kid's pool available at this villa. Even the private pools are about 1.5m.You may get various type of floats at Mataram Mall and cheap too! The only thing we did not see was the island's famous Ayam Taliwang served at any of the restaurants of this villa. But it's great to get outside in the city with traditional ambience. Do not miss out the theme dinners that they have on different days and book early. There were some sellers on the beach but if you do not want to get anything just do not ask for the price. To make yourself comfortable here, do not hesitate to ask anything here. You can be surprised what you gonna get. Great stay and would come back to feel pampered again. TWO Thumbs up Qunci!!!"

","Thank you for an unforgettable experience","We had the most wonderful time in Qunci and felt relaxed from the moment we arrived, exhausted after a long flight, to a refreshing ginger drink and cool flannel! We stayed for 8 nights and had an incredibly special holiday due largely to the professional and kind staff.Everyone went out of their way to make us feel cared for and at ease. We have never before encountered staff who were so warm and friendly yet so slickly professional, attentive and adept at catering to the needs of their guests. The way the management seemed to be educating and developing younger colleagues was both inspiring and impressive. One gets the impression that the staff enjoy working there almost as much as the guests enjoy staying there. Surandi, Agir, Ezra and Luhur - to name but a few - greeted us so warmly and left with a lasting affection for Lombok and Qunci in particular. Food is really important to us and we were so impressed to see such a varied and difficult to choose from menu! There are three restaurants and we used to have a dilemma about which one to eat in each night as there were so many enticing options. We enjoyed sampling the local Indonesian flavours, alongside Thai and European food. The chocolate caramel cake, served very generously to us even after the kitchen had closed was divine, especially with the stunning moonlit seascape.The facilities were elegant and pristinely kept. The three infinity swimming pools, just next to the ocean, were a serene place to spend time and we really enjoyed having our own private pool which was smaller but still big enough to do lengths in. The staff looked after our room so well, the linen and towels were always fresh and we especially remember the clever way in which our beach towels were folded into an almost origami version of a dog. All in all Qunci is the best place we have ever stayed at and we highly recommend it."

","quintessential romantically beautiful Qunci","We had the delight to enjoy Qunci Villas Hotel for 5 days. It was amazing. Qunci is about 1hr 10mins from the airport, the drive from the airport to Qunci is a excellent opportunity to view several regions on your drive to Qunci. For us, the thing that made our holiday was all the staff at Qunci Villas Hotel. We have travelled to many places around the world and we feel that the staff at Qunci could measure up to the finest. We were always greeted with smiles and greetings. The food was really good, we did the romantic dinner for 2 which was special, we ate at all 3 restaurants and noticed many people dining from other resorts or hotels - it was nice to get dressed up ready for dinner every night and the cocktail hour was a good opportunity to trial many different drinks. Breakfast was also amazing and the juices ... yum. The design and settings of Qunci is perfect. 3 pools (and one an adult pool) lovely manicured gardens and beautiful artwork throughout the resort.We stayed in a one bedroom pool villa. I did enjoy having my own pool, but to be honest, we did spend the majority of our time in and around the main pools as we enjoyed the view of ocean and Bali. Our room was very comfortable , with a nice outdoor shower/bathroom and we were glad we requested a TV as when it rained it was nice to hang in the room and watch a bit of telly. Another good experience was we didn't notice any mosquitios. I armed us with DEET but it just wasn't needed. I think the mossies were having a party in Bali. We loved the Qamboja day spa, it was reasonable pricing, and I left having the 'best' massage ever. There are Hawkers along the beach, who try to sell items such as pearls, wooden bowls, sarrongs or DVDs - they are selling to put food on the table, or making money to make there next bill. Every experience we had with the hawkers was a good experience. I enjoyed chatting to Huggie, the Hawkers do not come on the Qunci property and are very respectful. You can also source the hawkers for a deal to go across to Gili Islands. (However, you can also arrange a trip with the Qunci reception staff). Going to the Gili Islands is a must, even for a day trip. Yes, Gili Trawangan is populated with lots of little shops, and lots of bars and places to snorkle off the beach. Hire a bike for $5 and ride around the island. We enjoyed a long lunch and a few drinks, it was an adventure, and I will make plans to stay there next time, even for just a night. Unfortunatley we didin't have time to visit Gili Air or Gili Meno so that is on the must do list for next time. Congratulations to the owner of Qunci, as we did mingle with the locals, and the owner was celebrated for 'giving back to the community' and very well respected for his understanding of local customs and traditions. I wish he was there when we were there, as I would have loved to have had a chat to learn more about the beginnings and the journey of Qunci after reading a book that was in the sitting area. Lombok: There are so many wonderful things about Lombok itself, first of all, it is nothing like Bali. Lombok is all about the natural beauty of the island and the people. Don't expect to go to Lombok to shop (you will find many mini marts), don't expect white sands (or at least in Senggigi).Lombok has some good surfing spots in the south western tip of Lombok. We read about the Pink Beach and the Benang Setokel Waterfalls but we were too comforable at Qunci and just didn't get the chance to visit - next time.With Jetstar's new direct flights from Perth to Lombok and Silk Air from Singapore I expect Lombok will start getting used to more and more tourists."

","An absolute jewel","Very occasionally in travel do you come across an establishment that leaves you gasping for more and slightly concerned that by posting a review will increase its visibility and hence the exposure and visitors that potentially stress the resort.Qunci Villas Hotel on Lombok is one of these establishment, the owners have struck a wonderful balance incorporating the natural environment into the hotel. There are three good sized swimming pools (one which is adult only), and three exceptional restaurants on site, with different themes. The grounds are immaculate and I constantly maintained by ground staff. There are two room types with either garden or ocean views all have a Island king size bed, ensuite bathroom and outside shower and are maintained to a superior standard. We stayed in the one bedroom pool villas, which are slightly larger and has its own private pool which is a good size. Each private villas is walled for privacy and is value for money.You can have the best kept establishment but it's value is nothing without the staff. The staff can either make or break a business and in Qunci Villas they make the business, all the staff are very attentive without being intrusive and it was a pleasure getting to know some of them with their individual personalities.We rarely go back to a establishment, but, in Qunci Villas we will make an exception, whether it's for a short stay or longer break you can't miss this exceptional resort."

","'kin lovely","Qunci Villas was the last port of call for us after being in Bali for 10 days and was a brilliant way to wind down after our honeymoon. The staff were lovely, the cocktails amazing and the views, pools and sea brilliant. We ate there 2 nights but did experiment around Lombok because the options for vegetarians are limited. What there is was perfectly good but not 5 days on the bounce! It's also, in relation to the rest of Lombok, quite pricey to eat and drink there plus, you know, it's good to explore!We'd booked in for 5 days and had the initial 3 days in a sea view room. Our genius plan was to have our last few nights with a private pool room but we needn't have bothered. The room we were given (think it was number 50 something) was located overlooking the pools and ocean (as you'd expect) and was brilliant. Honestly with the pools as nice as they were and the sea so good there was no point in our private pool. In fact, that room was situated at the back of the hotel and we could hear the road non-stop whereas in the other room all you get is the ocean - no brainer! We tried to stick with the room we had but annoyingly they were fully booked. I imagine they don't get people asking to be down-graded very often...We also tried the massages which are (again) quite pricey but literally brilliant. This is coming from something who dislikes being touched by people! If you get there early(ish) then there are some really good value deals you can get too so well worth taking advantage of.One quick tip is that many of the restaurants in Sengiggi will pick you up AND drop you off for free if you use their restaurant. We only figured this out towards the end but well worth taking advantage of.I'd love to go back if I ever have the money....which I probably won't!Thank you to everyone who made our stay so special xx"

","truly the number one in lombok!","My family of nine adults stayed at quncivillas from 11th jan - 14th jan . We booked four units of the partial ocean view rooms. It was awesome!!! There was nothing at all to complaint about. Firstly the staffs were all nice n polite n ready to attend to our needs. The whole resort was nearly almost perfect in every aspect n very well maintained. Foods at the restaurant was nothing to complaint about.The swimming pools were the best especially since it is located right by the beach and there were three of them !!! The sea waves were however quite huge n might not be safe for those who cant swim well. Its fun tho esp for those who loves surfing. My family enjoyed swimming in the sea n breaking thru the waves n some of them was lucky enough to see a baby shark as well. The sea water was surprisingly clear despite the generally rainy season around this time of the year.My only complaint was for room number 5 and number 11 of the partial ocean view units - the sliding door lock was faulty n we had difficulties each time we want to either lock or unlock that door.There was no TV and I was a bit disappointed at first. However later I started to realize that there were too many other things to enjoy at this resort n actually I wouldn't have time to watch TV even if it was available!My family and I had an enjoyable scuba n snorkeling trip thru FROGGY.SCUBA wch was based at nearby Sheraton hotel. We also had a fun time hiking at mount rinjani n bathing at the waterfall there. For the whole of our trip we hired a 12 seater van to transport us around and I just hv to mention here that the guide we had was really awesome ! His name was izzi from rinjani adventures."

","Truly and idyllic getaway","On many occasions during our stay, the staff consistently greeted us with a âHappy Honeymoon!â The thing is we were there to celebrate my husbands birthday! Even though I noted in the reservation the occasion we were staying for. Not that it was a bad thing, i guess weâre glad that even after 2 years of marriage we still look like newlyweds ;) thats probably one of the small areas the hotel could work on is the Guest Recognition bit. Other than that everyone was genuinely friendly and always strived to go an extra mile to make us feel at home.We booked the Romantic Package which included the accommodation in the one bedroom pool villa, a couple spa session and a romantic dinner in their gazebo. I personally felt that this package was highly value for our money. The spa was wonderful and the food served at the restaurants was beyond belief! The prices could be half of what hotels in Bali would charge. The daily in room breakfast was also great.Many reviewers complained about the beach hawkers selling their goods, we did not find it much of a disturbance as most were extremely polite and would take no for an answer. They also do not come onto the hotel property. More over the hotel security were always around to ensure that no one crosses the boundary.The room was huge and spacious and the pool was clean and gorgeous. The down side is that the villa is located close to the main road and Mosquitoes do seem to be a problem, even with the hotels twice weekly fogging, I believe the design of the villa bathroom could be improved on to prevent the mosquitoes from entering. Maybe if they could install a glass screen between the shower area and the rest of the bathroom to prevent the mosquitoes and other insects from entering. Most of the bites we got were when we were using the loo! Overall we had a wonderful time staying in Qunci and look forward to returning again hopefully soon!."

","Great relaxation!","My fiance and I spent a little weekend at Qunci, and were impressed with how they manage to create this calm meditative atmosphere on such a relatively big resort (about 80 rooms?). We came from busy and rustic Jakarta, and were really pleasantly shocked by the difference :) The staff was very friendly and nice, room was clean, half-opened bathroom was lovely (I experienced it first time in my life and it was great!). All the grounds are well maintained: palms, grass, flowers and other plants, and the design is so beautiful, especially around the pool! We had lazy awesome few hours at the pool with cocktails during ""happy hour"" (5-7 pm), watching the stunning sunset and surfers catching the waves. In some previous reviews I've read that the hawkers walking through the beach can be annoying, but really they were not, they didn't harrass, they were not annoying and even sometimes added some fun :) Generally, there were just few vendors and they didn't spoil or interfer our rest.The food was always of good quality, fresh. I regret we tried only 1 restaraunt, and din't try the second one where the international dishes are served, I'm sure it was very good!It's also very easy to catch a taxi there - always at least 1 Bluebird waiting just in front of the gate, and it takes just some minutes to reach main Sengiggi touristic area where lots of restaraunts, shops etc are located. Families with kids might also like it, this place is not a noisy party resort, it's very calm and comfortable.We loved the relaxing atmosphere, design, and we consider this place as our #1 for little getaways. We really didn't want to leave and will surely come back again."

","Authentic Lombok. very comfortable and beautiful hotel","Lombok is an authentic Indonesian island and you can made nice trips around the country to the vulcano , local markets, forests and of course beautiful beaches. It is not so cultural as Bali and the people are very poor, then it is quite different from what you can have from Bali but also very cheap in comparaison. We spent a week in the hotel and we were very happy of our stay there whit very nice cooking, not expensive and with good products. Turbot shashimi is a must as well as the smoked turbot, and you can find also local food accomodate for europeen palait. People are exquisite and charming."

","Beachside resort delivers zen and tranquility","Did not disappoint (for the most part). The property is beautiful, very well cared for with an abundance of staff that are extremely attentive yet not in your face annoying. The staff have a very good understanding of English, very kind and greeted our kids by name every time. The rooms were clean and spacious as were the outdoor bathrooms - overall beautiful! Loved the outdoor porch where you could enjoy an afternoon nap on the comfy day bed or enjoy an evening drink once the kids fell asleep. The food at the Quali restaurant was good and surprisingly not overly expensive given it was a resort restaurant. Breakfasts are included and fantastic. They were very accommodating to making sure our kids got their food first and brought extra pancakes without hesitating. The 3 pools (one is adult only) overlook the beach and are long enough to swim laps before enjoying a hearty breakfast next door. Pool staff is very attentive bringing fresh towels, ice water and cleaning up. The negatives are not big but worth mentioning. The beach isn't great and I would not recommend it for young kids. Not enough beach to play in the sand and the water was quite rough. There is constantly someone trying to sell you t-shirts, sarongs and other local art. They are not allowed on the property but as you sit on the deck overlooking the beach watching the sunset go down you are being hounded to buy something. Even after politely declining repeatedly the hard sell continues - harmless but annoying. Don't order the Parisian basket for breakfast. It comes with 3 jams that attracts swarms of bees (but it is tasty!) We spent 6 nights with our kids and their grandparents and everyone had an amazing time!"

","Qunci Villas - The key to a perfect holiday","Loved, loved, loved our first experience in Lombok, mostly thanks to Qunci and the staff. We stayed during December 2013 in a Villa with a private pool and can not find fault. Nova was extremely welcoming and has excellent English. He always remembered our names when he saw us and always stopped to say hi which is always nice. The spa, Oh my God, the staff are professional and do an amazing job, had me and my partner snoring each time we visited. I loved that every night when we came back to our villa that it was tidied and bed turned down ready for us. They also spray the room for mosquito's which I greatly appreciated as they tend to like my blood a little too much. The food was amazing as was the service at all of the restaurants. I didn't find the hawkers intrusive as other guests suggest. They clearly haven't been to Kuta. Usually if you say no once they accept that and walk on. There was no gym, but in truth I didn't mind that too much, good excuse to completely relax. If you love art then a walk around is a must. We loved Qunic so much that we have chosen to get married there in 2015. Thank you Qunci and staff. I look forward to organising my wedding with you."

","Location, location, location!","Right on the water's edge north of Sengigi in Lombok, we reserved villas in April for our December trip based on a recommendation from a family member who insisted we stay here. Our 4 day experience didn't disappoint on any dimension. The service was impeccable, the food excellent, our rooms were exactly as ordered, the spa was so relaxing, and the front desk staff so helpful. But, most memorable was the location. 3 infinity pools which share a wall with the ocean wall, didn't feel crowded at all in spite of the resort being full over the Dec/Jan NYE holiday. The 21% service charge and tax took all the judgement away for tipping (they earned all of it). Many on the staff said they had been there for many years (it showed!). A must go, and will find a way to come back here."

","Above average - A good place to relax","I agree with the comment by trevorb999--especially on the mosquito problem. We spent 4 nights at Qunci & came back home with quite some mosquito bite-marks. The place is perfect for couples who crave for romantic settings with scenery of Mount Agung in Bali as the sun sets.For you who likes to hunt for good foods--finding good & authentic Lombok food may be a challenge as you would need to travel quite a distance from this resort. Otherwise, to settle on delicacies offered onsite should not be a problem (but, taste was just OK, in my humble opinion. But again). This wasn't a problem to us as the main reason we stayed at this hotel is to completely laze around & to relax. Otherwise, for those looking for other activities--learn to Surf just in front of the beach (I did).The staffs were attentive. During our stay, it was unfortunate that my two year old got a fever (as the wind was very strong in December). The staffs were alert to attend to our needs for an on-call doctor and the kitchen was kind enough to serve special breakfast for my two year old who were a bit choosy in eating due to fever."

","Above average, not excellent","If I could score a 3.5, I probably would!The location is very good, on the beach with fantastic views of Bali on a clear day.The 3 pools and sun-beds certainly meet expectations, and a day trip to the Gilis is strongly recommended.Attitude of the waiting staff is very good, however their aptitude is questionable (certainly for us anyway, with 3 orders including mistakes).There is a mosquito problem at the resort and I'd probably recommend to the management to fog everyday (and to regularly check rooms).Unfortunately, I found the front of house staff lacking in (resort) knowledge, and one in particular quite unconcerning of guests' problems.Finally, the spa is most certainly worth visiting as the treatments and staff are of a good standard."

","What a Resort!","We spent 5 days at Qunci Villas and it was such a great experience. From the moment you check in you feel completely at ease at this place. There are 3 restaurants, 3 pools, spa and treatment centre. The rooms are really nice as well. We stayed in a Seaview room with an enormous balcony. The staff are so incredibly nice and helpful. We really struggled leaving the resort as it has everything you need."

","Exceeded expectations","We stayed in the luxury 2 bed villa which was perfect in so many ways. The villa offered seclusion from the main part of the hotel, it's own fantastic swimming pool and the butler service. Our butler Oni was absolutely outstanding, attentive and very professional. The villa was very comfortable and dining there was a pleasure. The hotel offered a few different restaurants around the pool and beach area. All the food was lovely and we particularly enjoyed the Thai. Happy hour of cocktails was also great! The pool and gardens were extremely well kept and everything was very clean. The beach was lovely but not the best. This didnt matter so much with such a great pool area to enjoy. We enjoyed a number of treatments at the spa which was so peaceful and well done. The treatments were amazing!! The balinese massage and wrap with the flower bath were a big highlight of the stay! Diana, the therapist, was particularly good.The staff throughout the hotel were outstanding and really helped this resort stand out. I would highly recommend the Qunci villas."

","Beautiful location, fantastic service!","I brought my 8 month old baby to this beautiful place and all of us enjoyed ourselves immensely. The food was amazing, the service could rival big brand hotels. Nooq the little bar cafe that served Thai food deserves a special mention. The Thai food was on par or even better than the hotel restaurants in Phuket. The owner took pride in adding a special touch with the art pieces scattered around the property. The spa service was lovely too. However, imho, what sets this place apart is how comfortable everything is, including the $$. ;p (Please don't increase the price!!)"

","Outstanding in Lombok","The staff have been brilliantly trained, they are attentive, pre-emptive and professional.We stayed in a private villa up the hill. It was secluded, private and extremely luxurious, just as we had hoped for. Our private butlers were varied, one being outstanding in every way, the other just average and not very pre-emptive in his service. Having to ask somebody to do something for you is not expected at this end of the market.The private villas are very well appointed, excellent pools and furnishings. Sound system, internet and DVDs to watch was an unexpected bonus. The dining arrangements are great and you can have any food you like prepared in the main kitchen and brought to you or a chef cook for you in villa.The main hotel is also very pleasant and each of the restaurants serves good, but expensive food. The thai bar/restaurant NooQ was the standout venue, being quieter and offering a superb thai 5 course tasting menu at good value.The pools are nice and there are great cabins to sit in. The beach is not a highlight but it is nice for a walk.The single most annoying thing about this place that the owners really need to get on top of is the annoying beach hawkers who try to ply their tat to guests. Now, I do know SE Asia and that this is standard behaviour, but paying to stay in a luxury residence I expect to be exempted from this behaviour. The worst thing of all is that it is the same people everyday who seem to be somehow associated with the hotel (permitted?) and it would be fine if they offered their goods once and moved on when you said ""no thank"" but they do not, they bob around trying to get your attention and ask you the same thing every 10-mins as if you are a different person. The man selling crappy wooden bowls was particularly annoying and should be removed.Overall very good though"

The grounds are well maintained and the garden art fits perfectly in the selected spaces. The staff is very attentive to the needs of the guest and aren't afraid to chat with guest if given the opportunity to speak. The food is delicious! I enjoyed the exceptional view of the ocean from the infinity pool even before I had one too many margaritas!

","Paradise in Lombok","My husband and I stayed at Qunci for 9 days and would highly recommend this property. We stayed in a partial ocean view upstairs villa which was beautifully decorated extremely clean and very comfortable. The staff are all very friendly and helpful above and beyond expectations. The three pool areas are all magnificent with plenty of pool lounges and a beautiful view of the ocean and beyond to Mount Agung over on Bali. We ate at the restaurants the whole time as the price of meals were extremely reasonable and the quality of food excellent. Average meal prices were averaging under 100,000 Rp for a main. The breakfast which was included in our room rate was always excellent and the menu was varied. We also enjoyed treatments at the hotels Qamboja Spa which were again surprisingly well priced and of excellent quality. Thanks Qunci for the most relaxing holiday, you are doing an excellent job and we can't wait to return soon."

We stayed at villa overlooking beach and right next to pool and our adult children were in two bedroom villa with own pool. Rooms are great. Staff are so friendly and helpful they really make the stay enjoyable. The only complaint was the food in the restaurants is bland and not real Indonesian food. Food is mediocre and I would recommend dining out in some really good restaurants in Senggiggi such as the Square and Yessae where the food is better and cheaper prices.Overall fantastic location with great staff but dine out when you can."

","Wow. Like, wow!","This is a very carefully put together place. Here in the wet quiet season, but the resort still makes it worthwhile. The staff are genuinely friendly and the grounds are very well maintained. With the exception of one small dish of chicken broth, every course of every meal has been a stand out taste; and I mean every one, with the quality better than the best restaurants I have ever indulged around the world. Whilst not an art lover, the way art has been seamlessly included into every aspect of the surroundings means its beauty is there if and when you choose to appreciate it. This place would have to be up there with the very best of the small luxury resorts of the world and a reason to come to Lombok in itself."

","Okay experience overall.","My husband and I stayed at Qunci for our wedding/honeymoon. We were recommended by a work colleague to try it out. Overall the experience was very good. We decided to elope at Qunci and although the experience was good overall, there were some things that we weren't too happy about. First of all, it wasn't a private scenery for our wedding ceremony - we had hawkers taking photo's of us while we were exchanging our vows which made us uncomfortable. They played the wrong song on our wedding day and the celebrant said to me , ""That's soo sad that your family is not here to celebrate your day!"" - It wasn't the celebrant to make comments regarding our decision to elope. I paid $200 to get my hair and make up done and I've realised now that it was a waste of money. The lady who did my make -up did not know what she was doing and at one stage I had to take control of putting my makeup on which was annoying. On the upside, Wiwit who is the General Manager of the place was accommodating and was there to assist the whole day. The photography that we've received was amazing and we received our digital prints and album the next day. The dinner that we've received after our ceremony was excellent. It was a three course meal and it was delish! We hired a private villa with a pool and we enjoyed the facilities at Qunci. it was well maintained and the rooms were kept clean at all times (apart from our private pool which had green algae all the way through it - considering what you're paying for the accommodations, you'd expect that the pool be well maintained). The view of the beach was good, however, be aware of people trying to sell you stuff on the beach and because the resort has full view of the beach, you really can't hide from the hawkers. That was the thing that ruined the experience because it made us not want to go near the beach because we didn't want to be constantly harassed. This happened every morning, day and night - it was constant - so be aware. The staff were friendly and helpful and knew your name which was a nice touch to customer service. The thing that ruined the experience would be the constant interruption that we had from the staff. On the first few days, we would get interrupted by the staff such as having them to come into the villa to remove the sofa's from the sun lounge, then it would be to come into the room to fix wiring in the room etc. In the end, we had to put ""privacy"" tag the front of our villa. They would make our bed when we didn't request it and even at night, they would come into the room to make the bed for no reason while we were out. It seems there was no sense of privacy there which we ordered a private villa for privacy."

","Perfect villas, dining, spa and magical sea view","We stayed in a one bedroom villa for 8 nights and loved every minute of our stay. The villa was spacious and quiet with a little balcony with partial sea views. The service at Qunci was great and we were greeted with a honeymoon cake and a flower set up upon arrival, as we were on our honeymoon. The food in the two restaurants was absolutely delicious and is by far the best food you will find anywhere else in the area. As my husband is vegetarian, the options were a bit limited though. As a Pescetarian it was paradise and the fresh Tuna steak in a wasabi marinade is to die for... They also had changing theme evenings every night with different menus throughout the week on top of the regular menu. We went to the spa twice and it was great. We were greeted with a welcome drink and the treatments were fantastic. The staff was excellent- very attentive and friendly from the reception, to the restaurants to the spa. The evening cocktail hour is fantastic and it was magical watching the beautiful sunset with a cocktail by the sea. We also really loved having breakfast right by the sea, instead of the restaurant. Amazing view!"

","NO REVIEW CAN EVER BEAT A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF THE QUNCI VILLA HOSPITALITY","We were in Lombok for our 20th anniversary/honeymoon 27-30Nov.. After reading many positive reviews from visitors, we decided on QUNCI VILLA for our 3 night stay. Stayed in Room 72 with partial seaview. The room is spacious, tastefully decorated with wall art, flowers, decorative items. Open air shower. We fell in love with this lovely abode as we continued our stay. The 3 gorgeous infinite pools are so inviting that we swam every day. The well manicured and well planned landscape can be enjoyed the moment guests arrive at the reception, around the restaurants, the pools, spa etc. Magnificent sunset. QUNCI Villa is a photographer haven. Compliment must be extended to the owner, Scott Coffey & the architect, J. Grieken who came out with this very inspiring product. Every corner that we went, we were greeted by collections of unique pieces of furniture and decorative accessories. QUNCI VILLA is a place to meet the pleasure of all your senses. It is a GALLERY by itself !Breakfast is served in various international set meal. Food quality is good with theme dinner most of the nights. Staff are super friendly, prompt to your request. Room service is up to markOnly thing it will be sweet if QUNCI VILLA can provide welcome turndown gift (eg. chocolate or fruit basket) for special occassion eg. honeymooners, birthday person. SPA :- must try. Location :- 5-8min drive to Senggigi town. Taxi RP15000 per way per paxWhen in Lombok & budget allowed, dont miss QUNCI VILLA. We will surely come back."

There is a book on the art in the resort in every room which is a wonderful story. The rooms are spacious but need a little extra cleaning to get stains out of the floors. We had a pool villa which was private and a treat. We ate breakfast and dinner on the beach - delicious food and great service. The staff treated us like family.

","Slick and Stylish Hotel","Qunci Villas offers comfortable, stylish accommodation in a stunning coastal location. Much thought has gone into incorporating interesting furniture and artefacts to enhance the ambience of the hotel. Upper floor rooms offer the most privacy as paths pass close to the windows and terraces of lower floor rooms.The three large pools ensure that there is plenty of room for guests to swim and sunbathe without feeling too overcrowded.We ate in the Quali restaurant several times and found the food there to be well presented and delicious.The reasons for not giving this hotel 5* are the sum of several small details, namely:A lack of communication to guests about special events taking place, we were not informed of the hotel barbecue or night market. There was no shower gel or body lotion provided (normal in any 4* hotel) the soap lay in a puddle of water all week! Our local tour company faxed the hotel giving our pick up time but this information was not passed to us and we had to e-mail the company ourselves.Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our 7 night stay at Qunci Villas, in early November, but these small points just made it fall short of perfect."

We stayed in room 9, which does need a makeover as it is a bit ""tired"", but no problem with insects or noise.Food and drink very good, choice for breakfast was a bit limited (mainly with some kind of egg dish).The staff are very, very friendly, eager and willing to help, some of the nicest people I've met. A bit more training on how to serve food and drinks would make them excellent (sometimes we got the cocktails with the wine and main course, together with the starter), this is a management task and should not detract from the staff in the restaurants.Some loud hawkers on the beach who would not leave you alone, but it is a public beach."

","As good as ever","We stayed at Qunci for the second time and it is still an outstanding resort. We had an Ocean View room and spent almost the entire 4 days in the resort. The location, food, drink and service was simply too good to leave. The service was of the highest standard anywhere we have stayed. Better than some of the famous European hotels. We had a small request when we checked in late in the evening and they said they couldnât fulfil my request that night but they would pass it to the morning shift. I thought I bet I never hear from them again but to my surprise the Customer Relation Manager found us at breakfast and informed us they could meet our request that day. I told him that was great customer service and his reply was âthat is my job sirâ. We were very impressed. All the staff are simply there to help you in whatever you needed. My wife had a birthday and they presented her with a beautiful chocolate mud cake with much fanfare at dinner â no charge. We nibbled on the cake over the entire stay. Donât hesitate to have a holiday here in whatever room category you wish. The Ocean view rooms are nice but you donât really spend that much time in your room. There are a huge number of seats around the 3 pools so there is no need to reserve seats and all of that hassle. Although the resort was supposedly full there never seemed to be many people. It is just a very well-run resort. Well done and we will be back again and again."

","Awesome Anniversary","What an amazing place to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. To describe the Qunci experience in one word it would be "" Perfection"". From the moment we arrived, the room as I requested it had I frangipani love heart on the bed with additional flowers in the room and was absolutely perfect. The inspiring decor, furniture and art work blends so well with the superbly manicured gardens all adds to the great feel of this place. We loved the stylish outdoor bathroom experience. The smiling friendly staff is one of the biggest assets to this resort. No matter what their position the staff smile and pleasantly greet you every time and will action every request promptly. On the night of our wedding anniversary we had the ""Romantic Dinner"" a beautiful 5 course dinner in a stunning prepared private gazebo with white drapes, flowers, candles, amazing views and a private waiter. Through no fault of Qunci during our very tasty romantic dinner the heavens opened up and it rained very heavily and we decided to sit and stay in the romantic gazebo. We had to instruct the waiter to get out of the rain as he was still standing there waiting to serve us !! After he got the message he hurried back and stood there with an umbrella. The rain got worse and he then assisted us out of the rain soaked gazebo and into the restaurant for coffee and desert, that is an example of service you don't find in too many places.......!! To the owner Scott, Wow you have built the most amazing resort with most amazing people managing it !! It is a credit to you. We would highly recommend Qunci for a romantic get away or to anyone celebrating a memorable occasion! Thanks Michael and Kym"

","One of the best resorts Iâve stayed","We stayed 4 nights in Garden View room in Quinci Villas resort. It was very relaxing experience. Our room had good location next to the spa and even though it was ground floor it didnât feel like being up front when hanging out on the terrace (some of the sea view rooms close to the pools might have that problem). The decoration in the room and all over the resort is very stylish. Where ever you look you can find a piece of art. Although our outdoor bathroom didnât look like the green oasis presented in the gallery at Quinci websites but it was more like the one in the pictures of a sea view or partial sea view rooms. Ours was nicely specious compared to another garden view roomâs bathroom that we saw (when we were allowed to take a shower after checking out). And we didnât have any problems with bugs.We really enjoyed the option to order breakfast to your own terrace. Ordering was easy (you just left a request form in wooden basket to the table on your terrace in the evening) and you had the exact same breakfast menu to choose from as in the restaurants. For us the breakfast portion sizes were no problem.I encourage you to use Quamboja spa. It really is high-class and very pleasant experience. Definitely the best spa Iâve visited. We had a two hour spa treatment that included Balinese massage, body wrap and flower bath for USD 50 per person (+tax). I also had a 30 min hair treatment USD 15 (+tax) which I recommend if you have long and thick hair. It really makes difference. Comparing the prices to resort spas in Seminyak Bali Iâd consider them competitive.Service at the resort was impeccable, thoughtful and very friendly. All the problems (like lost phoneâ¦) or requests (separate duvets for double bed, cooler & champagne classes) were solved and fulfilled. Resort is very clean and that way completely opposite to what you see outside. I donât even try to explain how perfect the resort looked â just check the pictures on their website or other reviews in TA. All in all I would say that stay at Quinci is well worth the value and more. Iâd be happy to go back anytime and would highly recommend it to anybody searching a perfect place to relax. Just couple of things Iâd like to change in Quinci (as I know they really are reading these reviews). A quick fix would be changing decent (meaning more powerful) hair dryers to rooms. The second and more meaningful change would be the food at the restaurants. It feels like it has been modified to please âwestern paletteâ and gone way too shy. Even the dishes marked with chili are completely lacking heat. Travelling to an island named chili youâd expect to find stronger tastes. Maybe at least some sambal could be available at the tables? Only time we got food that tasted authentic spicy Asian was when we participated A Thai Experience at NooQ bar (luckily the girl serving at NooQ recommended it to us otherwise we wouldnât have even known such event â also thanks to the same girl recommending us very tasty mango coladas at happy 2 hours!) and we were asked how spicy we prefer our food. If you want to have tasty dinner outside the resort try Square. They have pick-up and drop-off service.Unfortunately I donât think Quinci can do anything to the hawkers on the beach right next to the pools. Itâs a shame that you cannot just enjoy the spectacular view by the pool without someone trying to sell you something. It also means that no guests want to use the sun beds closest to the beach (except the older ladies desperately seeking attention of young local guysâ¦).I have to mention also that arriving Lombok airport isnât the most flattering experience. Inside the terminal there are two taxi stands offering transportation. Fixed price to Quinci is 195k rupiah on a regular taxi that doesnât have air conditioning and smells a bit odd. Metered taxi costs about the same but you pay directly to the driver. The ride takes about 75-90 minutes and youâll see some heartbreaking poverty on the way. Indonesian traffic is maniac. For the return trip we decided to use Quinci driver and car (has A/C), costs USD 30 (+tax). As we had plenty of time before our flight the driver showed us a pretty mosque, rice fields and took us to a village where they weave textile by hands (if you go be prepared to be pressured to buy like usually in places like this).A word of advice if you want to visit Gili Islands. First of all you have two options if you want to go a Quinci arranged trip â you can either take a boat the whole way (should take 45min â 1 hour) or you can take a taxi and ride 25mins to a speedboat harbor and take a speedboat 10mins to Gili Trawangan. As it was raining the morning of our trip we were only offered the option taxi+speedboat which suit us well. Receptionist called a boatman (900k rupiah for 2 persons return trip to Gili T) and also a taxi. Taxi costs 60-70k rupiah to the harbor. All the arrangements went smoothly to the point we landed back to Lombok. The boatman did not call the taxi he should have but left for another boat ride and instead asked a guy at the harbor to call us a taxi. He offered to ride us to Quinci for triple price compared to taxi. We kindly asked him to call a taxi we were promised. We waited at the very rural harbor (=sandy beach) where chickens are running around free. After maybe 15 minutes of waiting the guy came to us again and said that he had called a taxi but seems like itâs not coming and offered again the triple price ride (like it was our only option). At that point I figured he never called any taxi and after that we definitely did not want to step in to his car. So luckily I had Quinci number and called them if they could get us a taxi. The problem was that the harbor had no sign saying the name of it and at the reception they didnât know where we had been sent that morning. The receptionist suggested two names and I guessed right one cause after 10 minutes a taxi arrived. The guy offering triple price ride tried to stop us walking towards the taxi an insisted we had to wait under a shelter (where the taxi driver would never have seen us). So if you go for a trip to Gilis by speedboat make sure you have phone number for a taxi and ask the taxi driver dropping you off to tell you the name of the harbor."

","Best villa ever!!!","This is the perfect villa that everyone is dreaming of. Quite, beautiful, very clean, organize, peaceful, relaxing, friendly staff, super nice spa (try Qamboja Special). They have three infinity pools that are lovely and clean. Tables and benches besides that pool are also nice and comfortable. Food is good especially the free breakfast. Villas don't have TV as u can really relax for your whole stay. Toilet and shower area are stunning. I just don't like the vendors outside the beach, keep forcing you to buy things from them even though u already bought and say that u can't buy anymore they will still insist that you need to buy.Overall stay is perfect! I will definitely come back at Qunci as they gave me my perfect holiday experience! ^^"

","Awesome stay in Qunci Villas","We had a great stay at Qunci Villas from 22nd - 25th November 2013. Services and accommodation are at its best. Qunci Villas is built facing the sea. So when having your breakfast, lunch or dinner, you may want to sit near the sea to have a romantic meal with your love ones. The staffs are friendly and helpful in all ways. We also had a couple massage for 3 hrs, that the massage is so relaxing and awesome. I love the milk bath and the facial the most. It really helps to clean of my dirt on my body and face."

","Unforgettable","We had the good fortune recently to stay at Quinci Villas and found the service and accommodation impeccable. Photos of the sun setting over the lap pool and beach just don't capture how gobsmackingly gorgeous this place is. We enjoyed cocktail hour most nights, sampling the local flavours with a twist, before dining at either of the two retaurants which we can highly recommend. Don't miss lunch hour either - my favorite was the salad nicoise with fresh, locally caught tuna. High praise must also go to the staff running and working at Quinci, what a delight to be met with smiling faces and an attitude to match."

","Spacious, Sluded and Special","Hello,We had the fortune to spend 5 nights in Villa Quanang.Quanang Villa is one of 3 exclusive villas which are operated by Quinci Villas Hotel and are situated up a quaint country lane ,overlooking the Hotel , lush greenery and the sea. The Villa is a short 5 minutes walk downhill from the main Hotel area.during the walk we would see villagers doing their daily chores, roaming cows,goats and of course chickens and roosters. Going back from the resort we had the availability of a Quinci driver and car , which we used most f the time. It was very hot to walk during our stay, but we considered the walk to and from the villa and resort, to be an easy one .Taxis to Sengiggi were very inexpensive ($2 aud) and would come up to the Villa to pick us up. Our Butler would make he booking for us.Quanang Villa is a large 2 bedroom Villa, each with a beautiful bathroom , which has an outside shower. Really good shampoos, conditioners, razors were supplied.The bedroom was large, had a small sitting area and king size beds. Linen was also top quality.The living areas of the Villa were vast, with traditional Lombok furniture and artifacts. The downstairs area flowed onto a large timber deck and our own private pool. Views from this level and upstairs were fantastic.Our Butler service was certainly a highlight of Villa Quanang. Not once did they not open the front door for us when we returned from our excursions around the area. We did not see the staff clean our rooms or the Villa as this was done when we were out of the Villa. This we thought, was a wonderful touch .Drinks were served, coffee made and snacks bought out to us. We did find little shops around the area where to buy our supplies.Breakfast was cooked by a chef who came up from the main resort, and served by our Butler. The breakfast was superb. Eggs Benedict every morning of our stay was just heaven!.Fresh mixed juice,fresh fruit, and wonderful coffee were always supplied for breakfast.The only shortcoming with our stay there was the noise which came from the 2 nearby Mosques. From as early as 4.30 AM, the call to prayer was heard. We were offered ear plugs upon our arrival and in retrospect we should have used them.Another minor negative was the lack of suitable steps to enter and exit the pool. Younger people would not find this an issue.We really enjoyed our time in Lombok and at Villa Quanang at Quinci Villas. The resort itself is beautiful, staff very friendly and attentive.We thought that Quanang Villa was good value for 2 couples sharing and we enjoyed its seclusionWould highly recommend a stay at Quinci in any of their accommodations offered.RegardsRSA"

","Perfect Beachfront","In our search for something other than Bali, we fell in love with Lombok and Qunci was the perfect beach getaway! The resort is beautifully landscaped with one of the best beachfront I've seen. The beckoning waves are literally just a step in front of the resort so it felt like your own private stretch of beach. Very clean and water is crystal. Only downside is the shallow corals, made wading out quite treacherous without aqua gear.But the infinity pools are wonderful to laze in although the depth is unusually deep; 1.6m (we travelled with kids so not great for them). Still the whole resort is catered perfectly for chilling out, relaxing to the sound of the sea and enjoying beach massage at only USD10! There are 2 restaurants with very decent food. In fact, we had some of our best meals within Qunci, so in effect you didn't even really have to head out if you didn't want to. The restaurants in the town centre are quite mediocre. Maybe only Square Restaurant was worth the ride out.Having said that, I did have a bit of problems with the Venus Clam spaghetti they served. I should have known something was amiss as it didn't smell quite right. But too late... unfortunately I ended up with the runs after that dinner. Still I wouldn't take credit away from the standard of F&B. My general advise is in places like Indonesia, it's best not to take a chance on shellfish (biofeeders). We stayed in 2 different Oceanview rooms and had friends in the upper floor ones as well. Verdict: go for Room 23 (upper floor) or Room 58 - it had an amazingly huge bathroom! Lovely outdoor shower. Room 27 was not so great - it was relatively smaller and looked somewhat tired and the bathroom had a strange odour. Overall, I would recommend Qunci over any other in the Sengiggi area!"

","Would love to live there!","We went to Quincy for 14 days. Our large group included my parents (70+) my brother and wife and their baby as well as our baby and toddler. There is not much to fault and we all thought Qunci was outstanding. The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff was exceptional. I was up to a good start as I forgot one bag at the airport - their organised its return, which took about 45 minutes, several phone calls and a lot of waiting - thank you again for the great effort! The grounds are well looked after and beautiful. Some people complain about the chanting, I believe if you travel to a muslim country you should expect it. I also found it at times quiet interesting. We didn't see it as a problem (the baby caused a lot more sleeplessness). Breakfast was tasty and it was no trouble to order a couple if you felt like it ... The three restaurants are all good, even though I would not call them exceptional. We actually found the lunch menu a little more inspiring than the dinner menus and thought that there could be maybe some more local variety on the dinner menu as well (but I assume a lot of people are conservative in their eating style). Spicy didn't really mean spicy but I could have proabbly ask for more chili...Again, when help was needed the staff was there for us. For all concerned mothers, the hospital 25 min away is very clean and good as we experienced... The feel of the whole resort is beautiful and relaxing. Nothing to complain about our room, spacious, little bar fridge, nice verandah. Our villas (71,73) were quiet open with a bit of foot traffic, which didn't worry me, but could bother others who want more privacy. Not many people did it, but if you like snorkelling I can highly recommend to give it a go there. It might not be the Great Barrier Reef or one of the Islands nearby, but we saw a couple of turtles and a lot of colourful fish, probably best to go in the southern direction but it is worthwhile anywhere. Nice exercise after breakfast! There is also a little restaurant behind the Quncy bar that we visited a few times for lunch, we all stayed healthy and enjoyed the local food. They showed us the fish and they looked beautiful and fresh. Happy hour with view of the volcano was always a nice event, sunset, G&T - magnificent. Overall, a beautiful resort, great service and wonderful people. A couple of things could be different (maybe a chance to open a window and have flyscreens for night time so one doesn't have to blow the aircon, a little more information on tours and trips but I also didn't investigate a lot). That is pretty much it. It is not a resort for kids, but it is kid friendly and it really is - the staff was so great with all three of them and we just told our toddler to keep it down when he got too excited. But there were no complaints and I think people were too relaxed anyhow to worry about the occasional noise. Enough now, as I also don't want that Quncy becomes too popular so we can get a room next time for a similar price! I heard just recently they won the Best Resort in Indonesia and I can understand why. It was not just the luxury, it was probably more so the casual, friendly and familiar feeling we experienced for 14 days which makes this resort exceptional. It just works. Thank you again to all the staff from Mr Philipp!"

","Wish we bought a surf board","Great little learners wave right out front and a nice left hander a short walk and a decent paddle up the beach. Rooms are big and comfortable, with a turn down service each night and mosquito treatment. We are staying in a partial ocean view room, with it's own balcony, free wifi but no tv so stock up on ibooks and movies if you need the distraction. Food is great, including a decent breakfast selection, which can be served in your room if you wish. Good location, we've hired a scooter to run around on, a trip into town takes around 5 minutes. 3 infinity pools and heaps of sun lounges means we haven't had to fight anyone for a seat.Now back to relaxing"

","An amazing, well thought out paradise","Qunci villas is an amazing slice of paradise. The ambiance is fantastic, so great in fact that we decided to forgo our activities and camp out at the resort - which I never do.The layout of the hotel is amazing and takes every advantage of their wonderful beachfront location. The staff is impeccably trained. The well thought out ambiance can just not be beat!A few minor caveats dropped it one star: food inconsistency, room inconsistency and the most insane laundry bill ever. However, this is one of my favorite hotels I have ever been to- so highly recommended - just don't use the hotel laundry service!Pools: three infinity pools and more than enough chairs for everyone and a great staff to bring you drinks and food by the pool. Rooms: top floor ocean view room is what you want: top floor for privacy and ocean view for the view :) room 55 was perfection for us. We also got a chance to stay in a one bedroom pool villa and didn't love it. The bathroom was not quite outdoors and the rooms are close to the road which spoils the ambiance a bit, but probably worth while if you are honeymooning for the privacy of your own yard and pool. However, we loved the outdoor shower and great view from room 55.Restaurants:Great ambiance and depending on what you order, great food. Sometimes food was inconsistent. A soggy bahn mi, an indelibly salty miso soup- but absolutely amazing breakfast and the best green curry I have ever had. Made from scratch ginger tea! Generally everything is great, but you might get an occasional dud. Spa:Clean, super upscale experience and trained wonderful staff. Lemongrass drinks and cool towels during check in- tea after, amazing massages here! And again, super ambiance. The only major disappointment was our laundry bill. I allow for the idea that the hotel should charge more, but our bill was totally crazy- 85$ US for what amounted to maybe two small loads of laundry mostly consisting of small items- socks, underwear, tank tops etc. We had laundry done in bali at our nice hotel for 1/4 the price. The average salary on lombok is like 10-15$ a day and there are local options at a fraction of the cost (which we learned later). ... To charge 85$ for laundry is simply put- unacceptable. So just beware. Overall:A most amazing hotel where you will love your stay and see some of the most beautiful sunsets of your life. Just don't do your laundry here."

","Great but disappointing at the same time.","Loved the deck area around the infinity pools and not being hassled by too many hawkers but found the food incredibly disappointing.I paid for a romantic dinner and the food was terrible which made the entire experience an overpriced waste of time. One of the appetizers was an insipid, uninspiring chewy chicken meat ball in broth. The only good thing about the dish was the broth.I'm not really sure what my entree was supposed to be but the beef was like chewing old boot leather. I had to send my steak back as it was blue instead of medium. When it was returned, my veggies were cold and my fiancÃ© had finished his meal. In all, the romantic dinner was a colossal waste of money. Whist the room was spacious, having a thatched roof meant an unexpected and unwelcome wake up call at 4.15 every morning. The two mosques nearby commence the call to prayer at this time. A great way to ruin a holiday. Request a room on the ground floor. The staff at breakfast were very attentive but that's where the attentiveness ended. Getting service for lunch or dinner was pretty tough."

Long walks on the beach are also highly recommended. If you are anywhere near Singgigi, stay at this lovely hotel!"

","A perfect sweet escape !","This was the first time I stayed at Qunci Villas, the room was superb, excellent. We love our room facing to the sea by the infinity pool. The sea view was breathtaking. We stayed for 2 nights, though it was a short trip to Lombok but Qunci has given us a perfect getaway. A perfect place for honeymooners since Qunci has its own beach, just enjoy a whole day on the villas and you won't get bored! Breakfast was tasty, smart service by providing breakfast on ala carte instead of buffet on this type of property. Egg Benedict was worth to try. We really love breakfast by the sea, really beautiful view while enjoying your meal.The interior was simple but look nice with the ambience. Overall it was a perfect stay at Qunci. Oia, it has no TV in the room, but we wont need it anyway, just enjoy the time and relax on the pool chair. Its totally an escape from hectic world, very authentic leisure.Hopefully we could come back soon at Qunci when we visit Lombok. Thanks to my sister who gave this perfect honeymoon gift. Thanks to Qunci for the totally sweet getaway !"

","Best Lombok Accommodation","have stayed at Qunci at least once a year since 2008 and will keep returning as not only is it the best place to stay on this delightful island (and we have stayed at the most expensive), it offers very good value for money. The staff, food, rooms, landscaping are of high quality and there is a high level of staff retention which is a mark of a well managed establishment. Sat on your terrace as the sun sets over Bali and the deliciously refreshing pool whilst drinking a cold Bintang is one of life's delights"

","paradise...","This is probably the nicest beachhotel i have been to in my life. pickup at the airport worked well, the transfer is now almost 90 minutes, with the new airport in the south of lombok. On arrival we had the bad news, that the reservations had not been able since june to limit the moves between rooms ( i guess they simply forgot - so : send them reminders if this occurs to you) . The good news - this stayed the only flaw, and gave us the chance to see three categories: oceanview, sideview, private villa)Rooms: All rooms visited were modern, clean, beautifully furnished, with nice peaces of art. Size differences are marginal, the openair bathrooms were bigger when groundfloor). Aircondition blew onto the bed - so we put it off ( no problem for us, for others might be). The villa had some extras bathrobes, coffeemachine etc. Disadvantage of the villa is, that they are very near to the street, so you hear that much more than in the other rooms. Pool/Beach: 3 infinity pools, on a guessed 2o m long on a coast with white sands and situated with a view of a sunset in front of balis coast... beautiful. pool services excellent, water and fruit skewers provided , towels nicely setup with flowers, Premises : beautiful. decorated wirh artworks, constant pickup of leaves etc. as said ... flawless. There is constant attention of the many staff , constantly around. All very very friendly, which like so often in Indonesia easily compensates the sometimes not so high level of professionality. That said - here was a good level of education.This is a phantastic hotel, go there if you have the chance. you will not regret this"

","we loved it","Spent our last 2 nights here and arrived from gilli t around 10am so had the morning around the pool until our room was ready. We were given the ground floor beachfront room right opposite the massage hut which was lovely although the privacy during the day is limited with the massage ladies in front and the long lines of deck chairs only a few metres to your right.By day 2 we were used to this and claimed a couple of the deck chairs closest as ours and thought that the proximity to the ocean and views more than made up for the lack of privacy especially in the evening and early morning. The room above would have been perfect. Lovely pools, lovely food, lovely beach- good for a swim and a walk. .A great warung up the beach to the right run by a family.( We didnt get to walk left.) The spa is one of my all time favourites, beautiful decor and excellent treatments. Not cheap but soo nice. The morning specials are a good deal or the massage hut ladies are right there. Quite a big property, very well maintained with excellent staff and so pretty at night with candles and lighting although during the day the long lines of deck chairs create to me a more- am i here or in Phuket feel.Also, my husband likes talking to people and went off to look for a bar( which i think is really a small restaurant area.) We had happy hour there on our last night and chatted to an american couple who were looking for a social place also - would be great if this area was more recognizeable as a bar or a social area. Overall we loved it here , i wish we could have stayed longer and will definately come back hopefully in june if not sooner."

","Cannot Fault","Everything we requested in our booking request was met without exception, from our collection at the airport by their friendly driver, to the room we requested. Qunci is elegant in its simplicity of design, both inside and out. The biggest Qunci asset is their staff ...they are amazing. I have to admit I am totally hopeless at names, but even if I could remember them, in this instance it would make no difference as all staff were excellent and I could not single out even a couple of them. It didn't matter whether their work was on the front desk, in a restaurant, groundstaff, maintenance or at the spa ..., they all went out of their way to smile and assist you with nothing but friendly professionalism. We stayed in a ground floor ocean view room, loved the verandah and the view. Will admit that my very first impression of room was that it was more simple than expected and couldn't help feeling that maybe it was very open to all at the pool or nearby restaurant, that feeling however lasted about 10 minutes! I quickly realised the location to be perfect, and in walking around the resort, I really don't think you could choose a bad room type. The infinity pools are beautifully clean and great temp, the restaurants (favourite being Quah) are affordable with great food and drink prices compared to a lot of Bali resorts, you really dont have to dine out if you dont wish. The friendly beach ware sellers and massage ladies are great to talk to and fun people, none of whom are pushy, they know when you might be interested and when you are not, they too are professionals ! If you want a Tv in your room, if you want to make your own tea and coffee in room or anything else ...just ask. Other stuff: We booked a trip to Gilli Islands through the resort, listened to their advice on how best to undertake this and didn't regret it all. Snorkelling at Gilli Meno is awesome. Happy two hours also great. Thank you Qunci, you gave us a beautiful holiday to remember."

","Best hotel i have stayed in","Hi,We have not long returned from honeymoon.4 days in Bali and 9 in Lombok.Thgis hotel is absolutely stunning.Brilliant location directly on the beach,3 infinity pools and excelltent service.The hotel is immaculate,the staff work so hard to keep it clean and al were very friendly.We did not have one bad meal,all was lovely presented and tasted gorgeous.The hotel is as stunning as on the website.It was the personal touches which I valued.When they turned down your bed at night there was always fresh fowers scattered.You would get fresh fruit wrapped in banana leaves,small things like that went a long way.The only thing I will say is Lombok apparently is a high risk of malaria so make sure you get your tablets.Neither of us got bit but we did take precautions.They do a 'fogging' at the hotel every Monday to kill the mosquitos.I would recommend this hotel to anyone on homeymoon,i would say its definitely a adult hotel,children very welcome but the setting is more suited to adults I think."

","Wonderful!","Qunciâ¦ was just fabulous! My boyfriend and I stayed for 8 nights at the Qunci in early October and it was just wonderful. A lot of people seem to spend only a few nights here going between Bali and Gilis but we could have happily stayed longer than 8 nights! Just a little about getting to Qunci from Bali: We pre-booked a ferry from Bali with Blue Water Express. They collected us from our hotel in Seminyak and dropped us off at the port, Serangan. They contacted our hotel the night before leaving to reconfirm our booking and they arrived on time to collect us in the morning. The boat stopped off at Padang Bai where I believe people staying around Ubud got on. All in all it took around 2.30 hours to get to Teluk Kode in Lombok (and then it goes onto Gili T). We sat on the top of the boat â we got a little wet but the dolphin watching and scenery was worthwhile! They do not organise transfers in Lombok, but on the return leg they dropped us back off at our Bali hotel which is part of the overall cost. When booking with Blue Water Express, they initially raised the invoice in US$, I asked them to re-invoice in Euro which worked out far more cost effective for us (iro Â£70 per person return). When we got to Lombok it was approx. 20/25 in a cab to Qunci (a taxi should cost 65k / 100k IR versus the 250k IR the guy was insisting we paid).So back to Qunciâ¦ on arrival we were greeted with a lovey drink and cold towel and we checked in by Nova, who was uber helpful (throughout our entire stay) and has excellent English. Our room wasnât ready and so we headed to the pool / beach area â after a few hectic days in Seminyak, Lombok felt a million miles away, so chilled and serene. Nova came and found us when our room was ready opposed to us badgering for our room. We had paid for a garden room and expected to be on the ground floor but actually had a room on the first floor with a slight view of the sea and mountains. We spent most of the day by the pool and staring at the beach view, so an upgrade wasnât really necessary for us (worth it is you like being in your room during the day or staying for a special occasion). The room was great, the super king bed was heavenly and I loved the semi outside shower. There is a fridge (which we stocked up from the local mini marts and there seemed to be a little shop opp the hotel too) and a safe. I felt as though Qunci wants to be the best possible 4* hotel opposed to an average 5*resort, hence the lack of dressing gown and slippers, bose docking system that you may associate with 5*etcâ¦ and those add-ons arenât necessary hereâ¦ it is great just the way it is! Our room was cleaned every day and they have a turned down service each night and sprayed our room for mosquitos (we didnât have any problems with mossies at all whilst in Lombok). A few people mention the praying/chanting from the local mosque in the early hours of the morning... I sleep with ear plugs and did stir on a couple of occasions but on the whole it was fine. I am a foodie and Qunciâs two main restaurants were fabulous. We had breakfast on the beach each morning, lunch at either restaurants (they have the same lunch menu) and then varied between both restaurants as well as dining on the beach. We also went into town (Square / Quake) and ate on the beach (Warang Pardiso which is two minutes along the beach front - was ok food) to break it up. The food at Qunci was excellent and the portion sizes were good (sometimes large enough to share) and everything was fresh. For my first lunch I ordered the tuna salad â in some resorts you could end up with tinned tuna and canned veg, but this was seared tuna steak, olives, anchovies, quails eggs, capers, green beans etcâ¦ fresh and tasty. We enjoyed all our meals at Qunci and the staff added to this, they are friendly chatty and helpful, they fall over themselves to help you. We loved breakfast, starting with the fruit and fresh juices and we also order more than one dish each and they are happy to divert away from the menu too â just ask. The have themed nights and we did go to the BBQ night and had amazing fresh tuna, but I am not sure it was worth the money and sticking to their current a la carte was better value. Ayu, was our favourite waitress, she was uber friendly and on our first night told us that if you order a bottle of wine you can keep it in their fridge so you donât have to order by glass (they pour small glasses.. ), so we did that quite a few times and enjoyed it during sun downers / other dinners etc. The view of the beach was stunning and we didnât tire looking at it (or talking 100 photos of the view and sunset each night), however, the sea was too rocky for us to get into so it is worth taking jelly-type shoes. This was a real shame but we made do with the two 30ml pools. The pool area (actually the whole resort especially the gardens) is well looked after and they provide fresh towels. They bring you ice water and fruit on stick which is a lovely gesture. On a few occasions I went to get more water but I was always ushered back to my sun lounger as they wanted to bring it back to me (I partly felt bad as I was capable of carrying my own drinks but the staff see it as their job remit so you donât actually want to offend â it is quite nice to be waited on). Everyone staying at Qunci is there to relax / have a nice time and so there is a common respect for each other â no one hogged the sun loungers, took over the pool with floats or were ridiculously loud etc â it was very pleasant and safe environment. As for the hawkers, we ate mango/pineapple, bought bowls/sarongs, had a couple of massagesâ¦ so although it seems annoying to have people pester you we actually took up what they were offering (albeit not every day). If you donât want to engage just smile and say no thank you. They will not come on to the grounds so you can happily ignore them if you choose. There is a little market in town (Â£1 in a cab) and they sell the same things as the hawkers â bowls, Bingtang t shirts etc so they have more choice but still you will need to haggle. I didnât use the spa facility but had two massages on the beach, which I believe is actually part of Qunci and for 60 minute body massage it was Â£5â¦ perfect! When we arrived we were told we could book a Gilis tour the night before we wanted to go â they apparently use the fishing boats that are on the beach front (so you could probably negotiate a better deal directly with the boat men). However, when we wanted to go we were told it was not possible as the sea was too rough, which was hugely disappointing and something we hadnât really considered bearing in mind how close by the Gilis are. However, Nova came to the rescue with a Plan B and we ended up going on a day trip to Gili Nanngu which is South West of Lombok and very quiet and undiscovered compared to Gili T/Air/Meno. All in all Lombok and Qunci was fabulousâ¦ we were apprehensive about going in October as some forums say it is the start of the rainy season. The weather was amazing especially as there was a slight breeze which meant sitting out in 30+ was still very pleasant. Just as we were leaving the first part of the rainy season kicked in and there was heavy rain for one afternoon but the next day was exceptionally hot. So I would still recommend early October as a time to go. The Qunci was incredible value for money, great food, relaxing with wonderful staffâ¦sad to be home!"

After our trek there was muddle with our pick up by another hotel and the Qunci Villas reception staff were so kind and helpful making calls for us providing drinks despite the fact we looked like tramps after the trek.The service has to be the best ever !"

","Best vacation ever!","Just got back from our 7 days honeymoon at Qunci Villas. You have to experience it to believe it, the breathtaking sunset, friendly staffs, clean and spacious rooms (minimalist concept), comfortable beds, infinity pool, beautiful little touches, delicious meals, best ever spa experience, and the list goes on. Very impressed with the service offered by the staffs here, especially Gatot, Ferby, Putri and Aziz who has been very accommodating, helpful and pleasant!We were so comfortable staying back in the hotel for the whole 7 days that we didnt want to leave for any Gili (Island). My husband and i just chilled by the beach, people watching, reading books and enjoying the sun set as well as sea breeze. The owner has done an absolutely wonderful job, please keep it up! For those who are looking for a place to stay in Lombok, just book it as the rooms get taken up pretty quickly! Some beautiful pictures i would like to share...For those flying into Lombok, suggest you arrange with the hotel for their airport pick up although its a bit more pricey than flagging down a cab, it saves you the hassle and gives you a really wonderful start to your stay here.This place absolutely tops my favourite list and will definitely be coming back again, planning a longer stay perhaps 2 weeks. Hopefully soon if we win the Instagram Contest! :)"

","Idyllic Indonesian getaway","We stayed in a partial ocean view room for four nights. The attention to detail and quality of device were second to none. From bringing me paracetamol for a headache on my first morning to the complimentary fruit skewers on the afternoon, Quinci knows how to make guests feel relaxes and comfortable. We loved the accessibility to the beach and the beautiful sunsets every night. The food is not on the cheap side but the quality and service make up for the slight increase. This hotel is perfect for those looking to relax poolside or adventuring into the countryside or snorkelling in the Gilli Islands. We definitely plan on returning to Quinci."

","Book it - Your Search is Done!","The superior customer experience started the moment we transferred from Gili T to Lombok and arrived at the private harbour to have Qunci staff member, Ryan, pick us up and graciously drive us 10 minutes up the road to Qunci Villas. Upon checking in, our advance room request was honoured, we were provided a cold drink and cloth to cool off with, and Nova kindly chatted with us as he showed us our stunning Ocean View Room (#55). The grounds, landscape and design of Qunci is perfect for a beautiful environment of Lombok and for a classic yet modern Indonesian stay. In addition to the obvious care in how Qunci was designed, it's the little things and the staff that really make guests feel taken care of. After eating breakfast one morning overlooking the ocean, the restaurant manger came over to chat with us and make sure everything was good; a small but nice touch. At the pool each day, numerous staff would make sure you have towels, any food/drink you want, etc., and it is this great level of causal (in an Indo sense) yet attentiveness you get that makes the stay extra great. Food was great, location was just 5 minutes to central Sengiggi by taxi or motorbike, and there were great casual dinning options on either side of Qunci; try them both if you like good casual indonesian fare! Unlike much of Bali, or the Gili's, Lombok is very quite generally and even Sengiggi is pretty mellow, so don't come over thinking you're gonna party the night away. We loved Lombok for it's beauty, mellow vibe, authenticity, and lack of crowds. Sengiggi is also very close to the Gili's should you want to go there for a stay or just a day (I'd recommend it; we stayed several nights there for a good contrast). Besides, Qunci, we ate at Sasak Warung on the beach next to Qunci, Paradiso on the other side, and de Quake in town...all great and recommended!"

","The place to stay in Lombok","My husband and I stayed in a one bedroom pool room (Qenenga) for 5 nights in October. We loved every minute. The room was clean and spacious and expertly made up every morning with a turn down service each night. The beds are very firm, but comfortable. The pool was large, well maintained and the perfect temperature. The staff were friendly and helpful went out of their way to meet our every wish. The restaurants were lovely and everything we ate was delicious and reasonably priced. There was a great selection for breakfast which could be had overlooking the ocean or on the deck of our room. The real star of our trip was the days spa. We spent at least an hour and a half in it each day. All the treatments were amazing - a spiced bath following a massage and scrub is highly recommended!Walun (sp?) in the day spa gave the best massage of the trip and our driver (whose name escapes me) was terrific - great sense of humour and informative local stories.Qunci Villa's has taken a slice of paradise and turned it into heaven.We very much hope to be back next year."

","Gorgeous spa, but the resort could be everywhere","We stayed for 3 nights in this resort, 60 minutes driving in the night from Praya (IDR 225,000).They were helpful in getting our flight booked from Bali to Lombok, since I could not arrange that on-line with Lion's.The compound could be on every beach. Its seems as if Qunci prposefully does not like to reveal that it is located in Lombok. The resort is 5 years old we were told, so the trees are still in its infancy state. The rooms are nice, but again, a bit anonymous. Anyhow, the pictures on the site are made with special effects that we have not been able to find.And ... the devil is in the details: no replacement of fresh fruit, low on filling up the shampoos, sheets are changed around 16.00h etc.The staff is very friendly and well trained. There are 3 infinity pools, very well laid out along the small beach, a good place to watch the sun setting. The food is regular, more Thai/Viet than Indonesian. The boon, however, is the spa. Very reasonably priced (USD 30 + 21% VAT) as compared to other spa's, which make you come back. Expert ladies in a very stylish surrounding.In conclusion, 4 stars and don't try to get a fifth one."

","Absolutely top in every way! Amazing spot for a wedding!","We've been privileged enough to attend 2 weddings at Qunci Villas over the past 12 months and we couldn't possibly recommend it enough. From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave it's another world. The most incredible service you could imagine, beautiful, friendly, warm faces, nothing is ever too much for them. It's understated and graceful, attentive but also plenty of privacy. Rooms are quiet, beautifully furnished with an amazing outdoor showers, everything is taken care of and considered right down to the smallest touches. Beautiful beach front dining, watching the sun go down over the stunning pools as the world slows down, it's absolute paradise. A trip to the Gili's is a must whilst you're there! 10 out of 10!"

","closer to paradise","Stayed recently for 4 nights with another couple. Choose Qunci mainly from TA reviews & wasn't disappointed.Everything about this resort has a feel of understated quality & together with the superb setting & good service made for a very enjoyable and relaxing stay.we choose to stay in 2 partial ocean view rooms & initially had the upper & lower levels of one building - both had the best ""partial ocean views"" I have ever seen, however we were a bit concerned about the privacy of our lower level room, mainly due to the open shower & asked to move to another 2nd level room. The new room was a slightly different (but better) layout, was much lighter & still had the outside shower but everything felt much more private. However the ocean view was reduced to a fraction of the old room - this isn't a criticism really, we were very happy with our new room - but I want to point out that rooms here do have different levels of privacy & views. The staff however are excellent & will do their best to provide what you need to make your stay enjoyable.So - whats not to like about paradise? - well, nothing really. But I should point out that Qunci is too far to walk in to Sengiggi (but only a 5 minute drive), also that the beach in front has a rocky base.Everything else is perfect.We decided to ask for TV's in our rooms & found it good for news catch ups. The wifi was free, easy to access & available in all areas (great to use by the pool).Breakfast is not buffet but there is a good menu to order from & it is delivered quickly, plus you get to eat looking over the brilliant ocean every morning. The brazilian toast was my favorite & the bread baskets were always fresh.There is a great little beach bar that serves tasty food & the best cocktails at sunset. I really liked that the happy hour (5 to 7) included all the cocktails & allowed a flexable choice)But the absolute best part about qunci for me was the fabulous pools & comfy chairs all looking over the infinity pools to the ocean.There is a choice of 2 larger pools & one slightly smaller adults only pool next to the beach bar.The water of these pools is kept at a lovely refreshing temp & it was just the perfect spot to swim & relax all cares away. Despite a full resort there was never any problem with full lounges or pools & in fact most times we felt very exclusive lounging or swimming. towels are freely available & not restricted to silly towel cards. Staff even let us take a pool towel on a day trip to the islands.We also tried the 2 resort restaurants (something we rarely do) & both gave us excellent food & wine in a magical setting overlooking the flood lit water (so perfect for romance).We also tried the spa at the resort, the price was very resonable and all four of us felt that it was the best massage in many asian trips - would highly recommend a massage treatment here.I also cannot praise the staff enough - while many resorts seem to make it hard work to ask for anything, nothing was a problem for the staff here. They all seemed happy & it showed in their performance.We would all stay in qunci again & with direct flights from perth to Lombok soon - I can't wait."

","10/10 for 10 days","From the moment after check in, walking through the grounds we knew we had come somewhere special. We spent ten fabulous days at Qunci Villas in Villa number (7), closest to the adults only pool and bar. Everything was above our expectation. The staff were graceful and courteous but not intrusive. Nothing was a problem for them. On arrival I locked myself out of the in-room safe, they come and unlocked it straight away then walked back to bring me a power adaptor. We never run out of towels and the shampoo and conditioner were filled daily. Although the resort is not in Senggigi it's a short Taxi ride only costing AU$2. They also do airport transfers and its about an hour away.Qunci Villas is a very romantic place it seemed like ever couple thought they were the only two there, this is not surprising as this is how the staff made you feel.We took advantage of the facilities including, the spa where my wife had several enjoyable massages and a cooking class held by the executive chef. We highly recommend this as its a great price, you learn from the best and you get the food served up for lunch, enough for two.There are many special things about QV, happy hour, adults only pool, out door showers the list goes on. All I can suggest is you go there, you won't be disappointed."

","Another world","Qunci villas are everything you could want on a holiday in Paradise...The rooms are quietly elegant, cool, comfortable and a pleasure to be in.There is no tv which, while it would be nice to watch in the morning, is something you get used to not having and not missing., iThe bathrooms are open air and although it gets quite hot in there with the sun on your makeup, it is lovely to shower looking up at the tree with the pink flowers on and the palm trees gently swaying in the breeeze.The hotel is right on the beach and there aren't too many annoying hawkers that come along, I find to chat to them and maybe buy something quiet relaxing and they appreciate your attention I think.The food in both the Quali and the Quah restaurants is different and delicious, one side having Asian seafood and the other Meditteranean. Watching people swimming or just watching waves is an enjoyable thing to do waiting for your food.The staff stop at nothing to make your every whim become a reality, even down to how you like your coffee! amazing.You need to come here and spoil yourself.Sengiggi used to be closer to the Mataram airport and now the Praya one is 1 1/2 hours or thereabouts away but still worth the trip..."

","spoil yourself","We have just returned from our 5 night stay at quinci luxury villas. We stayed in the 2 bedroom villa on the hill-which enabled us to enjoy the facilities of the resort and the space/service of a private villa. The resort facilities were beautiful and the staff are outstanding -so lovely and helpful. We were a bit hesitant having private butlers but on meeting our two butlers(andi and eko) we were intantly put at ease. They provided first class service in a professional manner with out being intrusive.They made us feel that nothing was too much trouble and had such lovely caring natures. Lombok itself was a welcome relief after the noise and pollution of bali(much more laid back). I would definately recommend this villa/hotel and my sisters and I are already planning our return trip to this little piece of paradise."

","Paradise","We first visited Qunci Villas in September 2011 as we had chosen Qunci to host our destination wedding with 30 guests. Needless to say we loved it that much we returned in September 2012 and again this year in September.The Qunci staff on each visit were as friendly as ever, and itâs really great how many staff remembered us given the intervals between our stays.We have stayed in the 3 Bedroom Villa (Qusia) up the hill from the main Qunci hotel each visit, and couldnât imagine a more relaxing way to spend a week away from home. We have both travelled extensively and Lombok is our number one pick. Itâs paradise to us.The butlers Munzier and Budi were great, and couldnât have done a better job making us feel more comfortable for 7 nights.For day trips, do see the waterfalls and take a trip over to Gilli Meno or Gilli Air to snorkel with the sea turtles, itâs a great day.We spent a fair bit of time in the Qunci Day Spa, and will certainly recommend it to other future guests - professional, clean and well trained staff.The Qunci restaurants have improved significantly since our previous visit last year â a credit to the management, and we had no issues with any of the meals served. There was a good mix of Seafood, Mediterranean and Indonesia dishes. We had the chocolate Molten cake for dessert so many times that we just had to ask for the recipe!"

","Fantastic for honeymooners!","We stayed at Qunci Villas for 4 nights in early October 2013, in between our time in Sanur, Bali and Ubud, Bali. From the moment we stepped foot on the hotel grounds, we knew we were staying somewhere very special. Given that we were on our honeymoon, I reached out to the hotel staff beforehand, who made sure we had the best ocean view room possible on the grounds. They certainly delivered, and the staff consistently went out of their way to make sure we were having a great time. Nova at Qunci Villas really went out of his way to ensure our stay was as pleasant as possible, and helped us book both a day trip to the nearby Gili Islands and our return ""fast boat"" trip to Bali via Gili Cat (also highly recommended). Afif (hopefully I am spelling his name right) was very excellent in waiting on us during the romantic candllelit dinner that I booked for our honeymoon. The food was also consistently great at Qunci Villas, to the point where we only ate one meal away from the hotel. The spa is also worth mentioning; my wife and I got two massages each. The prices were very reasonable and the spa staff very good. We would highly suggest staying at Qunci Villas for those looking for some time away from the hustle and bustle of Bali. Lombok is an amazing island and is much quieter than Bali, which was perfect for us honeymooners. The views of the Lombok Strait from our hotel room were breathtaking, and the 2 for 1 happy hour was also a nice touch. Finally, the hotel does special dinner evenings on the beach for a nominal fee. The hotel was a good value and is actually priced cheaper than it should be. We will hopefully return to Lombok someday and we will definitely stay at Qunci Villas again! Qunci Villas was the highlight of our trip to Indonesia!"

The staff were so friendly and attentive, the food delicious and very reasonably priced, and the massages at the spa the best ever! The only tiny hiccup was the very early call to prayer from the mosque, but hey, as a visitor to their country, we can't complain.

","Picture perfect but very dense and crowded","Pros:- Sunset from the pool and restaurant is gorgeous and peaceful.- Facilities: very pleasant pools, picture perfect grounds, manucured gardens- Good money for value ratio- Really appreciated the night setting with dim lights all over the resort and candles. It was a real plus.- Dinner food was fabulous at the seafood restaurant: good choice, tasty, and very good quality.Cons:- Main con is the very very dense grounds. Villas are very close to each other, and to the walking paths, thus ending disrupting the privacy you would expect while on holidays, especially when staying on ground floor villas.- Very crowded and busy as it is a very popular destination. So do not expect to feel secluded at the beach, the restaurant, the pools...- Avoid Qima (2bedrooms villa) as the rooms are really dark, and the private pool is very cold being shadowy most of the day. There was also a broken tile on the pool floor and it hurted a lot when hitting it.- Be aware as there is no TV in the room for watching movies at night.- Very popular with french crowd (if it qualifies as a con)- Spa facilities is average and charmless. Price was fair though.- Breakfast food was average and a bit dull ( tried 3 different menus).- Staff was not as friendly and attentive as in other indonesia's similar hotels: probably because they have to serve so many guests, some lack passion (thumbs up though to the guest relation guy, can't remember his name but he's an exemple to follow for the others).Overall:The hotel is US owned so it does feel very professional and you feel that the guy knows his job.I am not sure I would recommend this hotel eventhough it has a good location, pleasant facilities and offer good value for money. But you should be aware that it is very popular, so very crowded all the times and because it is so compact, you can hardly find privacy in your room or day bed lounge."

","Where shall we begin with this one?","Just returned from 7 nights at Qunci staying in one of the pool villas (Qumbara) and what can I say except ""Stunning"". From the moment we arrived to the moment we left there were smiles and hard working staff attentive to your every need. We arrived in the late evening around 8.30pm after a flight down from Singapore so didn't really get to see the beauty of the resort as such until next morning.A swift check-in and we were off to our villa. The room had been prepared with flowers on the bed, orchids around the bed a really nice touch ( really funny when the orchid disappeared next day and they were placed in another villa) either which way the villa was excellent. I had noted from TA that TV's were available upon request so I had emailed in advance however no sign of it. A phone call to reception and within minutes an engineer arrived carrying a TV and stand. No issues here at all. I had however picked up the wrong adaptor for Indonesia, in my head it was 2 pronged flat plugs, in fact it was 2 prong rounds. Again not a problem the TV guy disappeared and returned with an adaptor in minutes. Brilliant. So by the time we had got ourselves sorted it was coming up to 10.00pm so we had a stroll around the resort and something to eat. We thought it may be a little late but no, the restaurants are open until 11.00pm so no worries even though we were the only people left in there. The food was superb and fantastically priced. So much so there really is no need to venture out of the hotel to eat if you don't want to. Unlike many other hotels where the food is overpriced.Breakfast as others have pointed out is an a-la-carte affair, a good selection and don't be afraid to order a couple of different things, We tended to have our main selection along with a Parisian basket which was really some pastries and bread with jam to share. Good strong Indonesian coffee and the day is off to great start. The resort has 3 great pools to chose from so always plenty of beds and towels, no need to reserve them here you wont have a problem, and the pools are cleaned and cleared of leaves constantly by the staff and great job by all. By 5.00pm when the sun is starting to fade a great time to try the buy one get one free cocktails. a vast array to chose from, so many cocktails so little time to try them all. A perfect end to the day and start to the evening watching the sun go down over Bali and Mt Agung in the distance. As I have mentioned dinner in either restaurant was top notch, the food was excellent and service impeccable. All in all a fantastic hotel and place to relax. Highly recommended and I know we will be back. I must however mention a couple of points to ensure a fair and balanced review and points I feel important to make. As I said we stayed in a pool villa (Qumbara) a beautifully appointed place and well worth the extra money every time. However please note it backs onto quite a noisy staff area, if you want an afternoon nap you may want to use earplugs as it can bet a little rowdy, Also as many have said the local mosque can be heard in the early morning so those ear plugs come in handy, but that said it is a predominantly Muslim country so deal with it, its not the end of the world and it is well documented that this happens. Also the pool villas are quite shaded with overhanging foliage so the pool does tend to be cold, well freezing actually, but then again a welcome rest bite from the sun. Not a show stopped but one to be aware of, we lost the sun after around noon so we went to the communal pools in the afternoon which did kind of contradict the point of paying for a private pool villa. Would any of these points stop me coming back? Not a chance. Qunci is a really gem in Indonesia. If you are thinking about booking it, don't think any longer, just do it you wont be disappointed I am sure"

","Beautiful place, great value for value for money - some considerations though","Qunci is very beautiful and having splurged at some expensive places - I thought you get huge value for money here. Its has many 5 star touches at much less than 5 star prices. I would agree that its not fantastic for families, its very adult oriented. HOWEVER, our family group with 4 kids under 7 still had a great time and the staff were very welcoming. They are so kind to the children, attending to their needs with warm smiles. Early dinners are a breeze. The pools are quite deep with no shallow end, its step step and you're in to 1.6m. Fine if you're a competent swimmer but our 5 year old could only hover on the steps. Rooms are tight fit for a family and there are no interconnecting rooms so you have to get a villa. There's a local school across the roads so any families that would like to give their pampered kids a dose of realism, guests can go over and play games which is great. Outings were tricky, its quite a drive to go to the sights for young kids. I'd suggest with a longer break that you stay at 2-3 locations near the major sights.The spa was FABULOUS and great value, I highly recommend their early bird package. Food was nice, not amazing but nice. Food service was sometimes slow, but hey, its Asia not Sydney, you're on holidays so best to just chill. We heard the mosque on the top level but not the bottom and we were far enough away to be able to fall asleep again.Guest services were very accommodating. My sister had trouble sleeping as a villa pool pump sound kept them awake in their room and they moved her that day. They also changed our move to an ocean view when we wanted to be close to the rest of our family.All in all, we had a really great time"

","Relaxing Place, Don't Recommend for Families","After reading some favorable reviews from others who travelled here with families I decided on the Qunci Villas as part of my first Lombok Trip. I also stayed at several other hotels in Lombok as I am expecting to return once every couple of years when visiting my wife's family. Out of the three, I would have to put Qunci at the bottom for families but the top for the honeymoon/couples group. For families: This place is really not ideal. You can certainly have a great time as others have, but there are vastly superior options out there. We had an 18 month old and even if a good bit older I would of think he would be bored and out of place here. Personally I think Qunci would benefit everyone by just making this place adults only. It would make this place that much more peaceful and force families to look at a better option.For couples: Excellent place for a romantic getaway. The resort is beautiful and the owner has clearly taken time to make this feel like a special place. First class service all the way around, never had any problems whatsoever.I do have a few suggestions, nothing deal breaking but I'd like to mention them since I know the owner reads these: -There was no in room menus for room service. You had to walk to the restaurants to get the menu or put in an order to get food delivered. Granted, most the time you'll want to eat in the restaurant with the excellent views but when its late/windy/raining having the menu right there in room already makes sense.-The coffee in the breakfast was extremely bitter and undrinkable, tasted like some cheap instant IndoCafe...maybe just the local flavor? The breakfast otherwise was excellent, really enjoyed the delivery in the morning.-The window shades left considerable gaps so that someone could see into your room quite easily with a place on the bottom floor. Not really ideal for most honeymooners I'd imagine.-A fitness center, even a limited one, would be great for longer stays. I enjoyed the Spa with massages from Dani and War but they would of been much better if it was after a good workout.Overall, excellent place if its just you and your significant other. I hope to re-visit when we get the chance to leave the little one with the grandparents :)"

","PARADISE","My husband and I stayed at Qunci Villas for three nights last month for the start of our honeymoon. We chose one of of the private pool villas. All I can say is.... we didn't want to leave! Qunci is really something special. The staff are so friendly and welcoming. The food is fantastic and the setting... well it's simply out of this world. The only thing missing in my partner's eyes was a gym. In my opinion however, this isn't necessarily an essential part of a honeymoon ;)"

","Great little hotel and fantastic value","This is a great little hotel and fantastic value for the standard. It feels really well run and thought through. Although they have packed a lot onto the site the grounds are beautiful and the bathrooms, rooms and sitting places outside them feel generous and elegant. I think it is the only place where an outside bathroom (though always beautiful) hasn't slightly given me the creeps.The site is kept beautifully.Because the prices were also very reasonable for all the meals and the food good we did not stray too far from the hotel - clever pricing. The breakfasts were also good - a la carte. I loved that they had not succumbed to buffet breakfasts - which however good always a bit grim - makes you feel you are on the conveyor belt. We had a beach front room which was worth the extra money. Beautiful pool long enough to have a real swim and the sunsets were stunning. Great choice. Would certainly stay here again."

","Heaven on earth","We stayed in a ocean view room but i think all the rooms are beautiful, i stayed here for 3 nights for our 10 year anniversary and everything was amazing. Every member of staff said good morning or good night to you and treated you like you were the only guest.Nothing was too much for the staff from reception-concierge-bar-restaurant-house keeping.My wife is originally from Bali but we chose Lombok for our anniversary alone time together and this was the first time my wife had ever visited the neighbouring island, By the end of the 3 nights, she wanted to stay another.If Quinci doesnt have it, The staff will find it.I had a problem getting a dress made for a wedding in Bali and had lost hope after asking all the tailors i could find in Mataram and sourrounding area, but the concierge Nova didnt just ask around but he didnt stop until he found a tailor who could help us, even though it was due in 2 days. The rooms are amazing, the location on the beach is amazing but the staff are why this place is way above anywhere i have stayed anywhere in the world. The hotel is very close to the beach front and a few hawkers sell there items, but dont be scared to talk to them, there just trying to make a living. As i said to my wife, A little money there way is boosting the economy and helping kids go to school.faultless, book it"

","Perfect stay","Two nights stay review. Large hotel, beautiful grounds and garden, 3 separate swimming pools each of quite a large size. Plenty of sunbeds available without a fight in the early hours to get one.Location next to the ocean (no beach available). approx. 3km outside Senggigi.Rooms (large) are in kind of cottages with ground and first floor.Only ground floor rooms have an outside bathroom, the rooms on the first floor do have a large and topped terrace with daybed and chair.We stayed in a room on the first floor which was clean, large, light and had a good size bathroom with good shower (no bath).Shampoo and shower gel are the types that comes in a small pot with cork that is filled up every day.Service was perfect in every way !!! Food was very good, had breakfast and diner here. Many romantic tables and sites available for couples on honeymoon !Not to forget...happy hour in the bar between 5 and 7 pm were good tasting cocktails are served !One small minor...early wake-up from the mosque (very) near the hotel.We had a perfect stay here !!!"

We stayed for 4 nights at room 78 (partial ocean view). The sea breeze, the tranquility.. I am having trouble finding adjectives to describe this place. From the moment we were picked up by Samsul (qunci staff) who made the one hour trip so enjoyable, Nova, Echo and all the girls from the spa and all the guys from the reception were attentive, fast and provided personalised service. I strongly recommend this place to anyone who wants to relax.. I mean truly relax!!"

","Could have stayed and stayed...","My husband and I along with our 2 young adult sons spent 5 nights at Qunci villas in a 2 bedroom pool villa in September. It was a glorious stay. The rooms are spacious with large ensuite, slightly open to the outdoors, bathrooms. We had a very generous sized splash pool and private deck with 3 lounges and outdoor tables. The villa was only steps away from the hotel restaurants and the 3 beautiful wet-edged pools that run directly along the beach front. The beach provides a beautiful outlook and the opportunity to snorkel in front of the hotel. There are some rocks and corals that have to be negotiated over but you can find channel that provide easy access to the sea beyond. My husband swam along the beach each day and we all snorkeled on several occasions. The staff are friendly and prompt and keen to provide guests with good service. We had breakfast and a few dinners at the hotel. The food is good but quite expensive compared to some outside options. We enjoyed several happy hours which were good value and especially enjoyed our cocktails once we started requesting 'no sweetener'. Like many places in Asia, sugar (or syrup) is added liberally to drinks, both juices and cocktails. If,like us, your not so fond of sugar, the hotel is happy to accommodate.A couple of us also enjoyed some of the spa options which are very reasonably priced and really delightful.A truly wonderful stay and can highly recommend Quncy Villas. Hope to return one day, myself."

","Go to relax by the pool","This is a long review because I feel like our expectations for Qunci were probably unrealistic as a result of the multitude of positive and glowing reviews on TA (no misleading by Qunci themselves to be clear). We enjoyed our stay, but I can now say that Qunci is a very nice looking hotel but not the best I have ever stayed at for that price and the key drawcard to Qunci are the pools and wonderful beach setting.We stayed four nights on our honeymoon. On booking we requested a top floor room and a TV, neither of which were granted on arrival. We were allocated a ground floor ocean view room (#9), which we were immediately disappointed with because there was zero privacy inside as the as the blinds/curtains are the full shade style. For honeymooners especially, this was not ideal as we did not feel comfortable to undress/change clothes/be intimate in the room without closing all the blinds first (as you can see people walking past from inside the room) â and as a result we left the blinds permanently down and so never saw the view from inside our room. A simple solution would be to install a gauzy curtain that most hotels have that allows you to let in light whilst also maintaining a sense of guests' privacy. We requested a room change (ANY other room as long as it was on a top floor for added privacy) but were informed that the hotel was fully booked until the day before we checked out. Personally - I feel that the ground floor ocean view rooms should not be marketed the same as a top floor ocean view room as I can say with certainty that we did not appreciate the view to the fullest due to lack of privacy, and the ground floor views are also obstructed by the pool and bale/huts and so not really equal to a higher floor view where you can take in the view from your balcony. That said the view from the pools was fabulous and so we didnât feel we missed out, but I felt that having paid extra for full ocean view was in hindsight not worthwhile.The resort felt to be at 2 different standards - rooms were more basic and older looking and there was a noticeable absence of amenities higher end resorts provide (beach bags, slippers/thongs, sewing kits, insect repellant...). The main resort was very well designed and maintained with a very luxurious appearance that made the room a bit of a let down by comparison. Restaurants - we ate in the resort for all meals which were very good, and reasonably priced. I understand a previous reviewer's comment about the restaurants all feeling the same, and although I have read owner Scott's reply, I do feel that the menus in Quah and Quali were confusing as the Mediterranean menu had ""ayam talliwang"" and ""rendang daging"" on it when they are both Indonesian dishes (not very Mediterranean at all...). What we loved âhaving the choice of many loungers in the sun or shade and never missing out on a spot. The pools. Happy hour and the very long cocktail list. Service with a smile. Good food. Fantastic views from the pools and restaurants. Complimentary water and fruits by the pool. Would definitely recommend to others but with the more realistic expectations that this hotel is not 5 star luxury but is worthy of a visit simply for the wonderful location and relaxing by the pools and taking in the view."

","A Magical Honeymoon!","My husband and I stayed here for the first 7 nights of our honeymoon. We are both fairly well travelled and rarely stay put in one hotel/resort for long before getting itchy feet and wanting to move on...this is the one exception for us both! We are so glad we decided to stay for the full week. It was the perfect place to unwind and 'be romantic'. We stayed the first night in a garden room as an ocean view room was only available for 6 nights when we booked, and we both agreed that the garden room is still worth booking even if you dont get your first choice of an ocean room as the standard of the rooms is still the same and the experience of the resort is seemingly far superior to other resorts. The rooms were spot on, good size and well decorated with a lovely bathroom and really comfy huge bed! The balcony was perfect for an early evening tipple while watching the resort light up as the daylight faded (the resort is gorgeous in daylight, but has that extra special something when lit up at night). The 3 pools were gorgeous...idylic. The breakfasts were great, lots of choice and really filling. We looked forward to 'happy hour' each day so we could try another new cocktail or two! :) The food was great quality and the theme nights were definitely worth going to and although some people mention it being expensive we found it reasonably priced in comparison to other quality resorts we stayed at in Indonesia. The service was always attentive but never too much...which we really liked. We also went out for a Gilli Island Snorkelling Trip for one day with a guy called Eko ekomangsit@gmail.com who was excellent! Great English and knowledge of the area and he will use your memory card in his underwater camera to take shots and video for you which is a real bonus! (Check him out on tripadvisor for more reviews). All in all we couldn't fault our stay one bit and would highly recommend heading here as it was a highlight of our amazing honeymoon!"

","Nice honeymoon spot for a few days","My husband and I stayed here for 6 nights on our honeymoon. We stayed in a pool villa - which we definitely recommend! The private pools are quite large (for a private hotel room pool) and the rooms are quite large as well. The bathrooms are partially open-air which was very nice! One problem with the room is that there isnt a TV. We learned (through tripadvisor reviews) that you can request one. Tip for you!There really isnt a beach you can lounge on as the tide comes quite high in the morning and in the afternoon the beach is filled with locals trying to sell their goods. On that note, do not sit near the shore if you dont want to have multiple conversations with locals about their products. They are quite nice and will learn your name very quickly, but you are definitely a $$ to them. The food at this hotel was nice, a bit overpriced, but reasonable considering it is a hotel restaurant. There are actually 3 restaurants at this hotel but they all (basically) serve the same menu. The sunset views are stunning!!!! And the entire resort looks upon the beautiful large waves and the gorgeous views. You can't get away from them - huge perk of this hotel. You can take surfing lessons here (if you're a beginner I would recommend it!).The staff are nice, but definitely inexperienced at hotel management. The service was kind but the hotel overall has a strong feeling that it is quite new and hasn't yet grasped true customer service. This is a no-substitution, no ifs-ands-or-buts hotel. They serve only what they have on the menu and the staff only has answers to questions they've been taught in orientation sessions. This hotel definitely has the potential to be great, it just needs a bit more experience. I would definitely recommend a stay here for a few nights, we were pleased overall with the hotel."

","Most relaxing holiday ever","We have just returned from 6 nights in a Qunci Villa upstairs ocean view room and I would highly recommend it to anyone over the hustle and bustle of Bali. Choosing which of the 3 pools to sit at and which cocktail to enjoy at happy hour were probably the biggest decisions we made all week. We only left the hotel for a day trip to the waterfall in Central Lombok which was well worth the drive, otherwise we ate, swam and relaxed by the pool every day. The beach is great for a swim or surf too...the water is so clean and inviting.The art work in the rooms and around the villas is beautiful but the simple placement of a frangipani in every rolled towel by the pool was equally impressive. This was just one aspect of the attention to detail at Qunci. The staff at reception, at the spa, all of the 3 restaurants and around the pool were the happiest, most obliging and genuinely caring hotel staff ever. They can't do enough to make your stay memorable and we will be returning with our family on our next visit...which will be soon. Oh, and there is free wifi!"

","Superb!","We stayed in an partial ocean view room on the ground floor. The rooms are spacious, nicely decorated and well equipped. Bathroom has a good layout and is also very nicely decorated. I love the outside shower! The separate room for clothing and minibar is a plus. The placing of the AC however is weird, situated right above the bed. I had to manually adjust the air direction, to avoid direct airflow to my face while sleeping. The staff is great, and super friendly. They will make your stay as comfortable as it can gets. Breakfast at your own balcony and the turn-down service are excellent. Pools are great, sufficient space all around. Happy hour for cocktails, spirits and alcohol is a nice touch :). Lot of salesmen on the beach though, but hey, everybody is trying to make a living. Drinks and food are surplus. No need to go outside of the resort for lunch or diner!  I highly recommend Qunci Villas Hotel to everyone, who is planning a trip to Lombok!"

","A gloriously relaxing getaway..","Wanted to share my experience of Qunci Villas here on TA as i myself made the decision to book the resort largely based on reviews in TA. We stayed 30th August to 2nd September 2013.We took advantage of Air Asia's flight sale way back in January this year and decided on Lombok as a destination. Initially we had plans to maybe stay in Gili for a night and also to make sure we get to sample what Kuta is like as it seems that is the central spot people gravitate to regarding nightlife etc. But on this trip we could only steal away for 3 nights / 4 days so we decided that we'll stick to one place, with the following activities/priorities at the top of our list: Relax. Surf. Relax some more. And Qunci Villas could not have been a more perfect place to do just that.After reading reviews on TA i made a point to make sure i book an ocean view room on the upper floor. I reminded the resort staff via email several times and upon check-in, the staff welcoming us remarked that we have room no.8 which he says in his opinion is the best room. I wouldn't disagree. The room faces the pool and looks out over the beach, with the bar very close by. Perfect! While my girlfriend has been surfing for years, i have always wanted to learn but never got round to it for whatever reason. Writing in to Qunci to enquire about surf lessons i was glad to hear that you can surf right in front of the hotel with lessons available from the locals. We had a guy called Jimmy and i can proudly now say i know what its like to stand up & ride a wave :) and i think i'm hooked! I think Senggigi is perfect for beginners like me to learn as the waves were not massive. Our days at Qunci starts off with a surf at 7am when the swells are constant and seems at its highest, followed by breakfast on the beach still looking at the surfers out in the water. It really is a perfect way to start your day. While we did have intentions to visit Kuta during our stay, the 2 hour drive there & another 2 hours to get back put us off as that is 4 hours of quality chilling out time we'll be losing out on. We did however arranged a day trip to Gili from the very helpful staff at the concierge costing a reasonable USD85 which gets us our own lil private boat with guide for 8 hours.But apart from the day trip to Gili, and because we didn't have too much time available we never ventured out of the resort. And we don't regret it one bit. I'm really finding it hard to find negatives in this resort. Apart from maybe the hot water in our room being more ""room temperature"" than ""hot"", everything else was great. While the place is very nicely designed, it may not be the most swankiest ""wow that's amazing"" resort you've ever seen. But everything seems very well maintained and the service from the waiting staff, reception and everyone we came to contact with was faultless. Little touches like the guy going around the pool area everyday in the afternoons handing out fresh fruits on a stick to guests was well thought out. It is also quite rare to be in a resort where every single food item we ordered over a period of 4 days were all very good & beyond expectations. The menu throughout the 3 restaurants are varied with a good spread across different cuisines and we had zero reasons to venture elsewhere to eat. Asian delicacies were authentic and not adjusted too much for tourists & the western options were all very good with reasonable prices especially considering most resorts charge far too high for sub-standard food. The crowd at Qunci Villas may be slightly older than what we are used to. If you are looking for a party atmosphere with a busy nightlife this may not be the place for you. As mentioned earlier we were looking for a place to indulge & relax in relative luxury with easy access to a surf spot. Qunci Villas definitely delivered on all 3 of our requirements. So if you're looking for a place to chill out & laze away the day in supreme comfort on a sun bed sipping a cocktail reading a good book by the pool while plates of super yummy bites are brought to you all day long... you can't go wrong with Qunci Villas."

","One word: wow!","My boyfriend and I were staying in this beautiful hotel 3 week ago. It's really a lovely hotel. The staff is very nice, the food in the restraurant is perfect! Everything was just perfect!If you want have a nice massage, you have to take a look at the left of the hotel. There is a very nice lady, with the name 'Sap' who gives massages. She rents the beds and the towels from the hotel itself, & of course she has to pay the hotel little money, so she can gives massages on the beach. Note: Do not book any trips at the hotel! We had a nice man from the beach, his name (I hope I write it down right) is Sooki (see pictures!). We asked him to take us to the Gili Islands to see turtles and the friend&family of the Disney-movie Finding Nemo and we have seen it all! We swim together with 3 turtles and so many beautiful fishes! Without Sooki we would never find any turtles by ourselves. The only thing: it's to far from the city of Sengiggi, so you have to take a taxi. But, that will only cost you 150.000 rph. The city centre is not that big, but there are a few nice restaurants if you want to eat somewhere else then the hotel."

","Nice place but be prepared for a 4.30 am wake up call","We have been here for an extended weekend with our toddler. Here an executive summary of positive and negative things.Positive: A plus is the location nice beach that is not crowded. There are plenty of little excursions and trips one can do in the area. Staying in the lux 2 bed room villa on the hill side we have a great experience with our friendly and Very helpful butler with nice in room cooking.Negative: The staff has to be trained better on how to clean the rooms especially the bathrooms. We had dead flies and cockroaches scattered in the room. This is part of a vacation in the jungle however cleaning them up is a must. Also the toilette smelled of urin this could have been part of the cleaning or the fact that toilette seats are in desperate need of replacement. If u are looking for a quiet place to stay - dont come here it does get LOUD. With the mosque in proximity you will be woken up daily at 4.30 the prayers last for 30min before u can return to dreamland. If u r not a parent and not used to waking up at odd hours this is not the place for you to stay. For family with younger kids also be aware there is no kids entertainement - we knew this and having our own villa with a sizeable pool it did not matter. Be aware there are no mosq nets so if your kid is senstive bring your own net. What made our arrival not enjoyable was the fact that no baby car seat was provided. we had booked one and called on the day of our arrival to ensure we have a seat in the car however the driver forgot. for us this is a no go. we have had deadly accident with kids in the car in SEA and that a hotel like quinci simply forgets is an absolute no go! To sum it up nice place but with areas of improvement for a hotel at this price point."

I have been visiting Lombok for the last 10 years as I have a holiday house in the nearby Gili Meno - Over the years I have been watching this Boutique hotel grow and go from strength to strength. I love the decor and the attention to detail. Coming from Cape Town I really appreciated the Hennie Meyer installations! I laughed last time I was staying there as I made a joke that there had to be a pebble patrol as the pebbles in the garden path were so immaculately kept - only the next day to see infact there are dedicated staff making sure all the pebbles are in place - its those details that help one understand the care involved in the upkeep and presentation of this wonderful property. If one takes time to walk around the property you can really appreciate and absorb the details and integration of the buildings garden and art.The staff are fantastic and really go out their way to make your time there special.

The only problem we had is that we were supposed to have a 2 bedroom pool villa and the travel agent in Paris made a mistake!We were very upset at first as the hotel staff even very nice was more concerned to find the person who did the mistake than to find a solution for us!! They even could not get us 2 rooms next to one another!!!! We were more than angry!!After the first day we calmed down and realized the hotel was very nice, very quiet.The pools are big and nice. The food is excellent and the beach by the hotel very beautiful . Our kids had fun in the waves.The only thing is that if you want to go diving in the Gili island , it is a bit far and you have to go for the entire day...We had a great time! We just wished the staff would have tried a bit more to find a solution and spent less time to find the person to blame..."

","Very romantic hotel","We stayed there for 4 nights as continuously moved. It is really situated at Mangsit area. 10 minutes with a taxi to senggigi. Paul Gaugin reproduction and designer things in rooms are lovely. Open bathroom was gorgeous and just like in dreams! Beachside. Spa may seem overpriced (than on Gili islands, Kuta Bali eg.) but personal care of you so attentively+open bath+romantic atmosphere+ wide range of offers and it is really one of the best places for romantic stay."

","Qunci villas are luxurious stylish and located on absolute beach front the next bay along from sengiggi.","We loved qunci. We had 1 night with our family of 6. Staff were very helpful, many speaking good English and very knowledgeable about everything we enquired about. Resort is beautiful and right on beach - next bay along from Sengiggi. (which is easy and quick toget to by cab).There are a few small cafes on beach close by serving fresh caught fish and local food. We ate at one and itwas good. Breakfast at qunci was fantastic. Pools lovely ,gardens manicured and lush. It's not cheap but it's great if you want some luxury ."

","Great vacation!","On a family vacation, we were 4 adults and 5 children (11-5) - everyone had a fantastic time! The resort is beautiful, with 3 infinity pools (one for adults only), and only steps from the beach, 3 restaurants, serving different foods - seafood, Mediterranean and tapas, with different breakfast menus at each also; each restaurant had kids meals. Fresh fruit galore, offered by servers poolside. The staff around the pool were attentive to every need, whether you wanted to order drinks, snacks, or just wanted an extra towel. The rooms were very spacious, and the bathrooms huge, with the showers open-air, but private. They spray for mosquitoes regularly, so we rarely saw any bugs at all. The prices for food and drinks were extremely reasonable! On the beach, locals were giving surf lessons, which the 2 older boys loved!"

","Simply amazing","Qunci was the first place we stayed during our honeymoon and what a way to begin. The presentation of the hotel is immaculate. A lot of consideration has gone in to the design of the rooms and the aesthetics of the resort. The artwork and decor was inspiring and really captured the essence of Lombok. The rooms and whole resort was kept perfectly clean and was also misted regularly to keep mosquitos to a minimum. The staff were very friendly, helpful and efficient. During the run up to our stay their communication via email was excellent and even though we hadn't paid in advance for the room, felt confident we were going to be looked after. Special mention has to go to Nova once we were there for accommodating our fussiness with deciding whether we wanted to move to an upstairs bungalow or stay in the downstairs one we had. Both were ocean facing, with partly covered outdoor bathrooms. The showers were great. The sun sets directly in front of the resort over the sea. The volcano in Bali peaks through the clouds and together provided some incredible views from the restaurants, pools and sun loungers and balcony of the rooms.Qunci has 3 infinity pools which were all amazing. We only used the central main one as it was right by our room. The hotel has a calming vibe, great for couples but there were also quite a few families there with children of all ages. The food was one of the highlights of our experience. There are 3 different restaurants that cater for all kinds of tastes. Whether it be one of the salads from the extensive and exotic selection, the asian fusion seafood or the incredible Thai set menu we had from the Nooq bar, you shouldn't bother going to Sengiggi town for anything better because you won't find it.The spa treatments were great.A few tips:- We noticed the mosque calls in the morning were a lot louder in the upstairs rooms and did wake us up at 5am. It was barely noticeable in the downstairs room- The rice crispy cheese cake and the chocolate moose (not the green tea one) were divine.- Request a first floor ocean facing room at the front of the resort."

","A Luxury Stay In Senggigi!","On arrival at this hotel my first impressions left my jaw hanging! WOW! As we were early we were shown our way to one of the three restaurants in the hotel for lunch! All of our friends and I really enjoyed the food and it was of a high quality. This was the same throughout the stay! I don't thin I would be able to say a favourite dish as they were all very nice! I also love how each of the restaurants in the hotel had different set dinner menus. So one restaurant might have Thai while the other would have Mediterranean which I thought was quite unique and creative! The rooms were immaculate and very modern and stylish and the beds were very comfy! The attention to detail with the artwork in the rooms really made the rooms that class higher than what most hotels would offer! The outside daybed on the lower level rooms was also nice! The hotel was well maintained and staff friendly and helpful! In fact when we were leaving our rooms to check out we were asked by one of the gardeners if we would like help with our bags to get them to reception which was very good service! Being 14 years old I loved the beach and being able to surf the waves! I spent almost no time in the pool and all of it at the beach! The views over the ocean were fantastic and on clear days you could see one of the volcanoes on the island of Bali! The location of the hotel was too far to walk to Senggigi but a taxi was cheap and easy to get! This was definitely one of my favourite hotels I have stayed at in a while and I would most definitely return back for another peaceful, relaxing stay!"

","Absolutely gorgeous and luxy - can't wait to go back","We spent nine beautiful nights at Qunci for our honeymoon. I had high expectations and they were certainly met by Qunci. We stayed in the private one bedroom villa with pool (a five min walk from the main resort or they are happy to drive you there and pick you up. We loved the walk though as it was through part of the village and past lots of little kids, and cows and goats etc). Our villa was large and beatifully appointed with a comfortable king size bed. The outside area was secluded and we were not overlooked at all. I was nine weeks pregnant when we were there, and I was worried about water, ice, ensuring things were cooked properly etc. My anxiety was wasted, though, as cleanliness is next to godliness for Qunci. Everything was fresh and perfectly cooked. The water is bottled and the ice is made from bottled sources. We ate mostly in the resort and neither of us had any issues at all.FoodThe food is impeccable. A great variety, all fantastically delicious. We mainly had the Indonesian/Asian fare, however, I must confess to having the Ceasar Salad twice as it was so good. Best ever. And we went back to the chocolate pudding about five times. The breakfasts were good, lots of variety and two different breakfast menus to choose from. And we could customise a bit here and there. Pretty decent coffee, too. ServiceI have never seen better service anywhere. The staff were all friendly and accommodating. They all say hello and smile and make you feel like they love being there as much as you do. FacilitiesThe pools (both ours at the villa and the three at the resort) were clean. There were plenty of sun loungers (although if you want a good spot, go down early and claim it with a book). There is a brilliant spa there that is very very well priced. I had a couple of treatments for about a quarter of the price I pay in Australia. TripsWe took a trip to the Gili Islands (organised directly with Sam from the bar on the beach right next to the resort at the Nooq end). It was all day and USD30 each. There were just the two of us and our boat captain Joom (not sure if that's the right spelling) was great. He knew just where to go for turtles and we saw several including a HUGE one that surfaced right next to us. Gorgeous. Sam gave us a water bottle filled with bread that we filled with water and fed to the fish, so there were pretty exotic fish all around us when we were snorkeling. It was pretty special. We also took a trip to a couple of Sasak villages as we wanted to buy some quality handicrafty stuff. Really enjoyed the cultural aspect, but if anyone suggests going to the Hindu temple or the Mall in Mataram - say no! Downside - the only one!There was a mosque that was quite close to our villa and it seemed to have its speaker directed at the villa. A very loud speaker. At running the risk of sounding religiously insensitive, listing to prayer, koran readings and singing five times a day (4.30 - 5.30am, 9-10am, 12-1pm, 5-6pm and 8-9pm - approx) PLUS the additional extras as it was Ramadan (2am music and singing and other random times) was a bit much. The staff provided ear plugs but really it still woke us up in the morning and was a real interruption when trying to laze by the pool at the villa. We ended up avoiding it by spending days at the resort and timing meals appropriately. It was hardly a trainsmash but we'd not book that villa again next time and we'd stay in the resort (rooms 39, 25 and 31 looked good to us)."

","Sea side sophistication","Located right on the beach this very stylish hotel/ villa property leaves little to be desired.Modern rooms ,some with sea views ,partial and garden view rooms are of a high standard with outside bathrooms. Havinf seen most of these rooms it is not worth paying more for the partial sea view as you cannot see hardly any of it! The Garden view rooms tendered to be larger and almost are like a small villa. The sea view rooms are doubl estory and have a comfortable day lounge to look over the sea but can be a bit tight on space.If you are unhappy with your room I would suggest going to the very helpful reception staff and ask for a move.The resturants are excellant with a European and an Indonesian , both are open sided and are well priced ( for a resort) for the quality of food and service. Breakfast is served here as well as lovely outside benchs beside the sea. A very relaxing way to start the day.Two large pools , one adulty only complete the sophisticated feel to this resort.The staff without exception are well trained and nothing is too much trouble.Happy hour drinks are VERY popular.........."

","A Slice of Paradise","I recently stayed at Qunci Villas during a trip to Bali, Lombok and Jogyakarta and my stay there ranks among the most pleasant and pampered I've had anywhere. Every aspect of this resort is impeccably managed and with an unfailing attention to detail from the appointments and cleanliness of the rooms to the beautifully manicured grounds to the fun and colorful local art scattered liberally throughout. We thoroughly enjoyed the view and the sound of the waves from our oceanfront room and sampled delicious fare from all three restaurants. It's a little trek to get there from the airport, but the Hotel arranged a car for us making it completely painless. Once there though, you don't care. It's just that comfortable and serene, luxurious but in the most casual and genuine way. Physically the setting, the grounds, the rooms, are beautiful, but what really makes it special are the people. Everyone was so helpful and courteous and I don't think I encountered a hint of attitude from anyone. We had a couple of spa treatments too - which were divine. The masseur who gave me my Thai massage was as knowledgeable and intuitive as any I've met. While it's wonderful enough just to lounge by the pools, we got a taste of island life by taking part in several excursions. I highly recommend snorkeling in the Gilis. And if you're not afraid of the monkeys, there's some nice biking to do as well. We loved our stay at Qunci Villas and our introduction to Lombok, have wonderful memories and even new friends because of our visit, and would love the opportunity to return."

","A hidden Treasure","This was the first time in Lombok. We were greeted by smiling faces and a very warm reception with a cool towel and complimentary welcome drink.We were shown to our villa on arrival and walked through the grounds. The grounds and the complex in general were well maintained and kept to a high standard. The villa it's self was traditionally decorated with an outdoor bathroom which gave a novel experience to showering. The pool's were fantastic with more then enough lounges to go round. The food was incredible and well priced. The staff were exceptionally helpful and attentive. Qunci is a quiet resort with a very relaxed atmosphere, if your happy to soak up the beauty of Lombok's sunsets and enjoy great food you will love Qunci. If you're looking for a lively resort this will not be for you, qunci did offer themed evenings which offered a different menu and entertainment.Everyday is happy hour between 17:00 - 19:00 the cocktails are well priced and buy one get one free. There was an extensive range of cocktails and all were good quality. I Would return to qunci without a doubt."

","The Perfect Honeymoon","Chose this hotel from trip advisor reviews and we weren't disappointed. Rooms were simple but spotless and comfortable with a lovely, large balcony to chill out on. There were 3 amazing infinity pools which we spent most of our time lazing about by. The staff were always on hand to help and went out of their way to get what ever you needed. All the staff were great but 3 were particularly amazing who looked after us and made our stay enjoyable. Lia, Afif and Surandi. Cocktails during happy hour brought he most perfect shots of sunset and the cocktails were out of this world too. Such a variety, the same could be said about the food. Breakfast was out sat right in front of the sea with the biggest choice on offer and tasty too! In the evenings we experienced all the restaurants and the special events that they held which were all great. We truly enjoyed ourselves on this holiday and it made the perfect honeymoon for us. The resort looks great, the staff are fantastic, the Spa was heavenly . Just loved it! N.b.Only put fitness centre was terrible because as far as we know it didn't have one. Spa was special though."

","Great villas for a very pleasant stay","If one had to design a villa close to the beach with an infinite pool, you would probably design villas like these. Interior decoration is very nice as well as the gardens and all the exterior furniture. If you add very good service, you have Qunci Villas! We had a very pleasant stay with my family in a pool villa. Don't miss it! Just a comment - if you book a boat tour to the Gili Island via the hotel, remember that it is provided by local fishermen and not professionals - therefore don't expect too much customer service; we had a poor experience with a rude guy."

","Nice Designed","I was amazed with the resort, especially when you just entered the lobby area. The breakfast with a set menu was a smart idea. I believe the owner of this hotel love arts, as you can see it throughout the whole resort. The only negative point they have is the room is too congestive one to another, so you won't have privacy. And no TV. However, the room set up is beautiful, I loved their bathroom with semi open shower."

It's definitely the best value luxury resort I've ever stayed in; it's a total bargain really! I don't know how anyone could criticise it!? I stayed in the partial ocean view room, I had actually booked a garden view room but I was very kindly given an upgrade! So I was winning from the start with this one!

","it's a nice place","The hotel is beautifull and the staff is verry friendly . the pool's (3) next to the beach are really nice ! The rooms are clean and housekeeping is supergood . The room has no television so you will need a dvd portable player if you want to see some movies. Above our room was anonther room and those people where verry noisy so i had an appartment feeling about that .... they had children that started running around and slapping with the doors at 07.00 am so thats not really amusing We didn't like the hotel food and the local people who trie to sell you things at the beach are really annoying because you have to say no 1000 times while you are having breakfast or lying in the pool . My wife went to the hotel spa for manicure and pedicure and it was really good and not so expensive . you can take a taxi to sengigi for only 15000 rupiah and eat there at a local restaurant . it was a good hotel , but it could be better ... at the end you pay for it so it chould be perfect ..."

","Excellent Hotel !","This Boutique resort is a true oasis at the beach site of Lombok. Located about an hour from the airport in Sengiggi by taxi for Rp. 250.000. The (Lombok) Kuta beach seems to be more beautiful and will develop over the years. Now only e.g. Novotel. The place to be is the other side, Senggigi where the old airport was. The whole designed set up of Qunci Villa's is very nice in many details. Beautiful garden and reception with wonderfull staff. The Bar, restaurant and pool area are overlooking the beach and sea. The bungalows have two levels with a balcony. Rooms can be a little noisy. The rooms are nicely designed with an open outside bathroom with shower. We experienced the downstairs as nicer in design especially the bathroom. Where the upstairs balcony can be nicer to sit down and enjoy life.There is a mini bar, safe, AC, wifi all nice and convenient and of good quality. Would question the value of booking an ocean view room as many have limited view and so many other options to enjoy the seaview with great relaxing areas. Excellent luggage service and friendly staff. There are 3 very nice pools and one of them adults only although no young kids jumping around. Behind each pool there are many sun beds and lounge huts. The 3 pools makes the resort more private and exclusive although still many rooms. The pool area offers enough high quality sun beds, towels and parasols to relax. Many options for sun or shadow. The pool service can be more pro active as people claim a sun bed early without using it, just very late/limited or just leave the towels not knowing if you can take it or not. The hotel is outside the small town Sengiggi which can be reached by taxi for Rp 15.000 only as well many restaurants offer a free shuttle service like âSquare Restaurantâ by far the best in town. Good location for taking a private chartered boat to the Gili islands from Sengiggi beach. Very nice snorkeling at the 3 Giliâs a full day costing total US $ 70,- Easy to rent at agency across âAsmara restaurantâ or rent a motorbike for $5 a day. Food and drinks are priced in line with quality of the resort. Breakfast you can enjoy in one of the two restaurants or at a private table at the beach site all overlooking the sea. Also dinner is offered at a table right on the beach. The wide choice on the breakfast menu leaves you enough personal and special requests without additional charge. Fresh juices, fruit, baguettes and espresso or cappuccino are offered. This hotel is one of my favorites having stayed in so many over the world. I would expect though that the hotel would offer down covers and down pillows ( even better preferred pillow selection ). This i.s.o. sheets with blankets and very firm pillows. This all in a room and bathroom which I would review for more up to date new design details to bring it in line with the rest of the resort. Blankets are so from the 80âs downgrading the resort and just hate to wake up with a blanket in my face. Even the low cost All Seasons Hotel in Denpassar offers down covers and pillow selection of choice ! Overall very nice helpfull staff, beautifull resort and a great place to stay !!"

","The best part of our trip!!","We stayed at Qunci from 1st-5th July 2013.It was part of our 16 days vacation in which we also stayed in Bali at Legian, Ubud and Kuta.When working out the places we wanted to stay, we really hesitated with Lombok, as no one we knew personally had been there.Like many people I reviewed comments on Trip Advisor and read various travel books, I decided that Qunci was the place I wanted go to, we are so happy that we did, it really was the highlight of our trip.We decided to get to Lombok by plane as we both get sea sick so boat was not the best option for us.We travelled with Lion Air, it was only $60.00 Australian return each! The flight was only about 20 easy minutes.I only e-mailed Qunci a few hours before we were due to land to see if they could pick us up from the airport, from the airport to the villas was about an hour or so. We arrived in Lombok, as we walked out of the gates our driver was ready and waiting holding up a card with our name, I was happy that we had a driver pick us up as there was so many people at arrivals waiting for family and it was a bit overwhelming being so busy, it was a relief in a new place to see someone waiting for you to take you safely to your resort.Our driver was very friendly and pointed things out along the way and shared with us his local knowledge.Upon arrival at Qunci we were very pleasantly surprised with a welcome drink, refreshing towel, smiling faces on all of the staff and a real sense of warmth and second to none hospitality!!Our villa, I think was number 77, was stunning! It was very clean and modern and spacious, back home a villa like this would be upwards of $350 per night so we found it awesome value for money.Every day our room was cleaned immaculately and each night our sheets turned down and sprayed for mozzies (we never had any mosquito problems at all) frangipani flowers were placed on the bed which was a nice touch.We had a beautiful outdoor lounge area front porch where we had our breakfast delivered to each morning, the food was fantastic and there was a great selection.We found the villas so peaceful (we did not hear even a whisper from the mosque that some reviewers complained about) There is so many lounges around the pool areas to choose from to enjoy your privacy and we found it was a perfect couples resort as there wasn't heaps of kids running around like there was in Bali.You can just relax, enjoy the pool or snorkelling in the beach, a beautiful cocktail (always made with fresh fruits), and choose from a variety of cuisine from one of the three restaurants (we enjoyed our food at each of them) The staff are so friendly and so helpful, nothing is to much to ask, it was so refreshing to see staff that seem to live to work and not work to live as we are used to back home.A must do, is to visit the spa! We had a luxurious manicure and pedicure one day and a full pampering massage and coconut body scrub which included a soothing bath in a private outdoor stone bath filled with spices and flower petals, while sipping an energising fresh herb tea another day.I think the girls name was ""Diane"" that did both of my treatments (so sorry if I got that wrong) she was so lovely and friendly and really was a beauty treatment expert.My boyfriend and I both came out feeling like a million dollars.The time you are pampered for, the products used on you, like fresh coconut pulp, vanilla, essential oils and so on, we felt guilty at how little it cost us, it really is so inexpensive for a million dollar experience!We had no problem with Internet access on my I-Pad and my partners Laptop, they both worked just as well as at home, for a fairly under developed, isolated island we weren't expecting to get much Internet access at all so again, another pleasant surprise.At the end of our stay we were driven by one of the staff, unfortunately we can't remember his name after meeting so many great people, but he was such a nice person, it made the drive to the airport both fun and felt like a short drive, as we chatted about some of the many differences in our Australian ways to the ways of Lombok and the people.It really was a great way to end an awesome part of our trip.We thank all of the wonderful staff at Qunci for making our stay so great.We will definitely come back again, we have told so many people about Qunci I'm now selfishly thinking that we should have kept it our little secret slice of paradise!!"

We were happy that we've the garden view rooms as its surround by a lush garden and quietness, compared with seaview rooms, which can be noisy as its next to the 3 infinity pools.The spa provide good quality massage. The spa are very professional. The only regret we have is that we should have extended our holidays."

","Exceeded Our Expectation","We stayed here for three nights and it was our first experience in Indonesia. Our travel agent had the hotel rated as 'Medium' so we didn't expect it to be a good as it was. The room was spacious and had a large balcony with a daybed and although we didn't have a sea view, the room overlooked the beautiful gardens. The only downsides with the room were the limited cupboard/drawer space, (the wardrobe was just an area in the bathroom with a rail and couple of shelves), and the lighting wasn't good for putting on your make-up! The other downside of this hotel was the noise from the Mosque, we were here at the start of Ramadan, and it seriously affected our sleep. Unfortunately this is the only reason for not awarding five stars because sleep quality has to be an important consideration in a hotel. The restaurant options were great with the two main restaurants offering either Mediterranean or Asian and then a daily changing Thai menu available in the bar. They serve 241 cocktails every evening, which you can enjoy in the bar itself or in one of the restaurants, which is good as the bar is quite small. You should definitely take advantage of this as the cocktails are fantastic, I can highly recommend the Watermelon and Lime Leaf Martini or the Snake Fruit & Chilli Martini. Breakfast is also great with lots of choice. The pools and gardens are lovely and the hotel is right on the beach. There are always locals trying to sell jewellery and sarongs etc on the beach, but they don't enter the hotel grounds so it's easy enough to avoid if this bothers you. The staff throughout the hotel were always friendly, professional and helpful and really made you feel welcome. We were only there three nights but felt like we'd been regulars for years by the time we left. So well done Qunci Villas we look forward to returning one day!"

","Beautiful resort and fantastic location","Stayed 3 nights here, our partial ocean view suite was average (especially as we'd just been at Jeeva Klui up the road), but fine. A little small for 2 adults and 2 children (4 and 5 years old), decor could def do with a refurb. Loved the layout of the resort, lots of lush planting and beautiful swimming pools. Two big ones, one mainly for younger people, the other ended up more family friendly - people divided themsleves naturally :) Plus one 'adults only' pool. Would not recommend for toddlers, only for kids who can swim fairly well as all pools are 1.60m deep with only small ledges / steps around the outside. Our kids loved it, not too many others of their age, but enough. Slightly nicer beach than Klui (less rocky) with a surf lessons possible out front. Our room was well located in that it was next to the bar, e.g. parents could sit in the evening with the room in plain sight. Great breakfasts - the restaurant was very good in general. Lovely staff and not expensive to cab into Senggigi. Privacy aspect is low here and it was crowded compared to other resorts we stayed at in Lombok, the ocean front rooms faced literally right onto the pool. But definitely a nice, lively atmosphere - especially at the cocktail hour /. sunset."

","The Best in Lombok","We stayed 2 nights at this beautiful resort on June 18 - 20, 2013 enroute from Bali to Makassar and I am glad to say that our entire expirence was nothing but positive. Qunci is a very well maintained and manicured resort despite that it has been around for more than a decade. It is not just hotel or resort but it's more like a gallery with rooms. It's beautifully designed with high-end arts and decors which very well positioned and placed. Everywhere you turn you would see beautiful piece of arts, whether it just a stone carving, totem poles or simple potteries. Though the resort is small but it has three gorgeous pools right at the edge of Lombok straight. Never feel crowded and there's always place for you take a dip in. Well thought, since guests would spend the whole day lounging by the pool since Lombok has nothing to offer outside the resort.Few items I noted during our stay:1. Check-in - is quick and immediately taken to our villa. However, the gentleman who checked us in, in my opinion was not very friendly, he was never smile and he explained about the resort and things in very bland way. No enthusiasmn whatsoever. He could be just having a bad day that day, I am not sure. We first didn't like the villa because of the location was tucked in corner - very dark and my wife didn't have a good vibe of it. So we asked for another room with a better view and location. For $15 a night we got upgraded to a partial ocean view on second story villas right behind the Quali restaurant. Loved it! Note for management, the gentleman who made this happenned was Wayan and boy, he was 180 degree opposite from the other gentleman. He was full of smiles, friendly, very polite. Great asset for Qunci.2. Breakfast - Yes breakfast was included with our room rate, however, for those who have been staying in other hotels in Indonesia with breakfast, DO NOT expect to feast on a buffet. The breakfast was ala cart but it had decent amount food and it tasted better I think. Being on the remote island where food is scarce I think this is good idea, so people don't need to waste too much food.3. Food quality - Top notch for a resort on an island. We had our lunch and dinner and snacks at the hotel at the entire stay and it was worth it. The price was just right and quality and the taste of the food that we ordered were excellent. I still miss the 'Tongkol...' something. It was so delicious. We went outside the resort to Senggigi to see what they offered, most of the restaurants had comparable price to the resort and the place was not as clean as the resort. So that's the reason why we decided to have our meal at the resort. We tried their 'Pina coladas' at the buy one and get one free' happy hour offer - I think it's worth it. You can't really get drink on coctails so if need to get high order straight liquer instead.4. Pool - It has three gorgeous pools with same depth, 160 m. So if you are travelling with small children, be careful since there's not one a pool for children. I think the resort was intended for couple and not for families6. Insects - Being on a tropical island, issues with insects of course is expected. We had ants issue in the bath room area but it doesn't bother us much, however management may need to take a look at this issue.So if you are thinking of coming to Lombok and have been browsing around - Look no further. What you see on their website that's what you get. Oh don't forget they have outdoor shower where you can have shower at night while looking at the stars above, how fancy is that???"

","Lombok is Bali from 25 years ago","Lombok Island is the same as Bali from 25 years ago.Quinci hotel is the best in this region. We stayed for 4 night before we returned after our Indonesian trip back to Europe. Do not visit Indonesia during Ramadan, sleeping with earbuds during you vacation is not so nice. Did had a room with side vieuw on beach what is as good as frontal vieuw. For the rest verry good hotel, friendly people, good food ..."

","Half way around the world for the vacation of a lifetime!","After traveling for over 22 hours from JFK to Lombok Island, my wife, two daughters and I were definitely in need of some TLC. Qunci Villas did not disappoint! From the moment we arrived at the concierge desk and were offered cool towels and refreshing drinks by smiling staff members, I knew we were in good hands. It's rare to visit a place that actually matches and even exceeds the images that you see on the web site, but Qunci does just that. The place is simply beautifully designed. The rooms are spacious and well appointed and the diverse grounds are a seamless flow of flower beds, stone paths, gazebos, infinity pools, and objets d'art, all at varied elevations. The result is that my eyes never tired of the views wherever I stood. In the evenings, it almost gets better with a constellation of artistically placed landscape lighting enhancing the romantic mood. Throughout the resort are elegant pieces of exotic hardwood furniture. When I asked about them I was directed to 'Galerie Nao' in nearby Senggigi where my wife and I met the lovely proprietor, Agnes Bok, who showed us a wide selection of contemporary wood and stone furniture. If you're a design buff like I am I highly recommend a visit. The three restaurants at Qunci are all top notch and in the evenings are buzzing with activity. The menus are diverse and always changing. For dessert, my daughters practically lived on a chocolate delight called Mt. Rinjani. The theme nights are great fun, especially the beach front bar-b-que featuring a whole tuna that is cut into steaks and grilled. If you love seafood, don't miss it. From the resort's beach front it's easy to hire a catamaran for day trips to nearby Gillis (small islands) for snorkeling and diving. The beach itself is fun to explore but dealing with the local hawkers can get old. If you're clear about your intentions not to buy, they will respect it. However if you do decide to buy some souvenirs, be ready to negotiate. Finally, I can't say enough about the wonderful staff, particularly Azhari, Ayu, and Joe, that may ultimately be the best part of the experience. They are all genuinely friendly as well as very professional and ready to serve your every need. If I had to pick my best Quinci moment, it would be sitting on the sun bed, sipping a cool cocktail and watching the surface of the infinity pool fuse into the aquamarine ocean as the sun sets over the Bali coast - my portal to paradise compliments of Qunci Villas. It seems like that plane ride wasn't so bad after all!"

","Honeymoon Paradise","We booked Qunci Villas about 12 months ago, for our honeymoon at the end of June / beginning of July. During those 12 months, we read a lot of reviews about Qunci. The major theme coming from them was that guests book for a short period of time, say 4 or 5 days, and wish that they stayed a bit longer. So we were glad that we booked for 2 weeks...When you get to the hotel, you immediately realise that it's a sanctuary. It is designed to make you feel relaxed, and it works really well. We travelled 32 hours to get to Qunci, and were really grateful of the really warm welcome.I don't want to repeat all the positive points from the previous reviews. There are a lot: amazing sunsets, fabulous infinity pools, brilliant spa and attentive service. I would definitely recommend the hotel if you are visiting Lombok. In fact, if you are a couple and looking to relax, there aren't many reasons why you'd choose anywhere else...I'd like to take this opportunity to mention some little aspects of the hotel, that I think would make it even better than it was. I think we only noticed these points because we were there for 2 weeks. If we were there for a shorter period of time, we probably wouldn't have noticed.\- Lombok is a developing country, and is new to the tourist market, and it's pretty ignorant for guests to expect everyone to speak English. I thought that the staff's level of English was good (we don't speak Sasak, unfortunately) but we noticed that the staff seem to have stock phrases, or comments that they repeat - ""How are you?"", ""What can I do for you?"" ""Can I get you anything?"" It makes a really lovely service, but when you ask for something more complex, more often than not, the staff don't understand, and you have to repeat yourself. This is a minor minor point but it might be useful for the hotel to know.- It might be useful for the hotel to stock some deck chair towels near the pools during the day. Some days it rained, so we went inside. When we returned, the towels had been taken, but we had to wait around 10 minutes for two more towels to be brought to us.- The hotel staff are attentive, friendly and on hand, but the service isn't personalised. We didn't stay at the hotel expecting a butler, but the staff didn't remember some of our (small) requests. One example is at breakfast... I must say that sitting outside facing the sea whilst eating breakfast is one of the most luxurious things that I've done... The waiting staff were mostly the same people, and we asked for some hot milk for our coffee every morning. Every day. For the first few days, I can understand that the staff might not remember, but we asked every day, usually to the same people... It's not a massive point, but it makes a big difference to the level of service received. Only one member of staff, Lin, asked our names and remembered us. She made that difference between good service, and excellent personalised service.Some recommendations to guests: Get a massage, both in the spa and the one on the beach (Rp.100,000). Chat to the hawkers. They're great and everyone needs a blanket. One of the hawkers has a boat and will take you to the Gilli islands, and give you snorkelling gear etc. Rp. 700,000. Do it. Great fun. Taxi to Senggigi is Rp. 15,000. There are a few restaurants, shops etc there, but Lombok won't win any prizes for incredible tourist action, yet...Overall, the hotel is fantastic and if you're going to Lombok, stay at Qunci."

","A breathtaking sunset ...","Qunci Villas Hotel in Senggigi (Lombok)A breathtaking sunset ...We stayed here 4 nights on our 3 week trip through Indonesia. The hotel is located directly on the beach and has 3 infinity pools offer stunning views of the sea and Mount Agung. If you want to experience one of the most beautiful sunsets you should definitely come here.The staff was incredibly friendly, highly trained, hard workers and were always ready with a smile for us. Our compliments to Joe, who has given us a ""top service"". Very nice for us that he also spoke a little Dutch, which guaranteed great conversations. Terima Kasih!Your day cannot go wrong if you start with a very generous breakfast overlooking the beach and the blue sea. The food in general was very good. Every night there was a different theme night, which caused a lot of variation.The rooms are spacious and clean, however on a windy day the roof will be a bit noisy. I would also look into providing better beds, these are a too hard but then again, all the rest is without comment.In general, Qunci Villas is an excellent place to enjoy tranquility and a relaxed atmosphere. At the very comfortable sunbeds at the beautiful pool (middle pool) you could stay up till the sun sets and this with a perfectly made cocktail (they have happy hour too).We would like to thank everyone, especially Joe and Katrisna who gave us an unforgettable stay.PS Remember to bring your earbuds, in the morning you can hear the song of a mosque, not too loud but you can hear it.Kristoff & Jasja"

","Fantastic property!","Quinci Villas is a beautiful hotel and an ideal escape for a romantic break. The staff are very friendly and the location is amazing! A lot of thought has gone into the design of the hotel and they even have a light that illuminates the waves at night-time. Although the staff are extremely friendly and are on hand for all your needs, sometimes it can be a bit overwhelming if they are standing around watching you. I would personally prefer less fuss but that's just a personal preference.I would highly recommend this hotel - it's stunning and one of the nicest properties I've stayed in on my travels worldwide!"

","Fantastic Lombok","Lombok is well worth the visit and Qunci villas were fantastic. Our ocean view room was one of the best I have ever stayed in. There is nothing as exotic as having an outdoor shower whilst listening to the call to prayers! Staff were fantastic and the spa was very affordable $35 Australian dollars for an hour massage. First place I haves stayed where breakfast is not a buffet. There is a mix and match menu starting with freshly made juice, a fruit plate and then pancakes, eggs, turkey bacon, cornflakes etc and then tea or coffee. Breakfast was available in your room or by the beach.The pool was beautiful, clean and plenty of chairs and towels. Our family of 8 loved Qunci and I can't wait to go again for a peaceful relaxing exotic holiday.Our only negative comment was we could never get money exchanged at the resort. There was always an excuse, too late, Sunday , accountant not here, and we eventually got money changed with much negotiation. My tip is to exchange money at Denpasar airport on way over. Very small criticism for a great place."

","A great week at Qunci","This would have to be one of the more pleasant vacation spots in Indonesia. Qunci villas at Sengiggi is right up there in the high stakes for many reasons. Hospitality, service, luxury, position and friendliness. My wife and I had a week stay here on 28th June. There was nothing we could fault about this place. Staff are very professional as well as pleasant and friendly. Food was divine at all meals breakfast,lunch and dinner. This resort is right on the beach, but only about 10 minutes cab ride to Sengiggi. We would highly recommend this resort to anyone, families, couples even if traveling solo."

","Very good facilities, lovely sun sets. Shame about the hawkers","This is a good sized resort but there is plenty of space so it doesn't feel like your on top of everyone. 3 beach front infinity pools with a great sea view for sunsets - only let day by the 20 or so faces staring at you all day trying to sell you something every time you looked at the view. Charming and friendly hawkers but its not a private experience being watched all dayThat shouldn't put you off. You get used to it. The rooms are very good. Spacious. Nicely decked out. Only lack a iPod / music connectionThe restaurant food was very good and the service excellent. However we stayed for 5 days and got a little tired of the fixed menuWell worth a visit if you are looking for some creature comforts in LombokP.s. I wouldn't recommend Sea Marlin boat transfers. And on dept make sure the hotel doesn't get you to the harbour too early - there is nothing there and they got us there 2 hours early for an 11 am departure and the. The boat was another 2 hours late. Would have preferred to been by the hotel pool!"

","Lovely Qunci","My husband and I visited Qunci Villas in Sengiggi for our honeymoon and we were certainly not disappointed. We arrived late on our first day and were taken to our one bedroom room with a pool and even though it was dark, it was lovely! Feeling quite tired from our day of travelling, we jumped straight into the pool for a night swim and then showered in the open air bathroom. We walked over to one of the restaurants to find the Qunci BBQ and live music was taking place and although we had missed it, the usual restaurant menu was more than sufficient. I would highly recommend the Mount Rinjani chocolate pudding (forget the actual name) for dessert - divine! Upon sitting down for dinner we were greeted by a member of staff who introduced themselves and provided the best service throughout our meal. We slept wonderfully well that first night.The breakfasts at Qunci are fantastic, with a large variety to choose from, catering to everyone's needs. You can order breakfast to your room or villa for free if you prefer but would highly recommend having breakfast overlooking the sea with the view of Mount Agung in front.Unfortunately my husband had a bad reaction to his malaria tablets and so we informed the staff who then very kindly called a doctor out who arrived within a few hours. He was extremely helpful and thankfully my husband was feeling much better within a few days.The hotel is built up on a platform above the beachfront which means the local hawkers walk past regularly trying to sell goods to the guests. Most of them seem to come from villages near Mataram (capital) and travel over to Sengiggi to trade each day. I would recommend taking the time to chat with the locals, they will only hassle you more if you don't! In all seriousness, they are the friendliest people and very interesting too! Would highly recommend walking down the beach to the right of the hotel and having a beer or food in one the beach cafes. The owners are hard working families and have some interesting tales to tell about local life.The Qunci spa is one the best in the area! Definitely the best we experienced on our trip! Our first trip to the spa was perfectly timed during a huge thunderstorm, there's nothing more relaxing than having a Balinese massage listening to the rain and thunder outside. Bliss.The one small thing I would say is that there perhaps could have been more information made available in the room about trips to local points of interest in Lombok as we hardly saw the island at all which we regret slightly as it's beautifully scenic.If you're visiting Lombok, then you HAVE to visit Qunci."

The staff is really exceptional. The service is quick, friendly, relaxed and they really enjoy what they do and are sooo willing to help you out. The food is wonderfull in all 3 restaurants and also the choices for breakfast and drinks is magnificent. Everything is really fresh and of good quality.

","Absolutely perfect","Our family our four, including two adult daughters, had a week at Qunci and we couldn,t fault it. The staff have an exceptional service mentality and seem genuinely happy to be working there. We mentioned in passing that it would be good to have tea making facilities in the room and they were there within the hour! The spa is to die for - us three girls had the 3-hour package and floated on a cloud for the rest of the day. We had originally requested a villa - fully booked - but the two rooms we had were fantastic & didnt feel like 2nd best. It wouldn,t suit the hyperactive tourist but is perfect for a real chillout. We will definitely be coming back - cocktails by the pool with the sun setting is very hard to beat!"

","Heaven!","A friend and I spent two weeks at Qunci....this is about my fifth time and I plan on coming back again and again. Love it!! The staff are wonderful, look after your every need and from day 1 know and use your name......they become your friends. The staff remember us each time and come to say hello with a big smile on their faces, greeted like we are long lost friends by people like Lia, Wee Wit and many other members of staff. Each day there is something being done to improve the grounds including removing rogue coconuts...a wonderful sight seeing one of the gardeners shimmy up a palm tree to remove branches and coconuts to keep visitors safe. Having the beachfront as your breakfast view, looking across the ocean to Bali and Mount Agung while the fishermen are making their way home, is the best way to start your day.....and the choice/quality of the breakfast is great as is the meals on offer during the rest of the day....and good value for money. Qunci is a great place to stay...I spent 8 days there this time round and could have easily stayed another 8, can't wait to get back there."

","Paradise","This place is just beautiful! Everything is so tastefully done from the decor and stunning artworks in the rooms and around the grounds to the little touches like the scattering of frangipani on the bed when it is turned down each evening. As I travelled alone I did find it a little quiet for me as there are no televisions in the rooms but this is by no means a criticism as lack of TV adds to the tranquility of the place. There is wi fi available so one is certainly not cut off from the rest of the world! The spa is beautiful and all the staff are so friendly throughout the resort - from the gardeners, the waiters, Reception staff - in fact anyone wearing a Qunci uniform. I don't know who the previous reviewer met as I thought all staff seemed proud and happy to be working here. Sometimes people forget to say the positives but are very quick to come forward with negatives and it can be easy to concentrate only on that. Please assure your staff that they are doing a great job - some people are just very hard to please!!"

","Having our wedding there was the best decision - incredible attention to guests","We stayed at Qunci, just the two of us many moons ago and fell in love with the beautiful surroundings and the wonderful service. The price is so affordable considering the quality of service and we loved the menu selection. The second time we returned to Qunci, the restaurant manager came racing across the gardens to personally welcome us back. We were so amazed that the staff remembered us from our brief visit so when it was time for us to find a venue for our wedding we didn't hesitate about holding our wedding at Qunci. Wiwit helped us with organising everything from the flowers to the menu and was so patient. Nova, Echa, Widi, Sendy and the rest of the team at the front desk were very welcoming with all the people who flew in for our wedding party and accommodating all sorts of last minute requests and changes. On the day of the wedding the staff was so helpful and many of them came to personally congratulate us. Some of our guests went exploring the other islands but the majority of us were content to relax at Qunci for the duration of our stay.We are going back most likely to celebrate our wedding anniversary."

","Awesome resort - some details","Qunci Villas was a part of our honeymoon. It was great place. The staff is very friendly, they are always serving you and smiling. Athmosphere is very comfortable and the place is great.However, there seemed to be some mistakes; we reserved a table for dinner on reception but in the evening in the restaurant they didn't find any reservation and we got extra table between toilet and kitchen. On the previous day before checking out we had discussed about the details on reception and everything was okay. Later someone called to our room and asked whether I would like to discuss about checking out even though we had done it already. Our taxi was 15 minutes late in front of the hotel...One day we had ordered our lunch on restaurant where were about 5 persons. We had to wait food about 40 minutes, that was weird.Speaking with the staff was little bit complicated sometimes because of their not-so-good English.But whatever, Qunci Villas is very nice place to relax, that's for sure!PS Hopefully everyone going there is good at sleeping; there are mosque sounds for example at 5.00 am."

","PangH","Just came back from a 3 nights stay in Qunci Villas. It was the perfect place for a quiet getaway. We stayed in Partial sea view and the room was exactly what you see on the net. It took about 1.5 hour to get to Qunci from the airport and Indonesia blue bird taxi always provide reliable service. Alternatively, pick up service can be arranged and it costs about USD$30 per way. Upon arrival, we were greeted by friendly front desk staff Nova and he is such a sweet guy. The check in process was pleasantly smooth.During our stay in Qunci, the occupancy rate was about 97-99% but the beauty of it was you don't really feel it at all. To the management, you have done a great job keeping the whole place so peaceful and quiet. You will not be disappointed if you are looking for a quiet relaxing getaway. The only sound you will hear is the soothing sound of the waves. When it comes to the prayers from the nearby mosque, I personally found it to be very soothing and calming.Went to their spa almost everyday during our stay. My partner and I totally enjoyed the massage treatment. Spent a couple of hours in the spa, then straight to the pool to enjoy their buy one free one happy hour cocktails, witness the spectacular sunset over Mount Agung in Bali, this is what I called paradise.It is not without it's flaws of course. Eg. the hotel is a bit far from everything but this could be the advantage - we just didn't wanna leave the hotel at all (depends on how you view it). The sea was a bit rough and not ideal for swimming in it (but it was great for surfing). From the flawless service to the spectacular sunset, I wish I could have stayed longer. Anyway, we will definitely be going back there again soon!"

","Words cannot describe","Ok, so just to give you an idea of how amazing this hotel is - we are writing this review whilst still in the hotel, our last night here. You can read all about the amazing views from this hotel and also the surrounding beauty of Lombok in other reviews, this one will be based on the hotel and service. Our stay at QV is part of our Honeymoon trip and are we glad that we spent our first 6 of the nights here, if we had to go back to London tomorrow then we would still be buzzing. My wife and I between us have 34 + years in the Service industry so know good service when we receive it and the service here is exceptional. The staff here are personable, professional, attentive, friendly, and we believe genuinely enjoy working here. We recommend QV to families, Honeymooners, Older couples, anyone. Prices are affordable and not too far off what you will be charged in Sengigi town. The food served from the restaurants is high quality and the time that we weren't 100% satisfied, we were refunded and visited by the Chef with an apology! Anyone who does not enjoy their stay here either did not do their research into the type of hotel it is or, is a mentalist. To the owner (who I'm sure is reading this), the whole team is amazing but two in particular who's names we can supply if we have your details. Finally, the Spa is amazing and the best we have ever had. Massages are just WOW."

","Stunning location and faultless service!","Our family of four (kids aged 7 & 3) had a very restful and enjoyable holiday at Qunci Villas. Unusually, we had requested for a keyboard to be provided during our stay as our daughter had two major performances to prepare for within 2 days of returning back home, and Qunci went to great lengths to ensure it was there from our first day to our last - AND WITH COMPLIMENTS! We were very impressed with how generous the staff in all areas of the Qunci, from front desk to spa and restaurants. A request for an extra banana was met by a plate full! Meals were generally good and reasonably priced and happy hour each day was perfect. After discussing with the staff about where to eat whole grilled fish (ikan bakar) at one of the local ""warungs"" for dinner, they suggested speaking to the Qunci chef on our behalf to cook this local specialty rather than run the risk of suffering from poor food prep when eating outside food. It was perfect - in fact they really should consider adding that permanently on the menu! We also loved the curried snapper in the sourish tangy soup with rice. We had a Garden View room which had just enough space to fit an extra bed and cot. Rooms were very cosy and well designed with an outdoor sitting area which was well utilized when the kids were asleep or when it rained one afternoon. Our TV (which can be requested for) had unreliable reception often but we recommend bringing an HDMI cable so you can watch your own movies/ programs. Perfect for a rainy day or whilst waiting for 7pm dinners. The beach, whilst beautiful, is not suitable for kids to play on as its very stony and a little dangerous. The pools are beautiful though, however parents with small kids should note that there is no shallow area, just some large steps where they can play on if they cant swim. We spent five nights and found it wasnt long enough so next time I think we shall be there for at least a week. There are no major shopping centres around but we did hire a motorbike for the five days and also took a morning out to visit the temple at Lingsar. Qamboja Spa is a definite highlight too. The masseurs are all very well trained and extremely professional. Reasonably priced for the services offered. Do note they dont offer any Gelish services for the mani/pedis (cant remove Gelish either) so its best to have it removed before arriving. Can I suggest that they add the traditional Indonesian ""cream baths"" to the spa menu too - very indonesian and would be a hit if added im sure! All in all a perfect beach/pool holiday. Thank you for arranging the keyboard Nova and Viki!!!"

","Excellent Service, Fantastic Views and Loved Happy Hour!","We stayed in one of the basic rooms at Qunci Villas, but would have chosen to stay at the newer wing should we have known (older rooms are a little darker, little natural light). Other than that, our stay at Qunci was absolutely fantastic!The staff were all very friendly and would greet you everytime they see you. Breakfast was great, and you can choose to sit right in front of the sea, watching the surfers do their thing while we eat our breakfast (which btw is great, but my favourite is the Eggs Bene). The resort had 3 pools, and all were great and overlooking the sea. Our favourite was Happy Hour every day from 5-7PM where cocktails were 1-1, such a great deal! Other than the two days spent diving with DSM Dive, our entire trip was spent lazing around the resort. Food was good, but expensive for Indonesian standards.Last but not least, our experience at the spa was absolutely fantastic. Their massages are top class and as expected, their therapists were all very friendly as well. If I were to come back to Lombok, I'd definitely stay at Qunci Villas again, perhaps this time in a better room with a view :)"

","Our honeymoon june 2013","Wow - what an amazing beautiful hotel. We did not want to leave from the setting. We stayed for 6 days, and altough a remote location with no big shopping/activity etc facilities nearby it was perfect beach retreat. The staff were very helpful from the minute we arrived taking care of our requests etc. We stayed in a garden view bungalow, and it was carefully and well designed. The outside shower very natural. The 3 x pools were beautiful overlooking one of balis mountains, beautiful at sunset (happy hour). The restaurants were lovely, we liked the lombok chicken wrap and thai green curry! The cocktails were amazing and made to fresh, our favourite was the orange and cinamon - delicious. We enjoyed a private boat trip (organise by hotel) to the gili islands snorkling, which was incredible. Our only advice would be to wear a t-shirt as we both burnt, and my husband ended up with blisters on his back. We would be back tommorow if we could give up the day jobs!"

","Just lovely","We travelled together for a girls trip and stayed here for 4 nights, and were very pleased with our twin garden room. The outdoor bathroom was huge and beautiful, the gardens immaculate, the cocktails during happy hour, and tapas around the pool were delicious and reasonably priced. We enjoyed our dinner and had a choice of 3 restaurants. A choice of 3 swimming pools, each overlooking the sea, and Bali, with beautiful sunsets. The delicious breakfast was al la carte with a good selection, and enjoyed overlooking the ocean. It was easy to walk along the beach and hire a boat for a trip around the islands. The staff were friendly and very helpful. This hotel would be perfect for romance."

","HONESTLY!","I was just reading some of the reviews of Qunci.And HONESTLY,come on.To say that it is ""all wrong"".I have been in business long enough ,to know that you cannot please everybody.But what more can you want ,than a resort like Qunci.We have a pool villa and it is perfect.Beautiful art pieces everywhere.The grounds are immaculate.The staff is very well trained and is always willing to help.Again what more do you want?What were you looking for??Maybe the food is not always what you expect,but that can happen anywhere.My husband is a Master baker from Holland and we sometimes had people that were not happy.But 99.9% were happy incl. President Clinton,Queen Beatrix etc.I usually do not react to comments from others,but to say ""all wrong"",is not right.CheersNettie"

","Beautiful facility, no personality","We stayed 3 nights in a private pool villa -it was stunning. The food was very average, and not for the health conscious. They did not provide very many vegetarian, sugar and gluten free options and when speaking with the staff it was incredibly difficult to make any adjustments. The resort, was pretty boring and we were ready to move on after 3 days... It seemed excessive and fake. The staff were very good but had been over-trained - so much so that they lacked personality and enthusiasm and I felt that they disliked their jobs. They were unhappy. It was not a joy to be around. Due to the location of the resort we could not travel easily to the local shops, and there was nowhere advertised to hire bikes or anything. I wouldn't stay here again."

","Beautiful Hotel","This hotel was the last stop on our honeymoon. The welcome we received was very warm and extra effort was made because we were newlyweds, which was amazing.We were lucky enough to get a pool villa, the pool was very well maintained and also quite large.The room had a shower that was partially outdoors which added to a very natural experience.We mostly used the restaurant serving Indonesian cuisine which was always very good value and very high quality, Maryam,Lea and Shahandi were always so helpful and friendly.The Spa was my wife and I's favourite spot in the hotel, we both had 5 treatments during our 7 night stay, with the shiatsu massage being a real highlight. The staff in the Spa were very good, Muhri and Fandy often gave us our treatments and they were always brilliant.It takes a bit of time to get used to the hard selling that goes on at the beach but the locals are still very friendly, and you barely notice after a day or so. The town of Sengiggi is a short taxi ride or a long walk from the hotel, but its a must visit, after dark it comes alive.We really enjoyed our time at Qunci Villas and our time in Lombok."

My husband and 2 young children stayed at Qunci Villas for 3 nights for our honeymoon at the beginning of June. The grounds are perfectly manicured, the ponds are crystal clear, the pools are so refreshing. You can tell that it is really well looked after and maintained. The staff were so wonderful and friendly, always smiling and nothing was ever too hard. We stayed in an upstairs partial ocean view room and it was beautiful, the view was spectacular. The restaurants were fantastic and the food was great. I simply could not fault it.

","Absolutely wonderful hotel and staff","I have never bothered to write a review here, though I often refer to trip advisor. I'm writing because I was so impressed with this hotel- I had been meaning to leave a review earlier. I stayed for 5 nights overs easter with 4 girlfriends in two partial ocean view rooms (don't let the name fool you- there was a great view right from our front door!). The hotel is so clean, the staff are wonderful- particularly the wait staff at the pool, the security, the gardeners and the staff at the spa. Everyone was so helpful with organizing activities and booking taxis. The 3 pools were amazing and the locals who sold their goods along the beach in front of the hotel were very friendly- go and say hello- we bought pearl jewelry, sarongs organized snorkelling out to the gillis and hired some surfboards! it's not Bali where you can be overwhelmed by hawkers- these are locals trying to make a living who are so friendly if you go and say hi.The location of the hotel is a few minutes by taxi to the main town where the restaurants are so you can't walk there but we didn't mind- there was more room and privacy at the resort and we had the best food of our trip at the 2 restaurants at the resort.The spa is lovely and I'd like to thank the staff there for doing a wonderful job, especially the young guy who (like all the staff) put up with me practicing my Indonesian and who looked after me when I cut my foot on coral!Again- terima kasih banyak atas teman2 dan saya untuk pengalaman yang paling baik di Lombok. All the staff should be congratulated for providing such helpful, friendly and curteous service. We can't wait to visit again. Katie"

","@home in paradise","We had a momentous occasion to celebrate â Andyâs 50th birthday and he chose Qunci as our venue. Andy is unquestionably the most adventurous traveler I know, and heâs been on every continent and almost every country on earth, yet he chose this out-of-the-way island and this special hotel to host his best friends and family to mark his semi-centennial. After spending over a week in this magical location I know why:1 â the staff are marvelous â engaged, knowledgeable and responsible, not to mention smiley and happy2 â the site is magical â drenched by the sun, soothed by ocean breezes and with a soundtrack of surf washing the beach3 â the grounds are modern â clean, comfortable, charming, green, tropical, palm trees, reflecting pools and ponds, sparkling pools fit for frolicking or even laps4 â the rooms are spacious, well appointed, comfortable, immaculate5 â the island is remote, filled with happy people, beautiful sites, rich history, surrounded by blue seas6 â the food and beverages are tasty, inventive and comforting all at the same time with unique cocktails and a fine selection of beer and wine accompanying Asian, continental and American treats that rival my own home town, San Francisco (and thatâs a high standard to match)Downsides? Ok, it takes a long time to get there, but itâs worth it. And, well, its not exactly the Silicon Valley when it comes to Internet connectivity â but thatâs not why you are there is it? Besides, the internet service works fine for email and surfing normal pages, but donât expect to stream your favorite tv shows in Lombok.Would I go again? YES and I'm looking for any excuse to join the staff of Qunci for another adventure soon! - Fred"

","Very Nice","Stayed for six nights in June 2013. All of the good things noted by many other reviewers are accurate, so I won't repeat them, except I will mention that the staff is very good. At the end of the week, we had an evening flight and check out from our room was at Noon. Hanging around the pool and the restaurant one more afternoon was nice and no problem. The resort graciously provided us with a room for an hour before we left for the airport, where we were able to take a shower and freshen up. However, the quality of that room was the only low point of the week. The shower had no hot water and the room was dark and unfurnished and it had the smell of sewage. I am inclined not to make much of this because the room was provided as a favor, but I would hope that paying guests are not put in that room. Our room for the six nights was an ocean view, second floor room, and it was excellent. I highly recommend paying the nominal extra amount for the ocean view. The calls to prayer mentioned by some reviewers were not a problem for us and we actually enjoyed listening to it."

","Paradise found","We spent 4 nights at Qunci Villa in room 55 an upstairs ocean front room with outdoor bathroom :) We flew across to Lombok from Bali and had pre arranged a pick up by the hotel. Aziz was waiting at the airport with a comfortable car, cold face washers and water much appreciated in the heat. The drive to QV was about 90 minutes. We were very pleased with the pick up service at a cost of $US 30 it represents good value for first time visitors. The check in was smooth and it soon became obvious that we had arrived in paradise, the gardens, the lighting, the atmosphere was truly calming and immediately relaxing. The room was superb with well proportioned spaces for bathing, dressing, sleeping and relaxing totally spotless and comfortable exceeding expectations. The service was faultless in all areas of the hotel. The staff were superbly trained and always available and attentive delivering on any request. A special thanks to lovely Lia who always went out of her way to please. The breakfasts were great I can recommend the 'healthy' option the fruit muesli and yogurt delicious! We were away from the resort for lunches and can recommend the Grill Fish Warung along the beach from the resort for some very local fare. We ate all dinners at QV and while I was always happy with my choices my husband felt some dishes were hit and miss. The surrounds and atmosphere were unbeatable. We booked the Gili Islands day trip through reception and was very happy with the arrangement including the provision of towels to take on the boat. The guide was excellent with assisting us to find the best place to snorkel off Gili Meno. I enjoyed three spa treatments - one facial and two foot reflexology. Thank you Fandy for the best foot reflexology ever. I quite enjoyed the interaction with the local hawkers who frequented the beachfront each day. The sun lounges were super comfortable and plentiful so no need to stress about moving about the resort and finding a comfortable place to rest. I couldn't stop taking photos of the amazing architecture, artwork and gardens. The atmosphere is tranquil and truly relaxing. I was in awe of the way QV has blended the natural environment with luxurious facilities and a superbly unpretentious feel. I loved our stay and could have stayed on and on....we will return.

","Good Food, Good Mood","After spending 2 nights in Bali, we came to Lombok and stayed in Qunci as honeymooners. We took room with the garden view, and yes the garden is beautiful, my wife really loves the landscape, architecture and all the antiques they put in this hotel. The ambiance of this hotel is very romantic, we enjoy our diner in the Asian Resto just by the beach. Me and my wife fell in love with the food served in this hotel. She ordered Gurami Fish and Mahi-mahi for me, first time we thought it was so expensive, but after tasting it, we really wanted to meet the chef and say thanks for his/her effort that made our food so delicious..then we thought it was fairly priced.. Staffs are great, they brought us a tv set but they did not tell us that our bathroom is not equipped with water gun near toilet to wash ourselves.Breakfast in front of the beach is very romantic as well and again the chef did give a great touch on his cuisine, we really like our meals.

","nice relaxing hotel","Stayed in qunci for 4 nights during family vacation with our our 1 daughters (was 6 and 1). Had hotel staff picking us ip right from airport which is an excellent service, a bit of journey to the hotel (single lane road, traffic) but totally worth it. Hotel is beautifully laid out, we took the partial sea-view room and it's pretty spacious with outdoor bathroom and a terrace. Helpfull and polite staff. Great view of the ocean and the daily night dance performance is just amazing. Breakfast option is good, but for lunch and dinner it's so so with an overrated price and not kid-friendly (as their version of french fries was actually made of purple sweet potato, so not actually a comforting holiday food). Overall athmosphere is very relaxing. Pool is nice, but then again not kid-friendly (no kiddie pool)."

","Quality Quinci","Had a wonderful 7nt stay in a partial sea view room here. Initially were a bit disappointed that we couldnât have a full week in one room with a full sea view but ours was only sited (more privately too) a little back and it meant you could still wake up in the morning and open the windows to hear and see the waves and birds from your bed âah bliss. In the end we spent so much time during the day next to the pools and beach and with darkness occurring early in this part of the world we rarely wanted to sit out in the evening anyway.Rooms were very pleasant and to our taste. Modern styling with a slight beach comber/hut feel. First time having an open (to the sky) bathroom area but with such consistently high temperatures day and night it was fun to shower and look up at the high branches of the palm trees above us. Just reluctant to turn on the light during the nocturnal visits in case it was a beacon for the mozzies!Learnt quickly that the staff were able to sort out your issues. So no TV in room â thatâs on requestâ and one installed with BBC news channel on our return. Have you an iron and board?- âthatâs on request- we will see if one is availableâ. Tea coffee making facility?- âthatâs on requestâ and kettle and cups etc appeared the next time.We also took advantage on several days of having our breakfeast delivered to the room at no extra cost- recommended for that extra laid back start to the day.Apart from the well tended and luxuriant gardens and plant beds that surround the rooms and other buildings, the quality hard landscaping and pool areas, the interesting architectural dining buildings and chairs there are innumerable statues and other art pieces dotted around which all add to making a relaxing stay for the mind/soul as well as the body. But where this destination wins is with the number of staff on hand whether in the breakfeast area or around the pool or bar and even more attending to cleaning and maintaining the property. All of them seemed so young but were all friendly talkative and very well mannered.Without taking anything away from QV we did try and eat out most times, there was a simple locally owned/run beach side cafÃ© just next door to the bar (Sasak CafÃ©) where we had several sunset meals â simple but very tasty and moderate prices. With a taxi ride into Senggigi so cheap we ate in a number of restaurants there too including the Square (more expensive but cheap by UK standards) where the style quality and taste of the meals were very high. We also purchased from the locals selling on the beach. Do find time to talk to them and at least think of a relative who would like a souvenir and give them some business/income. Also if you are in to learning to surf the local guys just next door are really friendly and know what they are doing so also could need supporting. Be aware that the sea is very strong here and there are no lifeguards or other safety systems that we are used to in the UK.Highly recommend QV for a lazy beachside break. Day out to the Gilli Isles easily done too."

","Honeymoon destination!","My wife and I have just returned from our 3 week honeymoon in Indonesia. Our last 8 days were spent at Qunci Villas and we found it was just what we needed. Fantastic service, polite and friendly staff, amazing food, and just a very relaxed atmosphere. If I had to nit-pick and find a slight draw back it would be that Qunci is a long way from any of the Lombok 'attractions' such as waterfalls and the beautiful beaches at the west of the island. Also, Sengiggi as a town/village is to be avoided. But back to Qunci itself, we found the level of service here beyond anything we have experienced in any other hotel we have visited. Nothing was too much trouble. Always plenty of sun loungers to sit on with fresh towels provided as often as you needed. 3 beautiful, spotlessly clean infinity pools. A great spa... Although I have to give some advice to men here.. If you are not too comfortable with being massaged by another man, make it very clear at the point of booking your treatment to avoid a very awkward moment! I had this little surprise tgrust on me when my wife and I went for our second couples massage. It was not mentioned that my masseur was a man until I had walked in the room and by then I felt it was too late and would seem rude to tell him to his face I didn't want him touching me. I pointed this discomfort out at the end of the massage to the management who were very understanding and offered me a complementary treatment like for like but with a female member of staff this time. This experience I think summed up Qunci. It is an amazing place and if you have any problem you just politely point if out to the staff and they will rectify it without question. I would recommend this place to any other potential honeymooners as we loved it and it is a very romantic place to be."

","Qunci Quite outstanding!!","Words cannot describe the level of luxury and service offered by this hotel. Today is our last day in Lombok and our experience has been one of sheer brilliance! Neither my partner nor I could come up with one 'brick bat' ! We are in a second level partial ocean view (room 35) and happy to be so. Ocean front villas though just as gorgeous would offer less privacy. Rooms immaculate, food is fresh and delicious, breakfasts are perfecto! Room service is fast and efficient. We were called a few nights ago to be informed our room service dinner would be a little longer as the restaurant was very busy. We were starving but appreciated the call .... 5 minutes later our meal arrived with free drinks and dessert! Yes..... The secret to great hotel service is to provide more than the guest is expecting and QV does this superbly. So value for money you might ask? I booked via Agoda, $150 night inclusive of breakfast. 3 restaurants, entree average $7, an expensive main $15, dessert $5....... Laughing!..... The Q staff are genuinely considerate, efficient and kind. I hope they are appreciated by the management ! We will return."

","Beautiful beachside resort","Just returned from a fantastic 3 nights at Qunci Villas. Such beautiful villas- Modern but with lots of character, spotless, spacious and perfect in almost every way. We stayed in a pool villa for 2 nights and a partial ocean view villa for our last night and both villas were lovely. The bed was exceptionally comfy with lovely linen (and I'm fussy about linen!). Loved the bathrooms. Only downside was no tv in room but not a huge issue and actually quite nice for a change. Villas are in a great location on the beach and only a few minutes to main Sengiggi on a motorbike, which the villa kindly organised for us. We loved the breakfast there..so many choices and all were so yummy. Staff were all very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Overall such a beautiful and relaxing place to stay. Would highly recommend to absolutely anyone. Hopefully we will be back in the not too distant future. Thank you Qunci!"

","Qlassy Qunci","We stayed at Qunci for 5 days as part of a holiday to Singapore and Lombok to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary. From previous TA reviews we were expecting high standards and we were not disappointed. We had an Ocean view room and we liked the clean fresh dÃ©cor and large balcony (which proved perfect for breakfast). The semi-open bathroom was also a welcome feature and any initial fears about this being a mozzie-magnet were misplaced. We took advantage of having a romantic dinner overlooking the beach and enjoyed an evening of good food and great service. In fact the service from everyone at Qunci was great. The staff all appear delighted to be working there and are happy to chat about their lives and learn more about their guests. The spa was particularly good and left me almost incoherent I was so relaxed.Downsides? The beach is fine but not great and the beach hawkers can get a bit tiresome after a while. Neither of there detracted materially from our stay at Qunci.I would fully recommend Qunci - we had a truly relaxing time there although there are plenty of options if you want to be more energetic."

","Ocean view breakfast","We stayed there only for 3 days from 03/06 on our honeymoon. When we arrived we knew that it will be a perfect place for our honeymoon. On the first night we had a romantic dinner near to the beach and it was very pleasant dinner for us, the foods taste are great and our desert also great. Next morning we decided to have breakfast in front of the ocean instead of in the restaurant and it was a fabulous view, we donât want to finish our breakfast quickly. Nova GRO came along and offered us a day trip to Giliâs, lucky us he has a friend who have a boat since we have to book a night before from the hotel. The second night after we had our dinner, me and my wife swam in one of the pool (they had 3 pools facing to ocean) and the pool belongs to us only. Management should consider is, Please change the size of your mineral water from small one at least to medium size. In the night when we asked for additional mineral water, the reception said the mineral water only provided 2 per day in the morning. It disappointing even thought they brought it at last. On the way back we had a transportation to airport, considering a long way from hotel to airport, you should place a amenities inside such as cookies, cold towel, mineral water, etc. We also had a massage treatment for a couple and it would be nice if you have a optional for oil massage so guest can choose which aroma they want.Overall, we definitely will come back in a near future. The place was beautiful."

","Excellent Property","We enjoyed our 2 night stay at Qunci Villas. The resort is absolutely beautiful. You have to see them yourself to appreciate the beauty of the settings. We could spend the whole evening spending time at the poolside just enjoying the view. The room are huge, the outdoor shower are huge too. We love the outdoor shower as it feels that you are taking a bath in nature. One negative point is that our room #17 seems to be quite dated, some of the rooms that i passed on the way to the lobby seems much nicer in comparison. But we spent most of our time by the poolside and not in the room anyway, so it wasn't much of a big issue.The staffs are great and helpful too, they will take care of all your needs.We dined twice at the restaurant. Out of the 6 dishes that we ordered throughout our stay, only 3 dishes that i would consider great, the other 3 are average. The price of the food is reasonable for such a beautiful resort though. The breakfast is great and the view from the breakfast table is amazing.I would highly recommend Qunci Villas to those of you visiting Lombok."

","Superb all round hotel","Stayed here for 10 days after a few days in Bali . We had a sea veiw room which was worth the extra cost but all rooms are spacious . Staff are numerous and very attentive and helpful .Plenty of sun beds /day beds etc so no need to rise early and spread your towel . No beach to speak of but the waves come up to the front of the pool areas so it feels like you are on the beach but without the sand and hawkers .Breakfasts are an excellent choice to suit all tastes with plenty of fruit which suited us . We only had one evening meal which was good but a little pricey by local standards plus we like to explore for our meals . The real gem is a beach cafe /restuarant just along the beach (Sengigi direction ) run by some locals ,they buy their fish in the morning from the local fishing boats and serve a wonderful meal in the evening with tables on the beach ,they are happy for you to take own cocktails etc if you want more than local beers .On a meal for two you get change out of Â£10 (honest )There are also a few nice restuarant in Sengigi which is easy to access by taxi or bus"

","Best Spa experience ever","We are still enjoying our honeymoon here but I wanted to do a separate review on Qunci Villas SPA.It is to die for, so professional and friendly. We booked the Qamboja (name of SPA) special. Welcome drink, cold towel with mint aroma - already so relaxing. Foot wash with flowers, feet are massaged and scrubbed with bim stone.The spa menu is extensive and the Qamboja Special gives you the chance to pick from four massage types (aroma, balinese, swedish and traditional) and a body wrap/or body scrub.We were given a couple room since my husband and I had the treatment at same time.I chose the aromatic massage (you can chose from ten different massage oils, I chose Patchoulli, very nice)This was the best massage I ever enjoyed! I asked the lady for a soft massage as I easily bruise and she did a wonderful job.I chose the coconilla body scrub which was made of freshly shredded coconut. A body moisturizer (fresh coconut milk, thick) was applied also. The Qamboja Special also includes a bath, you can chose between a flower bath and a spicy bath. The spices were absolutely amazing, body lotion (citronella) is provided afterwards. Price for this treatment is 50$ p.P treatment and lasts 2 hours. I think it is worth the money. We tipped the two massage staff as we were so content with their work and asked for their availability for the coming couple spa experience in some days.The hotel also offers massages at the pool, probably for less money, however I would highly recommend to try Qunci's Spa!"

","Gem in Lombok","Definitely a right choice that I have made in choosing Qunci Villas Hotel, Lombok. Lombok is a blooming flower in the making. It is currently an off peak season, yet it is still fully booked. We stayed 2 nights at Ocean View room (ground floor) and 2 nights at Partial Ocean View room (upper floor). Both room types are fantastic though we prefer upper floor for more privacy. Took the hotel private charter boat to all 3 Gili Isles, just the 2 of us. 2 Thumbs up! We totally enjoyed our breakfast, outdoor facing the ocean. Served ala carte and really spoilt for choices. Eggs Benedict & Canadian Lumberjack are strongly recommended. Awesome & attentive staffs! You have got to love them! Lastly, we are coffee drinkers and back home in Singapore, Artisan Coffee is in trend. If they could bring in better roasted coffee beans from different origins, that would seal it all! Once again, Thank You Qunci Villas Hotel and hope to be back again soon, not just 2 of us but 3 or 4, with our l'il ones in the making..."

","Just loved it!","I arrived to the Qunci after 4 days of exhausting trekking on Gunung Rinjani. I really loved the ambience of the resort. I stayed in room #27 which is looking onto the Bali sea. I enjoyed very much the porch and the lovely view. Breakfast is great. The restaurants serve delicious and, for the standard of the Qunci, rather reasonably priced food. When next time in Lombok, I will definitely return."

","First class hotel, first class service in a beautiful location. A*","This hotel is strikingly beautiful, both the location and the architecture of the place culminate to make a truly beautiful island retreat.If you are torn between Bali and Lombok like we were, go to Lombok and stay here. Lombok is a nicer island which is less developed than Bali but is all the better for it. We spent some time in Bali before we went to Lombok and to be honest, I was ready to go home and was crushingly disappointed, until we got to Lombok where this hotel and the island in general blew me away. Rooms: We had a normal room and it was beautiful. The outside bathroom was different but it was really good, absolutely private and with a lovely cool shower and somewhere to hang clothes and swimming stuff to dry. Fresh towels when you want them, soap and shampoo supplied. The room itself had a very large double bed and all of the furniture was made of beautiful hardwood.Pools: The have 3 beautiful infinity pools lined with natural stone and of a good length (25m I would guestimate). There is an adults only pool for the busy summer months when there are kids about, but we went in may and all three pools were always sparsely populated and good for either a swim or a chill out.Food: The food was very good, whatever your tastes may be. Western and local food is available and absolutely everything we tried was really good and very reasonably priced too. Do yourself a favour - if you only ever try one local dish, make it the beef rendang at this hotel - I lived on the stuff and loved it.Staff: Were great. Other hotels in Bali we stayed in on this trip had staff who acted more like servants and I hate that. Here however, the staff were polite and would happily talk to you and chat, they were far more amiable and always had a big smile. A waitress named Evi in particular was great to chat to and always remembered your face and was ready with a smile and advice on anything you asked her about the island.In short, I loved this place, its how apple would do a hotel. If you only ever go to one place in South East Asia, make it here."

","Luxury for 105$/day","Qunci is pure luxury at affordable price. Everything is perfect: the infinity pool is jaw dropping, the delucious room with the openair bathroom are out of this world. Super clean and each room has a balcon and/or patio. I stayed in the cheapest room but I was given an upgrade to ocean view room. Breakfast is included but not tax (21%). Even if there is no availability on their website try to call them, often they have some rooms free. The only downside is you need a kind of transportation to go there, walking from Sengiggi is not an option, it's too far. I strongly recommend this place."

","Beautiful experience","Qunci is a beautifully designed place -- they have very smartly expanded so it's large but never feels crowded. There are many places to hang out and enjoy the views, three beach-side pools -- one for adults only -- all artistically and thoughtfully landscaped. The staff is very friendly, the spa fantastic and the food very good.The room was small but comfortable and clean, and the outdoor shower is amazing. I was very happy here and ended up extending my stay.The beach is nice and pretty clean here, and the resort is located right next to a spot where you can charter a trimaran to the gilis if you feel the need a change of scenery. After 5 days, i could have happily stayed longer."

","I would go back in a second","I've been meaning to write this review for a long time. I am usually really detailed in my reviews but all I need to say was that it was absolutely amazing. I have never ever felt so welcomed and so looked after as I was here. We started off in a pool villa for 4 nights then were very sad to leave. However, we were gone for less than 24 hours because when we arrived back in Bali we realised the only place we wanted to be was Qunci. Luckily they had a beach villa which they managed to let us stay in for the other 5 nights we had there.Happy hour was amazing, we definitely used it every night. Staff were so unbelievably nice. I wrote down all their names so I could put them in here but in the end it was all of them so I don't need to single anyone out. Beautiful pools, beautiful food (except the BBQ which I have to say wasn't the best...). I never go back to the same hotels twice but I wouldn't hesitate to go back here. Please can I come back now??I could go on but I won't. Best hotel I've ever stayed in, nicest staff I've ever had the pleasure of meeting, lovely lunches, cleanliness was superb, 10 out of 10 for everything."

The rooms are cosy and clean, they do everything to make you feel good: flowers on the table, every day fresh fruit, cold towels and icewater on the pool - my husband went for 3 days to the Rinjani, staff cared for me, my mom couldn't do it better.....it was hard to went back home, but we'll come back next year - SURE !

","Luxury on Lombok","My son and family live in Jakarta and we visit each winter. There is always time for us to visit another island and see the sights. Lombok has become one of our favorite places and the Qunci Villas has to be one of the most beautiful hotels in the world. The villas are traditional and have beautiful native art and showers open to the sky. They all had balconies and many had private pools. It was had to leave to explore the grounds because our villa was so awesome. The grounds were a work of art themselves. Trees were carved as totems, flowers were everywhere, and the beach was a dream! Meals were served outdoors or even on the beach. The waiters were courteous and helpful and the food was excellent. We had drivers to visit the sights and rented a glass bottom boat to go out to the gullies (smaller islands) and swim. This was all arranged by the hotel. Lombok is smaller and less busy than Bali. You can sit on the beach and watch the sun sat over a volcano on Bali and relax at the end of another day in paradise. I highly recommend the Qunci Villas Hotel for anyone who just wants to get away. It is idyllic."

","Gorgeous getaway","Our plan was to stay in Qunci as a transit for 2 days before going to Gili Meno. Qunci exceeded our expectations in every way. The services, the hospitality, the room, the food. Everything you can wish for in a perfect holiday, you have it in Qunci. It was so good that our stay in Gili Meno was, by comparison, disappointing and we cut short that stay to return one more night in Qunci before returning home. We will be back soon, this is a promise to ourselves :)"

","Magnificent resort in a magical location!","My wife and I decided that we had to escape the madness of Bali so we flew over to lombok, jumped in a taxi and told the driver to take us to Senggigi. On the way there we called up Qunci to check that they had availability. Lucky for us they did and we arrived about an hour later. We checked in to a partial ocean view and the room was excellent!! The hotel has numerous infinity pools which all look out over the ocean. The hotel also faces west so sipping awesome cocktails while in the pool looking at the sunset was magical. There are also 3 restaurants to choose from so we were spoilt for choice. They even arranged for our transfers to Gili Trawangan which I thought was great and very reasonably priced. I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody looking for a nice quiet break. Great service, great food, great drinks, great location."

The design of the entire resort draws from the natural surroundings and is gorgeous. Loved the outdoor shower. Add to that the breathtaking view across the sea, watching the sun set over Bali's volcano. But what made Qunci a unique experience was the intimacy of the property...individual villas, the open yet secluded dining areas, swimming pools and to-die-for spa (including to-die-for treatments). The staff provided exceptionally professional service, yet their warmth made me feel at home. Always ready with a smile. Thank you Luhur, Dia, Riya and Lia!

","A great 24hrs","A lovely stay.Best part? Room with ocean view, tasty food, but most of all fantastic (and smiley) service from staff!Worst part? Nothing really. Perhaps the lack of activities (availability of watersports) however surfboards + lessons are available next door.Hawkability (3/5): The massage kiosk on the beachfront is periodically overwhelmed by hawkers. To the bystander it's an amusing sight to behold where massager is in conversation with massagee, massagee is fighting off hawker #1 and #2 selling bracelets whilst hawkers #3 to #6 selling sarongs, hammocks and tshirts wait in the wings. Relaxing?Â The middle of the hotel beachfront is clear of hawkers though as the waves wash them away."

But, once you are in the Villa, you can feel that you are in your deluxe home. I loved the SPA where have wonderful massage, Great body therapy, and the exotic local herb tea. I loved breakfast system, not too much but very private and healthy. Well trained staffs. They have excellent room (restaurant, bar, swimming pool, spa, sport etc) service. They organize the wedding, birthday celebration a la carte. They also organize outside sports actives such as biking, hiking, etc. They have the wonderful diners such as sea foods BBQ, Asian or western food a la carte. Qunci Villas invites the absolute value artistes to make the decoration in each room and each space. You are walking in a museum. If you are a surfer, you will enjoy the place. Itâs the place where you can get a real mental health break and do some nice family time in an excellent pool with good food, drink and scenery natural, Qunci Villas Lombok is the place to go.

","Qunci Villas Lombok","My husband, son (age 6) and myself spent about 5 nights here a week ago. We were there for a birthday celebration. We really loved it. The rooms are beautiful, the entire place is aesthetically pleasing, and the place is utterly relaxing. The food is excellent--mixed menu. I love Indonesian food, but it's still good to have different foods to choose from on a holiday. I'm a foodie--so I don't say excellent food unless it is so. The infinity pools, beach, and outdoor activity and things to see offered lots for my son to do. Some people like those kids clubs, so if you are one of those families, this isn't for you. It's not a kiddy resort--which actually, I would appreciate if I were childless and now even with a child, still appreciate. Our son is a great swimmer and we are not the Disneyland or Nusa Dua type of family (no offense if you are) so he was loathe to leave. I loved that there was no television in our room. It allows for true relaxation. Spa was fab. I fell asleep during a manicure:) Massage killer good. Yoga instructor was very good too. He knew how to run a class for mixed levels. I was impressed. Superb holiday. Well-trained staff. I also liked that there wasn't this tinkling tourist music playing everywhere. The gamelan music--at the end of my stays in Bali it made me want to clobber someone. Gloriously absent. I have already recommended this place to several frequent Bali-holiday goers. If you are a wild party animal who craves city action you should head to Bali. If you want a real mental health break from modern life and need to unwind, read a book, enjoy a sunset and do some nice family time in an excellent pool with good food, drink and scenery--natural and art-filled, Qunci Villas Lombok is the place to go. I recommend this place."

","Excellent service, breathtaking views, attention to detail","This is one of the nicest places I have ever stayed. Ever.The staff is courteous, friendly and eager to assist - always with a smile on their faces. The location is stunning, right across the Bali Sea to a view of Mount Agung Volcano rising majestically in the distance. It looks like the backdrop from a set of South Pacific and I have little doubt that the inspiration for Bali Hai was taken from this view. This is one of the most beautiful places you'll ever stay - relax by the huge infinity pool, have breakfast overlooking the beach, wander the beautifully landscaped grounds. The rooms are immaculate with an attention to detail which is actually quite amazing. A wonderful surprise awaits you in the architecture of your bathroom as well. Construction is solid and wholly soundproofed.Prices are shockingly reasonable and the owner often makes an appearance in the hotel - not that he needs to because his highly responsible manager runs a very tight ship.My one quibble is with the setup of some of the ""Garden VIew"" Rooms which front right on to the path with huge picture window doors - giving you less privacy. However after a day or so one realizes that it is a bit of an illusion - the vegetation ""screen"" in front provides a much larger amount of privacy than you'd expect and you're really not all that visible. I had to call several times to people passing outside before they could even locate where the call was coming from."

","Absolutely stunning and the best service!!","Beautifup Lombok and Qunci is the gem of Lombok. We chose Qunci for our 10 yrs anniversary celebration for 4 days from 8/05 - 11/05 and really wished that we could extend. In fact back to reality now i can still imagine being in Qunci... Beautiful hotel settings although i do wish they have an electric kettle and water hose/pipe installed by the toilet bowl . Comfortable rooms with balcony and beautiful arts. I took photo of every art piece in the room. The main features is the Infinity pool.. It is really gorgeous and the romantic. Thanks Luhur for serving us well at dinner and Kamila for the best relaxing massage. (Did i get her name right?) Am so Sorry if its wrong cus am too dazed by the great aromatic massage. Great relaxing facial too.. i fell asleep on that one not because its boring but just too relaxing.And i must say each every guy staff at the reception has the most genuine smile.

","Two Thumbs Up from me and Two more from my husband","Me and my husband spend 3 nights at Qunci during our honeymoon last week.We stayed at the Qumbang Villa (one bedroom villa with private pool, mini kitchen, two bathrooms, and also a TV!). Qumbang's location is separated from the main location of Qunci, so we were provided by a shuttle car to access the beach villa.Actually, I was a little bit afraid when I book Qunci villa, since it's a little bit up way our budget.But I could say that it worth every penny.The service is excellence.Since the booking, until the check out time, I feel content and satisfied.Every time I need something, the staffs are really helpful.Even when I only asked to deliver the mosquito repellent refill, they spare to clean up our bed.That's a small gesture, but it is nice.The hotel atmosphere is also great.The hotel is allowing children, but I didn't feel annoyed since the hotel's surrounding is too much to be enjoyed.Oh, and don't forget about the breakfast menu. You have to try the Egg Benedict. That's absolutely delicious.We feel very relaxed during our stay there.And we feel it's really hard to leave Qunci.It's definitely a place that would stay long in our memory."

","Beautiful, well managed, service oriented luxury!","Upon arriving at the Qunci Villas it was quite apparent that this was a quality hotel. Beautifully kept grounds and service oriented staff greeted us. We could have stayed an extra day or two beyond our two nights in this beautiful hotel. Service was perfect without being overwhelming. Spa services were reasonable and extremely pleasurable delivered by knowledgeable staff. My wife thoroughly enjoyed the spa experience. The pools were perfect and we didn't have any trouble getting lounges or extra towels. One of our more memorable events were the evening dinners right on the beach...well, as close as you could get. The food was well prepared by very knowledgeable chefs...the food was the barometer! The breakfasts were especially superb and the dinners on the beach by candlelight made this stay a romantic, memorable event. My wife bought a great purse and some gifts at the hotel gift shop that had a variety of gifts at very reasonable prices. Senggigi is a small, hospitable town but not much of a tourist area. You do have to arrange trips out of the area because there's not much to see or do besides the local Art Market. Because of the quality of the hotel, we were comfortably and restfully nurtured by the beauty of the beach and outstanding sunsets. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and appreciated the attentiveness of staff who attended to our needs and requests. I can't complain of any facet of our stay at the Qunci Villas. I'll book again when I go back."

","All the Praise is Deserved","Of our ten week travels through SE Asia, we only had five days for Lombok, and just three of them for Quinci Villas. That proved to be quite insufficient. Lombok is a memorable island, and Quinci Villas is the jewel in the crown. While at the top of our accommodation budget, it proved to be excellent value.Our friends had praised Quinci a few years earlier, but that did not adequately prepare us for the idyllic experience we enjoyed. When we contacted them on Skype, describing the property and sharing video, they were amazed at the expanded facilities so seamlessly incorporated in just a couple of years.The staff went out of their way to decorate our room with orchids for our anniversary. My wife was overwhelmed and carries the memory as the high point of our second honeymoon. Attention to detail is evident in every aspect of the Quinci experience. I could have taken hundreds of photos trying to capture design details in the structures, landscaping, furnishings, food presentations, everything. Add to that the compelling view of Bali's highest peak directly off the beach and there is magic everywhere.There are a few instances where, in my view, a little functionality is sacrificed for artistic interests. This was the first time I had experienced an entire bathroom, not just the shower, open to the elements. Great ventilation, but given the hot & humid weather the entire room was usually a sauna compared to the air-conditioned bedroom. The use of stone slab walkways makes rolling luggage a noisy and potentially damaging operation. Flat stone paths around the restaurants look wonderful, but I avoided them whenever possible. They can never be spaced properly for all strides. Perhaps I should just slow my pace and smell the hibiscus. You see how picky I had to be to avoid providing nothing but praise? Others have mentioned the early morning call to prayer from the neighboring mosque. While it did awaken us before sunrise, it was more melodic and unobtrusive than other encounters in Muslim locales. If it might be a problem for you, consider requesting a room farther from the road.Special mention must be made to the food. The a la carte breakfasts were wonderful. My wife is an excellent cook and makes terrific Eggs Benedict. She ordered theirs every day! Perfect every time with a true, but light Hollandaise. I was all over the map and delighted with my choices. Lunches and dinners at both restaurants were excellent value. In Lombok, and elsewhere in Indonesia, alcohol taxation makes cocktails a luxury. A cocktail can cost more than dinner.Overall, this is a well thought out resort displaying continuous attention to detail. Just look at the review comments posted by Scott, no matter where in the world he may be. These are not form responses - he listens and learns. Well done, sir."

","The entire stay was stunning","Quinci Villas is the most relaxing hotel I have ever stayed in. I stayed in an Ocean View room for 8 nights and will definitely book an ocean view again- the deck is very large with comfortable outdoor furniture so my partner and I spent enough time there relaxing and watching the ocean to make this more than worth it. The room is spacious with a huge bed, beautifully decorated and thoughtfully laid out. I love the open-air bathroom with the rainfall shower.Every staff member that we encountered were very friendly and genuine- from the staff in the spa, to the bar staff and waiters, to the staff on the front desk, nothing was too much trouble. The staff make the place. The bar staff in particular were hilarious. As a side note, I cannot understand reviewers writing in to complain that there was no television/bottled water/other trivial item when I am sure they would have been asked many times a day if they were enjoying their stay, if there was anything the staff member could do for them... Honestly, I asked if I could come and collect a kettle and teabags to keep in our room, and it was brought around- with an enourmous fruit platter and a huge smile.Quali, Quah and NooQ all have delicious food, particularly the seafood at Quali. We also had a fantastic seafood BBQ on the beach one night which I definitely wouldn't miss. The cocktails are fantastic and varied, and while I have read complaints about the wine list I actually find it quite reasonable for Indonesia and Lombok in particular. I found the spa are to be very soothing and felt truly taken care of the moment I walked in. If you are sunburnt, go to them, they have a miracle wrap for that and it saved me from a very uncomfortable couple of days. We also organised a private day tour through the hotel to the Gili Islands which was fantastic. Other things I love- the coffee. That there is an adults-only pool. That breakfast is a set breakfast for you to have anywhere you like, and not a buffet breakfast. That it all looked better in real life than in the photos."

","An unforgettable vacation!","There are not many places where you want to come for a second time, but Qunci Villas is definitely one of them! Our whole stay much exceeded our expectations. The staff is extremely friendly, the cook is amazing, the athmosphere idyllic, the spa is the best I've ever had in Asia.We had a villa with a garden view, which was perfectly ok, I suppose sea view is even better :) There are three big swimming pools, Asian and European food, variety of breakfasts, and a bar. Water is served all the day for free. The staff is making small surprises all the time - flowers here and there, fruits on the table in front of the room, really impressive! If you are interested in the culture, they can answer all your questions about Lombok, the people, etc.The single annoying thing was the aircon in the rooms - it is situated in such a way, that it blows directly over your head while sleeping. Maybe it could be repositioned in a better place.If you go to Lombok, do not hesitate at all and go for Qunci Villas! I am sure that I will go there again!"

","We'll Be Back - Qunci Villas","We returned to Qunci villas for 8 nights in September 2012, and it once again met and exceeded all our expectations. The staff are genuinely friendly, and it was pleasant how many staff remembered us from the year earlier, when we hosted our wedding there with 30 guests. This visit, the new villas that we saw the year earlier being constructed where all finished along with the new Day spa. It was surprising to see how seamless all the new villas and landscaping blended into the two existing properties.We stayed in the Qusia 3 Bedroom Villa up on the hill again, and couldnât fault a thing. Itâs a fantastic property and lying around the infinity pool couldnât have been any more relaxing.The butlers were great and the chef once again cooked up a storm for us. We also tried both restaurants, and the food was excellent.Qunci certainly gives a 5 star service for a 4 star price, and to the credit of the staff and to the owner Scott, who goes above and beyond.We already booked to stay again for a week this coming September.Ps.

","Phenomenal commanding view of Mt Agung @ idyllic Quinci Villas","We chose this extremely beautiful, serene tranquil setting to spend our last day/night in Indonesia and it was a perfect end to our stay. By day we relaxed by the angelic infinity pool that spills over to ocean views. Quinci friendly staff saw to our every need. Iced water with a twist of lime was served to pool quests frequently, and later in the afternoon they served us fruit sticks. And whilst the sun was going down over Lombok Strait Quinci Happy Hours from 5-7pm (Buy one get one free) was a terrific way to see Mt Agung dominate the night sky amonst the brilliant sunset we witnessed. Everyone has a budget, we paid twice the price of where we were staying in Senggigi and boy... are we glad we lashed out on the last night. Quinci has given us lasting memories of a stunning sunset and some very happy hours at this Travellers Choice Tripadvisor award winning resort.Our room (No.14 GardenView) was exactly as you would expect in this 5 star dazzler.Management attempted to get our ANZAC AFL match for us, but in the end we listened to the BIG game by the pool (we got a late check-out 3pm). We did receive a small reduction on our tariff for not delivering on their promise of Sports TV channel.

","Good but not excellent","Stayed at QV for three nights last week. The rooms are comfortable but the lay out leaves little privacy. We were on the ground floor with 'partially view to the sea' (no view at all) had to keep blinds down at all times as paths were busy, neighbours on both sides were heard and seen. There are two beautiful large pools but everyone seems to be sitting round and inevitably steering at all times which makes you feel uncomfortable. Lots of traders offering you goods when sitting facing the beach. Breakfast was okay but very small portions. You only get the choice of one out of five, if an extra juice or coffee is needed you are charged for it extra. As a whole not really value for money. Later on moved to Novotel in Kuta and that was much better. Had planned two nights there and stayed for a whole week as views, tranquility, breakfast and comfort full fill our expectations."

","So good stayed an extra day","It's funny to me that on the Qunci website and on Facebook, etc. most of the photos of the hotel don't have people in them, when it's the people that make all the difference! From Nova at the front desk, who makes a point of memorizing the name of absolutely every single person staying on the property so he can greet you by name!, to Maria, the best dinner waitress ever, the people working here are what really put this place over the top and make it so outstanding.Rooms are nice and good value for the price. I've stayed here a couple of times now and from what I can tell, the room classifications: ""garden"" ""partial ocean view"" ""ocean view"" have more to do with the proximity to the ocean and not whether they actually really have any kind of view. (In other words, it may not be worth paying extra for a 'view' when you're not necessarily going to actually get a view, just a room that's a few feet closer to the ocean.) For instance Room #79 which I believe is considered ""partial ocean view"" has no possible view of the ocean at all, whereas Room #12 which I believe is ""garden view"" (I didn't stay in this room, my friends did) ended up being our 'hang out' spot because the huge lanai had a magnificent full view of the ocean. Last time I also checked out the large villas with private pools--they're really beautiful and romantic, but do not have ocean views.The pools here are really nice and well-maintained. The ocean is a bit rough. It's not bad for easy surfing actually, but not always ideal for swimming.Food at the restaurant was excellent. They've built out 2 or 3 different bars or restaurants, but when we were there they all seemed to be serving the same thing. As others have mentioned, it's a bit pricey for the area, but I didn't think exorbitant for the quality I was getting (and still less than I'd be paying in Jakarta.) Especially good was the whole fish special at lunch time. Also, breakfast is a civilized affair: no buffet, which I appreciated (although some might miss the customary Indonesian hotel breakfast with typical Western dishes AND nasi goreng...here it's either/or.) The tuna omelet was made with fresh tuna...end of story...Those of you expecting the typical South Asia beach scene, it doesn't really exist here. (i.e. you can't really hang out in your luxury hotel all day and then hit the beach to eat/drink with the riff-raff at night.) There are basically only 2 other dining options within walking distance...walk down to the beach and turn left and a few hundred yards away is the Warung Paradiso, which has excellent simple fish and squid and cold beer...a few hundred yards further on is The Ballroom restaurant, owned by a former world Ballroom Dancing champion which is bizarre, expensive, and also pretty good. Otherwise, there are a bunch of restaurants huddled around the small art market and club strip in the center of town...As for drinks: they're very expensive here. Even the half-price happy hour drinks (which sadly do not include beer and wine) were about the same price as full-price drinks elsewhere. In fact, the mixed drinks here are the most expensive we saw anywhere on Lombok.2 other small quibbles: 1) windows in the rooms don't open, or if they do, there are no screens. Which forces you to use the air conditioner even though on most nights it's cool enough that you wouldn't need it. (And the first night you're going to spend half the night up adjusting the aircon so it's not too hot, not too cold, etc.) The only option would be to leave the door to your room wide open (which I wouldn't recommend, even though the resort seems to do an excellent job of fogging for mosquitos.) 2) It would be nice if they provided a cotton robe of some kind for sleeping or even wearing out to the pool."

","A slice of paradise","We had a fantastic stay at Qunci villas - a wonderful place to unwind and relax.The staff were all very cheerful and helpful and were all very accommodating. Our room was lovely and the pools/sunbathing areas very pleasant and well-lmaintained. All the food was superb and we enjoyed delicious cocktails at sunset every evening.We stayed in Qunci with our 10 month baby - all the staff were so friendly to him, and we had a great holiday as a family. We took a travel cot, but I believe the villas also had great wooden cots. We were also provided with a baby bath and highchairs were readily available in the restaurants. Was a really easy vacation with a baby."

","Stay here!!! Whatever your budget!","I have been traveling through Asia for about 20 years (total of more than 2 years in Asia). I have probably stayed in 400+ hotels/guesthouses over that time (ranging from the Oberoi in Delhi to little/cheap B&B's around the world). This hotel, without a doubt, is my favorite hotel I have ever visited. And is far & away the best value of any hotel imaginable. There are too many positives to list but I'll try to hit the high-points in no particular order. --The lawns are perfectly manicured and beautiful--I love the way the whole pool interior is covered in stone (including the bottom)--The service by the staff is fantastic. They are so sincere/nice. I couldn't believe how many people remembered our names and even little preferences. The staff all seem very happy and are surely handpicked and well-trained for their jobs. --We listened to a really good band on Thursday night. Great variety of music and quite talented. --They didn't have a name for their band, but the lead singer was named John Walker (from Lombok though his name might not have indicated that)--The artwork in the rooms and throughout the common areas was SO tastefully done and enjoyable. We had a giant painting in our room (room 72) that was fantastic. --One of my favorite things were the furnishings. I used to own an import store and have an eye for good Balinese/Indonesian furnishings. The pieces selected were perfect for the hotel (teak-root benches, tamarind benches & stools, stone tables, etc, etc). --I loved the many ponds/fountains throughout the resort (especially the large stones in the bottoms. --The resort is beautiful during the day but is even more spectacular at night. The fixed lighint is perfect and the accent pieces (candles and such) are wonderful. --The breakfasts were delicious. I liked the many options on the breakfast menu.--The restaurants were delightful. We were on a budget so we didn't partake in the higher ticket items, but what we had was fantastic. The restaurants are by no means exorbitantly priced. Quite reasonable, in fact. If, however, you are on a really tight budget there is a restaurant about 3 meters north of the property that is very good and quite cheap. Though we only ate there for one meal, I'd recommend it quite highly. --The showers in the bathrooms were perfect! The only downside has little to do with the resort. Bali/Lombok has a number of touts on the beaches. They live on a very small income and peddle their goods to the guests at hotels/restaurants/resorts/etc. It's not pleasant and surely most guests would wish they would not have to regularly tell people ""no thank you, I don't need another sarong."" That said, on the beach of Qunci the peddlers are quite polite and don't press all that much. They pretty quickly got the idea that we didn't want a massage or to buy any goods. We had some nice conversations with them and it got to the point where they merely wished us a good morning or good day... I was a little surprised that they sometimes climbed up onto the deck of the resort instead of being on the beach below, but it was understandable when the tide got high. [note: I really respect the right of all people to use the beach instead of privatizing the beaches. Dealing with the hawkers is tiresome at times (more so at other hotels, mind you) but the beach should really belong to everyone.] One more thing I'd like to see in the future is for Qunci to start using more efficient features at the resort. Possibly starting with some lower-wattage bulbs (CFBs or LEDs). I think it would make the bottom line bigger and more importantly do what's right for the island. We have a travel/tour company and will surely send/bring people to Lombok in the future. Though we can't always afford to stay every night at Qunci, we will surely scrimp/save to be able to stay here periodically. Everyone should, no matter what your budget! I was proud to be from the USA (not always the case throughout my travels). When we told staff at the resort where we were from, they ALWAYS proudly informed us that Scott (the owner of Qunci) is from the USA. Well I hope to have the opportunity to meet him someday and tell him thank you for the opportunity to stay at such a wonderful place. I have uploaded a bunch of photos of our room and the grounds. They are superfluous to what exists on TripAdvisor and the Qunci Villas website. Nonetheless, I thought I'd add more... I've looked at the few negative comments on TripAdvisor and can wholeheartedly say that they can be discounted outright. Just book your room here and enjoy your stay! I promise you will!"

","Amazing!!","We stayed at this resort last week - it was our first trip to Lombok and my first visit to Indonesia in 26 years. This place is amazing - our 1 bed villa with the pool was great. The staff cleaned the pool every day and sprayed our rooms for mosquitos every night. The resort is spotless, the food and drinks are fantastic and the spa experiences were to die for. They also arrange different dinner/events through the week and you can arrange romantic dinners on the beach. My kids had so much fun and all the staff are so helpful, friendly and professional - I will definitely be coming back here again and will recommend it to all my friends. Just one suggestion if I may - would be great if Qunci had a kids club just for a few activities(eg shell finding, sand castle builsing) and would love to see a drying rack in the room so when we rinse our bathers we can hang out to dry!!"

","Fantastic","On friends recommendations we stayed here for a week after 3 1/2 weeks of travelling around Indonesia. We had one of the private pool rooms with the outdoor shower. It was all very clean and comfortable, stylishly furnished. Having the private pool is great as there were quite a few families with children, when it got a little noisy we could retreat to our pool. The pool is not completely private, there are wide gaps that look into the pool areas of a few of this style of room/pool. The hawkers are constantly trying to sell which can get a little tiring, but they do not come onto the resort grounds.Food was good and reasonably priced, although I was a little shocked at paying nearly $12 for two coffees. Happy hour lasts for two hours and cocktails are 2 for 1, sitting by one of the main pools with a Long Island Iced Tea watching the sunset was a great way to end the day before dinner. I would definitely go back.A word of warning, if you head over to Lombok on one of the fast boats, make sure you have arranged a pick up by Qunci Villas. We did, but another couple didn't and the arrangement amongst the locals is that if a pick up has not been arranged then the resort can not transport you. You have to pay the locals to drive you.The Spa was good, but the massage rooms are not completely relaxing as you can hear the treatment in the next room word for word.Overall Qunci Villas was great and we would love to stay again."

","Paradise- didn't want to leave!","My husband and I booked Qunci Villas based on previous trip advisor reviews and we were not disappointed! The location and setting of the hotel is superb- I especially loved sitting by one of the three infinity pools having lunch or a cold drink. Cocktail hour every night from 5 til 7pm was a real hit! We tried the tapas menu a few times and it was so tasty and first class in presentation. We also ate at both restaurants at Qunci and the meals were delicious! V impressed with quality and price. Finally all the previous reviews about the friendliness and efficiency of the staff are 100% accurate! Without fail they were all a credit to the hotel it was a delight staying here! Can't wait to come back xx"

","An Idyllic Retreat in the middle of nowhere","We went to Qunci Villa on the back of friends' recommendations. The villa itself lived up to its reputation. Clean, idyllic, relaxing and surprisingly good food! Of course, all these came at a price. Expect to spend at least USD20 per meal every time, not expensive in absolute terms, but exhorbitant if compared to the local cost of living. The villa grounds were really well maintained, though the grounds itself were actually quite small, and there's nothing much to do beyond sunning oneself and going for spa treatments. The revamped spa rooms were beautiful though, and functional with attached open air baths. The main disappointment I have was with the beach- it's nonexistent. I tried swimming in the sea, but its quite rocky even in the shallow waters. Reduced to swimming in the resort's pool which was nice but still a shame."

","Great hotel stay at good value","We stayed at Qunci for 3 nights and overall, it has been a pleasant experience. The ocean view is phenomenal and the gardens are well-tended. Hotel is situated in a quiet corner of Sengigi, which is excellent if you want to get away from city life. The hotel staff was friendly and attentive to your needs. I stayed in a garden villa and the porch was a peaceful place to chill out in and surprisingly private despite its seemingly open concept. The only drawback is there is no TV set in your room which can be boring at night and u have nothing to do but sleep early. but again, I ended up feeling more rested after my vacation. The room can be further improved with brighter lighting as it is quite dim and more amenities would be appreciated (like slippers, liquid soap, hair dryer). But overall a great experience and I would highly recommend this villa to anyone going to Lombok!"

","Pure Bliss!","I cannot say enough about this hotel and its location. The rooms are neat, clean and comfortable with a huge outdoor bathroom (just keep to door closed to keep the mosquitoes out - the hotel fumigates the rooms every evening when turning the beds and provides plenty of electric mosquito repellents). Our room was listed as a âpartial ocean viewsâ but we could have a full view (villa no. 7) and it was located right in front of the bar with super easy access to the AMAZING infinity pools (three!). Despite our villa being located near the bar etc, we felt we had complete privacy. The breakfast was fresh and tasty. The food in Qunciâs restaurant was amazing. A well planned menu with very decent prices. We compared their prices with the quality of the food with some of the restaurants in Sengiggi and found that the Qunci restaurants were quite fairly priced as well as tasted delicious. My husband and I stayed there for 7 nights and did not want to leave. We arranged boat to the Gilli Islands. Just to get an idea, we hired a local boat, not a âfast (speed) boatâ, for the whole day and the skipper took us anywhere we wanted to go for a mere $60!! He took us snorkelling around all the beautiful spots and it was very safe. We loved it so much, we did it twice. Also, there are scooters/cars available for hire from the little huts outside the hotel at around $5 per day! This is a must do! We took the scooter and went further past the hotel (along the only main road) to some of the most amazing sites I have seen. AND be sure to keep your bathers on as you can stop at gorgeous beaches (where the locals hang) and take a swim. There is also a little shack at one of the bends where you can get coconuts. Take a picnic if you can and you can spend the whole day exploring the hidden beaches and local spots.The massage/spa at the resort is excellent but you want a way cheaper deal, check out some of the spas in Sengiggi. They are really good and cheap. Scuba diving can also be arranged from the great range of diving schools along the shopping strip of Sengiggi. There are also plenty of mini-marts from where you can get extra water, snacks etc. They pretty much sell everything. Some of the mini-marts also have services where they can drop you back to the hotel. Further, most of the good restaurants in Sengiggi also pick you up from the hotel and drop you off after your meal! Finally, we found the staff at Qunci to be most accommodating and friendly. They make you feel comfortable and ensure that you enjoy everything that this fabulous resort has to offer. My husband was addicted to the coconut water and arranged for one of the staff to bring him fresh coconuts from the local market along with many other local fruits (paying him of course!).Overall, I honestly cant wait to go back to Qunci!"

","weekend in Qunci","We went to Qunci Senggigi for a weekend to avoid the crowd in Bali. We looked for one of the best rated hotel in the area, and I have to say that Qunci desserves all excellent comments .First of all, a special mention for ALL the staff: very caring, smilling, professional.the location is great, especially at sunset for romantic couples: you would enjoy the sunset over the sea, with Bali in front of you.We had a room at 1st floor, overlooking the pool, with sea view, and we do not regret it. What a pleasure to take a tea/coffe on the balcony with such a view.The beach in front of the hotel is quite small and the sea could be rough, but on another hand the view is unspoiled, surfer beginners can practise just in front of the hotel, and for snorkelling/diving, the hotel can organize you a boat for only 2paxs, to the Gilli islands (1 hour to reach 1st island), and it's worth it!! It took me only 5 minutes to organize it with the reception.I particularly appreciated the care from the staff. Even if I checked out the day of my trip to Gili, they prepared towels for us and we could bring them on board of the boat, and when we came back, they offer us to take a shower in one empty room (I repeat, we already checked out at this time).This kind of attention contribute to make you enjoying your stay until the last minute.We tried the 2 restaurants, with a good choice of meals at reasonable prices, and some tasty ones.Breakfast is a la carte, with several sets, which would satisfy any particular taste/preference.We were delighted staying there, and will come back certainly when time permits. I would recommend it especially for couples/families."

","Great hotel, fantastic staff","We really enjoyed our stay at Qunci in March. It is a beautiful resort in a lovely location. We had an amazing room with an outstanding view of the ocean & were constantly told by staff when we had to give our room number we had the best room. Th e waves crashing on the beach as you slept was very relaxing.The breakfast was lovely, A set menu is offered with lots of variety, we never felt hungry afterwards. It is a welcome change from the usual picked over buffet. The staff were amazing, extremely attentive without being in your face. We found the ones we struck up a conversation with were geniunally interested in our holiday & our life in general.We ate at the resort several times, not in the restaurant as such but we had tapas by the pool which was fantastic. Very informal but the food was restaurant quality & first class.I have replied to a forum post before on this subject, but don't feel I would be giving an honest review if I didn't mention the building noise next door. We asked the question about this subject before we made our booking last year, & were assured it was very close to being finished at that time & wouldn't be an issue by the time we arrived for our holiday. It is still very much a construction site, in saying that we were, in the room next to the construction, & it is not a massive problem.It did go on til about 9pm each night, again only hammer , chisels & the occasional power tool. I know we could have asked to be moved but it certainly wasn't that much of an issue, I just think it should be mentioned in an honest review.The adults only pool is a great idea, there were lots of family's there which was great, but being able to have a little quiet time was very much appreciated.We would definetely return to Qunci, it is a great place to chill out & totally relax."

","Beautiful hotel and great staff!","Quinci villas is without a doubt a stunning hotel - it is magazine worthy it's that pretty and it's directly on the beach, the infinity pool looks out across the sand, at night every corner is lit up with candles and fires, there's first class cocktails, the most helpful staff and in general you just feel like you've hit the jackpot. The actual rooms however lack the incredible decor of the hotel grounds which is a bit disappointing. The room is a decent size but we had a thatched roof (the thought of spiders kept me awake at night - seriously) and a small bathroom. We also had a small balcony which we ate breakfast on one morning.There are 2 restaurants on site which are quite expensive and produce good food - not the best food but good food, both nights we ate there they were full of loud Australians...Theres a small bar which makes the most fabulous cocktails and they'll bring them to wherever you're sitting - they were quite slow in the evenings as I think they only had 1 person making them...they were worth the wait though especially when you're watching the sunset from a deck chair...The location of the hotel is pretty much in the middle of nowhere - you'd have to take a taxi into Lombok which we didn't do but you can wander along the beach, theres a little cafe next door which serves beer and large cococnut juices!The staff are really what makes the Quinci - nothing is too much trouble, they were efficient, polite, friendly and so helpful! They organised a private boat to take us the Gili Islands and carried our heavy luggage across the beach to where the boat was waiting :)Overall its a very nice accommodation but the rooms and the expensive food were slight disappointments. Also good to note - there are LOTS of people wandering up and down the beach in front of the hotel trying to sell stuff from scarves to jewellery to face painting etc and if they catch your eye they were stand and shout to you...VERY annoying but at the end of the day they're trying to make a living...but it's still annoying!"

","Would have given the resort a 5 if not for...","My husband and I stayed for 3 nights at this beautiful and idyllic resort. Our ocean view villa was perfect, with all the expected ammenities of a resort of this type. The outdoor shower was great and we enjoyed our balcony facing the swimming pools and the ocean. The pools are stunning, very clean and inviting. We spent a lot of time enjoying the outdoors, the pools, the ocean and the well manicured gardens. The included breakfast was plentiful and delicious. I had the eggs benedict twice. Our only negative review goes towards the evening meals. The appetizers and deserts ordered, were nicely presented and tasty, as well as my husband's Mediterranean chicken. The disappointment was my entree, the Greek style lamb chops with yogurt. The lamb was inedible and of very low quality. It was as if they had boiled or poached them. Of course, we returned them and they immediately offered to bring me something else. I ordered an Indonesian meat dish and the meat was very tough. They were very apologetic and offered to bring me something else. By this time, the evening was spoiled and I decided not to order anything further. The next morning we spoke directly with the chef and found out that he had had the night off. Later on the restaurant manager contacted us and said that the chef wanted to treat us to a real European style lamb rack. Again, a huge disappointment !!! Instead of the lamb rack, we were served the exact same lamb chops with yogurt. My husband, who is a very good eater, could not even cut them. Let me tell you that the manager agreed with us. Of course, they did not charge for the meal but our evening was, for the second time, ruined. We did have to pay for our drinks!! Needless to say, the following evening we dined at the Square Restaurant in Senggigi. Amazing food and service! Check out my review. Yes, the Qunci is a beautiful place to stay and the staff and management are very accommodating and pleasant. Just be very careful what you order at the restaurant. We were looking forward to staying put and enjoy the resort during our stay. Nonetheless, we were forced to leave the resort in order to have a nice dinner and the previous two nights, we did not enjoy our evenings. A pity since we just flew to Lombok to enjoy this resort."

","Paradise","We stayed here for 4 nights in April. Our expectations were not too high as we were told that Lombok was generally very rustic. When we arrived, we were amazed. The hotel property is pristine. It is the best kept property we have ever seen in a tropical climate - and we have been to quite a few in this area. The grounds were immaculate, the rooms are in amazing condition and the common spaces looked brand new. Such a condition is practically unheard of in a tropical climate. Needless to say, we were very impressed. Although the staff was constantly doing property upkeep (cutting the grass, gardening, cleaning, etc.) you did not even know they were there. They did not use any machines, everything is done by hand. I guess this is how they keep the property in such great condition without disturbing the guests. Although we read reviews about mosquitoes and bugs, we did not experience this at all during our visit. Mosquitoes were not a problem on the property - in fact, I usually leave our vacations covered in bug bites and I had none after this vacation. The property does a wonderful job of keeping things bug free (which is not an easy feat!). Our room was great - roomy, clean, comfortable and nicely decorated. Our bathroom had an open air shower which was lovely. We have stayed at other resorts with this feature and never really enjoyed it - but the one at Qunci is very well done and beautifully kept. I would suggest getting a room on the second floor, as they are more private than the rooms along the walkway on the first floor. The staff at the resort is very attentive and ever present without being suffocating. They speak English quite well and were able to accommodate our every request. They certainly made the experience wonderful.The beach is very nice; however, the sand is very rocky which makes swimming without ""aqua"" shoes difficult. This of course has nothing to do with the hotel, just an observation if you are one of those people (like me) or enjoys spending time in the ocean. The food at the resort is very good, but can be expensive. The breakfast included with our room was wonderful. A large selection of choices, all of which are delicious. The restaurants are also very good, but spending the entire day on the property eating and drinking can add up quickly. We ended up eating lunch at the property most days and drinking poolside - our food/drink bill was more than double our actual hotel bill! To help cushion this blow, the hotel does offer a happy hour from 5-7pm every night which is buy one, get one free. This deal is great; however, it does not include glasses of wine. It would be great if they would offer even a couple glasses of wine for happy hour.We did have some trouble with our airport transfer - i.e. it either was never booked or the car never showed up. As a result, our ride to the airport was 30 minutes later than expected. Although this caused some anxiety, we ended up getting to the airport in time for our flight without having to rush too much. The staff was very apologetic about the misunderstanding and worked quickly to fix the problem. Although we requested a late checkout - the hotel was unable to accommodate the request as someone was checking into our room later that day. Instead, the hotel did provide a room for us to shower/change in before our flight. This was very helpful and nice of them!Finally, we did use the spa facilities during our stay. The spa itself is lovely and the treatment rooms are beautiful and spacious. The staff at the spa is very helpful and nice and they speak wonderful English. Though the price was reasonable, the massages were just average. It seemed as though the therapists were simply going through the motions of a massage rather than being actual trained/experienced masseuses. After speaking with another guest, she mentioned she had the same experience, but asked for a more experienced masseuse for her second massage and had a much better massage the second time. We will definitely give the spa another chance and ask for a more experienced therapist next time. Overall, we had a wonderful stay at Qunci and we will definitely be back soon. I highly recommend this property and can't wait to return!"

","An Oasis of Paradise","A big applause to Qunci staff and management for creating an oasis of paradise for their guests. We only had 3 nights but it was a wonderful 3 nights!!We traveled with our 2 young daughters (4&8 yrs) and our family visiting us from Europe (also with 2 young children). We stayed in a variety of accommodations on this trip and quite honestly we were pleased to leave the best for last. We just wish we had more time!We have traveled extensively through Asia, Europe and the US and stay in a variety of accommodations depending on our priorities at the time. Qunci is, simply put, one of the best experiences we've had to date - and especially given the fantastic value for money. What really sets Qunci apart is the attention to detail through out the boutique hotel, a chic yet relaxed atmosphere, stylish and comfortable rooms (GORGEOUS outdoor bath), lovely pool setting overlooking the sea, fabulous cuisine, blissful spa and an amazing staff!Below I hope to provide some additional detail that added to the enjoyment of our stay.Family FriendlyIronically, we came close to not staying at Qunci because I was worried that it was more of a couples hotel. Reading some of the reviews it is apparent that couples and honeymooners seem to be catered to so I worried that we would not feel comfortable. Having said this, I decided that visiting during Easter would likely bring other families as it is school holiday week. I also sent an email to reservations and was assured that children are most definitely welcome but they made sure I was aware that there was no kids club, baby pool etc. It was a nice mix of people in the end and for those that choose to be away from children splashing, screaming and playing it is perfect that there is an adult only designated pool and lounge area. We were not made to feel unwelcome at all. The staff were lovely and playful and the children were delighted with the children's menu in the restaurant.Swimming PoolsThere are three pools to choose from (one being adult only). All pools are well positioned. The setting is lovely and it was so nice to be able to swim in the pool or sit in a lounge chair and look out onto the sea. And it was a welcomed treat to have one of the smiling staff bring a cold towel and a fruit skewer to us during our lazy afternoons.Families with young children who do not swim on their own should keep in mind that the pool does not have a shallow end for the kids to splash in. This was not a problem for us as ours are all swimmers but important for others to know.Many reviewers comment on the locals on the beach trying to sell their goods. You can see and hear them from the pools. This was also not an issue for us but I could tell that some guests seemed a bit bothered. A word of advice is if you do not want to interact with them simply do not make eye contact or respond to their questions. Once you do they consider it free game to continue the banter. We happily engaged when we were interested in something and were delighted with our purchases.Rooms and Construction Next DoorPrior to our trip I had read reviews and posts on the forum about the construction next door to Qunci. As such, I specifically requested two garden rooms on the opposite side of the hotel (away from construction). When we arrived in the early morning our rooms were not ready but Wiwit - the GM - arranged for us to have a temp room for the day as my nephew was quite sick with high fever and ear pain. She also arranged for a doctor to meet us at the hotel to check on him in the room. Ibu Indah came from the Sengiggi clinic and was amazing. She tended to my nephew with professionalism and lovely bedside manner. My nephew does not speak English but she was able to make him feel comforted with her motherly touch. We were grateful to the staff for arranging the drs visit and the temporary room for us to use while we waited for our room to become available. In the end we chose to stay in this room (thankfully it was vacant along with another next door) as it was next to the pool looking out to the sea. We thought this would be ideal given the fact that the little guy would be spending a lot of time in the room recovering and would give his parents easy access back and forth. The staff were happy to accommodate our request (even set up a tv for the patient!) and ironically we ended up in Rooms 22 and 24 Ocean Views which are the ones that I had initially requested not to be in because they are next to the new hotel being constructed.I can honestly say that the minimal noise from next door was not a problem. Yes we heard it but it was faint as it seemed to be more of finishing touches - no drilling or hacking. The evening noise could only be heard when in the bathroom because of the open air roof but this did go on until 9-930 on the nights we were there. Again we were not disturbed by it but if you are easily bothered by background noise then choose a room away from this end until construction is complete. My understanding is that this is automatically being done anyway.The rooms were lovely and created a zen like atmosphere to retreat to when in need of a break or at night. There was ample space for the four of us and the staff set up an extra bed and provided sheets for the day daybed/couch for our daughters to have their own space. The advantage of the ground unit is the amazing outdoor shower. It was divine and gives me inspiration for the bathroom I hope to have in my home some day. :) There is also a spacious outside area with another day bed, chair and table. Perfect if you choose to have breakfast in the room or for our happy hour when we were rained out by the pool.Cuisine and RestaurantsWe were impressed with the cuisine from breakfast through to dinner. Bkfst was beautifully presented and plentiful. We ate all of our lunches and dinners in the restaurants and were not disappointed. What we liked was the fact that you could choose to have something simple, local or more upscale. There was something for everyone. The set menu on the evening of the traditional performance was delicious - and the kitchen was always very accommodating to my vegetarian requests.We also enjoyed the two for one happy hour and yummy nibbles that were on offer at this time. The feta bruschetta was amazing!!!! The kids enjoyed the various smoothies and shakes that were on offer as well.Although the wine selection was not out of this world it presented some nice predictable options that were known to us. We had spent the previous 5 days on the Gilis drinking Bintang so it was a welcomed change for me as I am not a big beer drinker. The cocktails were nice change too!SpaWe did find time to sneak in a spa treatment and loved it. I had a wonderful facial with all natural products and thoroughly enjoyed the entire treatment. Once again the setting is lovely. Quite simple and so serene. From beginning to end I was made to feel special and was well looked after.StaffA common theme through out our stay was the genuine friendliness and attentiveness of the staff. Everyone we came in contact with made an effort to ensure our stay was perfect. It was apparent that the staff were happy and are proud to be a part of the Qunci family - this speaks volumes!!Lastly, a special shout out to Scott the owner who reads many of the reviews and forum posts. He is a hands-on owner who is always looking to make improvements and listen to his clientele. This makes a big difference and will help to keep Qunci the special gem that it is! If I had some recommendations for improvement I would offer them as I know they would be addressed but I am at a loss. We were hoping to meet Scott on our visit to give him our rave reviews first hand.We are fortunate to live in the region and will most definitely be back! We tend to not be repeat customers as we love to explore new places but I envision myself coming back to Qunci for a long weekend with my girlfriends, on another family get away and/or with some luck, just my husband one day! Thanks Qunci for a lovely holiday...til we meet again!"

","Wish we could have stayed longer","We had 5 fabulous nights at this gorgeous resort recently for our wedding anniversary over Easter. We were so impressed with everything ,including our room , a partial ocean veiw no 70 upstairs with a lovely breeze and its outdoor bathroom .We spent a lot of time lazing by the choice of 3 gorgeous pools watching local surfers in the ocean backdrop. The breakfast by the pool or room service were fantastic, fresh fruit platter and eggs in international choices ( we loved the Heuvos rancheros ) We also indulged a few times in some wonderful spa treatments, something we don't usually have time for at home. The staff were very professional and i loved all the natural products they used and especially the coconut bath after my volcanic mud wrap . The hotel organised a day trip to the Gilli islands with a local boat straight from the beach outside the resort and we went snorkelling at all 3 gilllis. The water was so clear and we saw 6 turtles.... it was a truly fabulous day . We had lunch one day at the little beach cafe Paradiso to the left of the resort. Delicious fresh fish and icy cold beers and so cheap . We also went into town for dinner a few nights in taxis ( that cost about $ 1 each way ) and our favourite was square. We wish we could have stayed longer but hope to go back again ...."

","Excellent hotel thanks to the staff!","We stayed 5 nights at the Qunci Villas and overall, our stay was very good. Grounds - beautiful and artistic. Beach side pools are amazing and the chairs around the pools are super comfortably. The beach is limited and the ocean is a bit rough but good for some boarding lessons!Room - very unique! There is ample space, beautiful balcony, comfortable bed and a fun outdoor bathroom and shower. Food and beverages- we are not beer drinkers and found the price of cocktail drinks a wee over priced. Food was a hit or miss we found. Breakfast was great! Always delicious and the staff offers to bring you breakfast to your room at the time you wish in the morning with no extra charge. It was nice to eat on your own private balcony. Lunch is tasty. A good selection to choose from. Dinner, however, we were not too keen about. We ate at the beach side restaurant, it was a nice atmosphere but were disappointed with the food. The vongole pasta was flavourless and the ""imported streak"" was very stringy and chewy. We ordered a bottle of wine with our meal and over all is wasn't very good. However, the chocolate mouse was very tasty. Service - Spa was great! Beautiful atmosphere and professional staff. We had the Balinese massage which was unforgettable and relaxing. The mani/pedi took too long...especially in the heat. It was suppose to be a 90min service but took just over 2 hours. The staff are so so lovely and friendly. They truly make the resort. They are so attentive and professional. They really made our stay at Qunci unforgettable!"

","Wonderful hotel with excellent service!","We just stayed 3 nights at this lovely beach hotel. We have booked an Ocean View room and got room no. 24. As there's a large construction site right next to those rooms, and the working hours are from 8am to approx. 9.30pm (!!!), I went to the front desk to ask for a quite room. The staff was extremely understanding, apologized and guaranteed a quite Ocean View room (no. 56) for the next day. After a lovely breakfast the next day, we dislocated to the huge and comfortable deck-chairs and soon one of the lovely staff members brought us the new room key. All our luggage was already moved. And the General Manager personally apologized and invited us for lunch. The rooms, the service, the pool area, happy hour, restaurants - everything was simply perfect and we should have stayed much longer!! But we will be back, for sure!!"

","AMAZING!!","This is our second visit to Qunci in a year, we love it, pure bliss. We stayed I the partial ocean view room, upstairs. The whole resort is like a piece of art and has been put together beautifully. Love the beautiful balconies, outdoor shower, super comfy beds, exceptionally clean rooms. The hotel is located just outside of Sengiggi, it took us about 30mins to walk into town, so it's the type of place that you go to if you just want to lounge, swim,eat& sleep. You can get Rp100k massages on the beach front (massage hut) or go to the spa, I can highly recommend the shiatsu massage at the spa. The 3 pools are beautifu and great for laps if you're keen. The ocean is spectacular and you can swim should you wish although occasionally it might be a bit too rough. The restaurants are international qaulity, and the breakfasts included in the room price are out if this world for an Infonesian establishment! The thing that makes this hotel perhaps my absolute favourite ate the staff, they are flawless and ever attentive. Love, love, love Qunci."

","You will leave with a smile","Wonderful setting, super nice staff, we had a really nice stay here on our first trip to Lombok. The views are great, sipping cocktails in the pool is a highlight, the rooms actually do look like the website. All in all, impossible to fault. It is a bit of a closed community though, so we rented scooters to explore and pottered in to the Sasak Cafe next door (turn right on the beach, first bar) where the local experience was great. Ask the guitar player to do his rendition of radiohead's Creep. It was great. All in all, Lombok is a gem."

","The best sunset pictures were taken here","For which dad made his first attempt in my 28 years of age, to kiss mom in front of me.Arriving from Bali, it was such a beautiful relief. The drive from the harbor to Senggigi was already breathtaking. Lovely hotel. Beautiful landscaping. Great service. A bit on the touristy side (for Lombok standard) only because it's quite huge. Better for the younger crowd cause there was definitely more of a scene going on here than its close neighbors. Inside the room felt slightly spare... perhaps because the bed was so centered and close the the entrance. I think either adding more traditional elements or going more minimal while varying up the lighting would cozy up the interior. AMAZING, UNFORGETTABLE SNAKE FRUIT CHILLI MARTINI."

","Close to perfect","This place obviously doesn't need any more rave reviews but its true it is amazing. Without exception the staff were wonderful from the man who cleaned the room and made a dog out of towels for our daughter to the gardener who climbed up the palm trees to lop the palms. The spa treatments were stunning. We stayed in a pool villa which was super luxurious and a decent sized pool. I liked the fact you could eat in your villa for no extra cost and nothing seemed too much for the staff. Everything seemed to be super easy for them and its impossible to feel any kind of stress there. Can't recommend the place highly enough."

","Nice Place","We stayed over spring break. Our expectations were not high, regardless of the reviews on this site, as we are long-time Asian travelers, and have seen many beach resorts that don't really deliver in many ways. However, this is one of the best places we have stayed (and we've stayed in many).The place was almost full, but not crowded. Staff is quite good, and well-trained, with excellent English skills. Very good ambiance, and overall well-done. Food good, and not overpriced like some beach resorts. So not much to add to the favorable reviews here.Only a couple of things. The beach is not great (not wide; slants fairly steeply, and the bottom is coral). So if you want beach may not be the best for you. What would make it better - and more of an upscale place even - would be a better wine list. This often is a challenge in Asia, and what they offer is mostly 'plonk'. They can set themselves up much better and differentiate here, if they wish."

","Sensational Stay- review very late!","My boyfriend and I stayed at Qunci Villas in January and organised it at the very last minute- the night before! The staff accommodated us in a wonderful garden view room which was spacious for the two of us and had everything we needed.The first thing we did when we got the resort was eat and after having food posining for the previous 5 days in Bali, i didnt think i would be able to consume anything.....but i couldnt stop eating!! It was the freshest, best quality food we at our whole trip (3 weeks) in indonesia.We loved Qunci so much that we extended our stay by another night and went to the Gilis a day late. We really took advantage of the relaxing atmosphere and stayed by the pool everyday, ate over looking the water each night and relaxed.We will be back to Qunci- hopefully for our wedding!! We had a meeting with Wiwt while we were there and are very impressed!!! Once we know when we want to get married we will be incontact with Wiwit and get it organised!!!We absolutely loved it and cant wait to be back there sipping cocktails by the pool :) thanks Qunci!"

","Great Place for Total Relaxing","Stayed there 28feb-5 March,Qunci Villas is lovely Resort and only about 5 minutes by Taxi to Senggigi beach area(cost AUD2$). i was""""woooow"" once i arrived in this resort, the property absolutely beautiful n well maintained, The rooms are huge( this time i booked garden view) i enjoy the outdoor shower,The cleanliness, service and overall attention to detail are what you would expect from a very classy expensive hotel, the staff are excellent( they keen to be there for u ) , food out of this world( my fav was RENDANG ROLL and LUMPUR LAPINDO MUD CAKE )unbelievably good.The Idea of my travelling to this resort was just total relaxing after long 5 weeks holiday to Thailand, Java and Bali and Qunci Provided everything for me But the best part by far was the absolute indulgence to hang around at the poolside area to just reading, relaxing, eating , Drinking and sleeping n Qunci is good for it.Before you get too excited, be sure you're coming as a couple[ I travel Solo :( ] no matter if straight, gay, married or partnered, for Qunci is a place for romantics. Beside u can enjoy yourself, it was plenty social as well,The 5 days( i wish i have more time ) I stayed provided an interaction with other guests from around the world on some afternoons and evenings by the pool and wonderful bar outside, while other nights would offer quiet, uncrowded use of the resort.1st Time to Lombok and Qunci and i absolutely Fall in love with this island, the peoples and this property and absolutely will on my list every time i go to Indonesia.Special thanks to Mr Nova who gave me nice warm welcome and quickly addressed my concern at 1st night stay and make it perfect for the rest of my stayed..thank u for staffs Ahmad, Jayadi and few other staffs that i could remember the name , u guys Rock and keep it up your great job.Suggestion to the management::: Because most of the guests will be in the pool area during their stay, would be good idea if the hotel provide them complimentary small bottles of cold water to each guest when they come to the pool ( this what Conrad Bali did ), this little thing will could adding special touch and it wont cost much n the guest b happy."

","Great staff makes the difference","Before discussing the rooms and amenities of this hotel, it is essential to talk of the staff. The warmth, sincerity, helpfulness, and overall enjoyment in dealing with the staff of Qunci Villas are simply second to none. First, there seem to be staff everywhere, whenever you need them. Look around and there is someone ready to assist. The English spoken by the staff is generally high level so communicating with the staff, whether at the restaurant or the pool was never a problem. But most important, all staff exhibited a warmth and friendliness that was both disarming and welcome. I donât mean the standard smile one sees at most tourist spots; this was a from-your-heart warmth that was real and seen too infrequently when one travels.The hotel itself is lovely. The grounds and the rooms are beautiful and immaculate. The rooms were a good size with a reasonable amount of storage. The bathrooms, too, were sizeable with nice facilities. The beach in front and adjacent to the hotel is a bit disappointing due to its rocky, rather than sandy, bottom. However, the design of the pool makes one feel that you are actually sitting on the beach so that somewhat mitigates the problem. The free breakfast is quite nice, although my wife and I would have preferred more Indonesian choices rather than simply the fried rice and fired noodles found everywhere. The restaurants were quite nice with good food and fairly reasonably prices, but once again, the menus were very limited in their choices of Indonesian items. This seems to be a problem in many Indonesian tourist areas. One evening the hotel sponsored an Indonesian night at one of its restaurants. While welcome, it did not make up for the lack of Indonesian choices on other evenings. While we went in to Senggigi, the local town for lunch on several occasions, it is not much of a town, so we spent most of our evenings at the hotel.Internet connectivity was very frustrating. Not only was it slow, it was erratic. Sometimes you couldnât even get the signal to sign-on, while other times my wife could find the signal on her tablet while I couldnât. Other times, we would mysteriously lose the signal in the middle of a transmission, only to gain it back shortly. All in all, the internet was an unsatisfying experience in an otherwise very enjoyable and pleasant stay."

","Just wrong","To me Qunci Villas represents everything that's wrong about how we care for nature -- here's this nice beach and they've built the resort as close to the water as possible and they put some wading pools on the edge so you can look out on the ocean without ever getting on the sand.What's wrong with that? It's a beach! It's an ocean! Yeah this beach is not so nice to sunbathe on, but that's why you go to one of the nicer beaches for that.And then there are the rooms. LP calls this resort the hippest in Lombok, with so-called minimalist decor. There's a difference between minimalist and cheap, and this place is certainly not the former.At the bottom of this stinking heap is the personnel. To call them incompetent wouldn't be fair. During our two-night stay everything screamed mis-management. There was the tourist trap of a dinner and dance performance. There were some pretty bad meals at both Quah (the mediterranean) and Quali (the Asian). There was the rude responses at simple questions.I'm convinced the managers at Qunci Villas have no interest in training their staff or managing this place properly. It's all wrong at this NON-idyllic place."

","Perfection -look nowhere else for your holiday in Lombok, just stay here!","Wow is what I have to start with. We were only here for 2 nights unfortunately but I wish it had been 2 weeks. This hotel is like most other 5 star hotels in terms of its amazing rooms, service and location, but what sets it apart is all the little touches which make it extra special. Starting with a fresh ice cold towel on arrival as you step out of the hot taxi, and then a refreshing coconut drink while you check in. There is a fresh fruit platter waiting for you at your room, and they bring you one every day. The hotel is about showcasing art all around, and your room contains beautiful original art everywhere (none of those awful watercolor typical hotel paintings). This may sound weird, but the lighting in your room is incredible, soft and moody with down lights illuminating the statutes and art pieces in your room. There are 3 pools so plenty of space for everyone to spread out and not feel on top of each other, an adults only pool for those wanting some peace and quiet, and huge double day beds. Other little touches include fresh fruit skewers served around the pool in the afternoon, and you're also brought cold face cloths to cool off with when you're lying by the pool in the afternoon. The food is great, but what really makes this place is just how friendly all the staff are and how willing they are to make your stay as wonderful as possible. This place was paradise and we abandoned initial plans to explore Lombok and just enjoyed relaxing at Quinci villas. My only reservation when booking here were the mentions of the annoying hawkers some reviews mentioned. There were lots of hawkers walking up and down the beach trying to sell sarongs etc, my advice would be if you don't want to be bothered at all, don't lie on the loungers closest to the beach."

","Classy but too crowded and packed. Lack special touch","We stayed at Jeeva Klui before staying at Qunci for 1 night only. I don't want to make direct comparison, instead focus on Qunci here but would like to say I prefer Jeeva Klui, but this is a personal choice :).The decor from the front desk to room and spa, the entire hotel oozes class and the design and decor are the modern and up-to-date design. I'm not denying it. It's really a nice classy hotel. I love my 1 bedroom pool villa's minimalist design and the shower offers privacy despite being an outdoor shower. .The hotel ground is extremely crowded, every single available plot on the hotel grounds are fully utilised - our room actually is just about 100m from the front desk and on the same row! There's a school right opposite on the road and you can hear noises of children playing and the bell ringing. To top that up,we can hear really really really loud noise from the generator at the shower, it practically spoil the mood as It is even audible in the room. We asked the hotel staff and were told there was no power supply, hence the generator. It wasn't the ideal quiet private getaway after all!!Rooms around the hotel are build so close together. Even the restaurant and pools are within close proximity to each other and with the rooms. There are also many people walking around in the hotel grounds. Good luck in finding an empty sunbed, well except when its getting dark. I guess this only shows how popular and booming their business is.At night, there are numerous tables set up at the available area by the pool, which is also by the beach,again, clever use of available grounds, for a memorable candlelight dinner.We got up early in the morning for a swim in the private pool, but the hotel have not turn on the water pump. I called the front desk for almost an hour but nobody picked up. I can even hear the phone ringing at the front desk from the room. That's how close the buildings are in the hotel. I gave up and went out the door and asked twice, if it is possible to turn on the pump. Both staffs promised to turn it on but as expected, did not happen.Breakfast served was cold probably because they have to deliver to so many, but edible although not tasty and limited selection. It's a big organisation, professional looking, staff are courteous but lack that special touch that makes me feel welcomed. We stayed for only 1 night but did not regret our decision."

","A gem, in a limited space beach side","I love these villas. My friend and I went in December. We arrived super late (as always with the local airlines) - and it was almost the last flight, and we were greeted and picked up by the nice hotel staff. I noticed that there was another guest (which was on the same flight) heading to the same villa, but surprisingly - we were not put in the same car. They sent two cars instead :-) *and we got a nicer car....*Drive from the airport to hotel was super long - but have no worries, if you're into getaway and relaxing , you don't have to (or i suspect you don't want to) get out of the villas. It has everything i wanted / needed.We went obviously not on the right season, because it was rainy all day - but never the staff complained for delivering food to our villas (we were lethargic, and it was raining all... day, so even going to the restaurant it took us extra effort and stamina).We arrived in the hotel at 2am in the morning. Surprisingly they upgraded our room and gave us a very nice villa facing the sea â literally in front of the pool facing the sea. We got the villas facing right to the sea (well these part of the island is really not for swimming in the sea...), and was the quiet side of the villas (because the other side was the crowded - busy side where all the open bars and adult pool exist). Do ask for this side if you need a quiet holiday.Foods are extremely good. I am addicted to their eggs benedict - and their welcome drink (it was coconut water with keffir leaves). The drink was served when we arrived, and when i requested for it again (because it wasn't in the menu), they served it for me !Have no worries for the room order - they will deliver it on time, and not compromising the service. Even breakfast - they were very on time for delivery. Even during the rain â they did not complain or say it will be late. Not at all.Oh - don't forget that they have happy hour for the cocktails.. and they have great cocktails (but took a little while for serving)They even have option if you want to have candle light dinner :-)Spa is great - i would suggest trying their Spa. I took their 90 mins spa - but book in advance, it was difficult to book. I love all the essential oils - they were so natural. The staff were very trained as well. It was expensive, but worth it. I love the rooms - i think i could stay in the room all day. But please note : that these room is very suitable for honey mooners - no Tv (so please notify them if you need TV for the kids), huge bathroom (but no bath tub, instead, they have very nice open showers).Overall - this is a great place if you need a quick getaway. But do bear in mind - access to nearest market and etc is difficult, so do stop by in a market prior to arrival.ask the driver - if you need to buy ""songket"" or traditional lomboknese cloth - he could show you a very good bargain cooperative stores.Drawbacks : the sellers are really nagging and annoying, they stand by your pools all dayyy !... try getting your Bahasa / someone who speaks bahasa to help you bargaining or just shooing them away.Also - Sengigi has a limited beach side, so do not expect too much on playing in the sands."

","I wanted to stay longer","Loved this hotel the sun lounges and closeness to the beach was ideal. Warm and friendly staff. We had an upstairs villa and although the view of the ocean was great next time I will have ground floor as I like a dark room and my friends had ground floor and could not hear the call to prayer from the mosque which started at 4:40 in the morning.

","This place is more than a gem!","What a wonderful hotel in a fabulous setting!The setting is wonderful.The architecture is great.The rooms very spacious.Service is top notch.Very well maintained.The staff are well trained and eager to please.The food is very good.THREE horizon pools right next to the sea.Eat all your meals on the deck right by the seaside if you want to... and why not?Sooo romantic!!... could go on and on!!You can have a massage by the seaside or in the spa.If you want to have a snorkelling day out to the Gilli Islands, you can barter with the guys on the beach. A good day out but if you have been to the Maldives... the snorkelling does not match up.We had fantastic sunsets while there!Do not book your taxi transfer with the hotel unless you have special requirements. When you arrive at the airport, there are a couple of taxi booths just before you leave the arrivals terminal. prepay your taxi (Rpa 170,000 - about $17.00) and this is all you need to do. The taxi ride is just over 1 hour.Before you leave, ask reception to book you a Bluebird Taxi as they are cheaper than the hotel transfer and very good. The taxis are metered and the trip back to the airport should cost in the region of Rpa 150,000 plus airport parking. To time your airport arrival for departure, allow 1 hour 30 mins just incase there is heavy traffic. We arrived for our flight about 1 hour beforehand to find that it actually left 20 mins EARLY!"

","Excellent property not so excellent staff","Stayed here for 3 days 2 nights in march 2013, moving from Ubud, Bali. Qunci is excellent property overall: clean, nice ambience, nice location close to the best restaurants in senggigi, great pools and bars, beachfront, strong running water in the shower, reasonably priced rooms. Don't miss the happy hour cocktail Qunci sure knows to make good cocktailI have no idea with the excellent service review from other guests, from what I notice they tre certaina rac better than the others. I experienced some drawbacks with the staff, I wished they are more well trained and coordinated. These incidents happened during my stay: Cocktail took unreasonably long time to make, had to ask for a scissors 3 times in 20 minutes because the staff have forgotten or just listened and not done anything, the springbed I was sleeping on was bent (result of overuse) and being back sensitive I was almost sleepless for 2 nights. I asked for late check out (3pm) as we had an evening flight out, they turned us down with the reason our room was already booked by next guests, finally after some negotiations they let us move into a temporary room to use from 12-3. When I demanded to move at 11, front desk (different person this time) forgot what they promised, but they still moved us anyway. Back from lunch and gift shopping to see our luggage in the other room but the room was not made up from the old guests!! Our old room (next door) was also not made up I don't understand why they had to move us to a used room when our room was left untouched and they refused late check outOverall had an ok stay but I feel that Qunci has to keep up in terms of service as far as I know there are quite many properties being built around senggigi and competition will be fierce in the future. The only reason I can see coming worth coming back to this property is the room price"

","Sublime & relaxing sojourn .......","Qunci Villas, Mangsit, Lombok.For those arriving by SILKAIR, the evening/night drive to the resort can take up to 2hrs, depending in traffic. Ours was about 75mins on minimally lit roads.We stopped by a grocery shop for 2 cartons of bottled water and some munchies. Weâre unaware that along the Qunci Villas road thereâre a few family run tuck-shops that sell bottled water too! Dang!Thereâre 03 entrances to the resort with North, Middle and South Entrances depending on where your assigned villa is. The resort was laid out in a North-South orientation, parallel to the black-sand beach. As other reviewers have pointed out, thereâre 3 swimming pools. The South pool and Middle pool were almost identical in size. The North pool was rather smallish and about a third the size of the other 2. Do be mindful when using the pools as some of the bottom floor tiles have come loose and may cut into your feet.A reviewer mentioned that villa 23 (with uncovered outdoor shower/bath area) was the one featured in the website. Itâs as accurate as you can get. Weâre initially assigned this very room on the upper floor and we only lasted a night here due to the noisy construction just 2 metres away next door, to the South. We asked for a change in villa and management was very helpful by giving a tour of the grounds the next morning and explaining which were available. The one I finally chose was one of the best and original units when Qunci Villas was just launched. I shall not divulge the villa number as all the Ocean-facing villas are equally as good. This particular villaâs layout was very well thought out. The materials used for construction were noted very different from the other villas. Pillars were a darker shade of walnut and round in shape. Weâre on the upper floor (with covered shower) and thereâre hardly any loud aural disturbances. We didnât even hear the mosqueâs call to prayer in our 7 days there! Most of our days were spent lazing on the balconyâs outdoor sofa that was aligned perpendicular to the beach. The sights and sounds from this particular balcony were just therapeutic, calming and AWESOME! Thunderstorms, blue-sky days and gorgeous sunsets were witnessed from this very same lounging pose (without moving a muscle, â¦ ok, maybe moved an eyeball or two!). Weâre so close to the evening cocktails bar that the very nice lady would bring our drinks and nibbles to our balcony. When I come back, Iâll most definitely ask for this villa again â¦â¦. Qunci Villas management â hint, hint!Brekkies can also be consumed at your balcony or at any of the 3 restaurants. We preferred an early swim then go for late brekkie at one of the restaurants, avoiding the âisland rush hourâ. I heard that management only allows one serving of brekkie per couple per villa from a very reliable source but I could not verify this as almost every morning, weâd ask for 2nd servings after we finished our 1st, and the wait staff happily obliged! Could the management clarify on this please?As for those who are foodies, be sure to ask for âSambal Lombokâ or âSambal Olekâ which will bring a nice touch of spicyness to the food!We had all of our lunches & dinners across the road, opposite the resort. âWarung Sasakâ was our dinner venue every night with BBQ-ed fresh fish, salads and gado-gado. From the 2nd visit onwards weâre given complimentary desserts of home-made kuih dadar guling which were FANTASTIC!We didnât have lunch everyday due to late brekkie. When we did, we had the local rice fare with veggies, curry and sambal from a âgeraiâ just north and next to the school. The old lady and man who ran the place were so interesting, we stayed after lunch for a cuppa and a chat.For those who like walks, do try along the beach on a Northerly direction till you reach a mini-cape. Thatâs the end of the Mangsit beach. Another walk is on the main road running parallel to the coast, northwards. We walked all the way to the end of Klui beach, passing another resort âJeeva Kluiâ. This resort is even more out-of-the-way with practically nil warungs, grocery shops, etc.Our daily ritual â morning swim, brekkie, relax, snorkel further out, relax, dinner â¦â¦.. repeat the next day and the next â¦.! Reading material is essential. Wi-Fi worked everywhere and everyday on the resort. We didnât do laundry as weâre in our beachwear all the time. But if needed, âWarung Sasakâ also doubles up as laundry service provider.For the sake of readers, listed here were some minor inconveniences which we didnât particularly experience but mentioned by other guests we chatted with â the mosqueâs call to prayer in the wee hours of the morning, weekly fogging of grounds, touting on the beach, almost daily power black-outs on the resort anytime of day, noisy children, mozzies/insects in the bedroom, etc. The staff was the biggest asset of the resort. It does help if you can babble in a bit of Indo language. With my barely passable Bahasa, I tried conversing daily with almost all the staff we met. A lot of requests were completely hassle-free and friendlier once weâve established the common lingua-franca! Hahahahaha â¦â¦â¦..My standards and expectations of a boutique beach resort went up a few notches with Qunci Villas living-up its true objective in providing a sublime environment, unique experience and totally relaxing atmosphere!Iâd come back in a heartbeatâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.N.B. Thereâre future developments flanking the North (Verve Hotel/Villas??) and South of Qunci Villas which may mar the beauty, exclusivity and uniqueness of Mangsit Beach when the hordes of package tours arrive!"

","Amazing place to stay!!!","This is a really beautiful hotel with amazing service from the staff. The 3 swimming pools are amazing and they have an adults pool if you want to keep out of the way of children. The room was great, very spacious and clean. The only downside was they come in and spray the room every evening to prevent bugs and 1 evening I had quite a few dead bugs on my floor when I came back from dinner. My last night I also had a very large cockroach on my bedroom floor which I managed to catch. The outside bathroom was very clean and had a lot of amenities. The veranda was also a great place to hang out when it was raining and read my book.The food here was brilliant, the breakfast was amazing and every restaurant serves a slightly different breakfast- you must try the banana pancake!! The only downside was I wasn't allowed to choose anything off the lunch menu for dinner- I personally preferred the lunch menu. The poolside snacks were also amazing.The hotel is a good 45min walk into sengigi but it is only a 15,000IDR taxi journey so I would definitely get a taxi into town. When my shuttle bus didn't arrive to pick me up the hotel staff were great at ringing the tour operator to find out what had happened and made sure someone came to pick me up.I would definitely stay here again if I go back to Lombok and would recommend friends to stay here as well."

","Excellent property","We stayed several nights here in March 2012 in combination with a stay at Lombok Lodge and would definitely choose Qunci again, even with money no object. Qunci was streets ahead in so many ways. We fled to Lombok after many years holidaying in Bali because Bali feels much too crowded now. Lombok is a lovely change of pace (though a far less sophisticated holiday experience than Bali). We spent a lot of time on property, as Sengiggi pretty much a dusty old one-horse town. The food at Qunci is great - waterfront breakfasts with delicious fresh juices were a treat, and lunch and dinner were always more than satisfactory. The beach hawkers were no bother at all - very friendly, never harassing, and just trying to make a living like the rest of us. Boatmen also patrol the beach, so easy to arrange a day trip with them directly. We were over to the Gilis 3 times during our holiday - some boatmen are better than others, we had 2 great ones and 1 very sullen guy with no English. Surfing lessons are also available from the stall next door - fun to watch them during breakfast! We were there during peak construction of the new section of the resort, and while staff and management did all they could to avoid disruption to guests from this, they were mostly powerless to do anything to stop the noise and dust from another company's construction site on the other side of the hotel (hence the 3 rating on sleep quality below). These ""blips"" are inevitable, but a property really shows its colours in how it addresses them. The hotel manager dealt with our concerns promptly and professionally, and we were extremely happy with the resolution. This other construction kept us away from the pool in our villa, however we were quite happy to spend our time by the resort pool instead - quieter, much sunnier and with drinks service! We would definitely stay again, but would bypass the pool villa for one of the beachfront rooms.Pros:Lovely, well-appointed roomsFriendly staffExcellent foodGreat location - outside of Sengiggi but you're not missing much and lots to do at Quinci (great pool, spa, surfing lessons, excursions to the Gilis)Cons:Less sophisticated than a comparable property in Bali, but that's Lombok and fine with us Housekeeping needs some work - something large relieved itself on my pillow 2 evenings in a row while we were out at dinner, and it took 3 tries to get the bedlinens changed (so 3 rating on Cleanliness but otherwise things were very well-maintained)Construction noise (should have ended by now?)Narrow beach (but fine for swimming)No snorkelling to speak of"

","Delightful Stay!","We stayed at Qunci Villas for 4 nights with our 10 month boy. Right form the moment we stepped in, we knew that the service was top class. We were given a ground floor room, so that we don't have to carry the stroller up. And a travel cot was promptly fitted into the room. The room itself (can feel slightly dated) is wonderfully done up. Nice art, comfortable bed and a nice open-air bathroom. We noticed that all the staff were extremely courteous and would make small talk with us, while making big talk about our boy! By the second day, I think half of the people were calling by boy by his name! Talking to him, waving at him and blowing him kisses. When we were at breakfast, a lovely waitress called Riya even carried him, so that we could eat our breakfast! Really awesome!The strip of beach is narrow, but the pool is great. The food at the restaurants is great, but room service was not right up there (primarily because of Chinese New Year). But, overall, it's the people who make this place. I will return again and again and again!"

","Great holiday in little heaven","We were in this hotel at the end of February and I can say, that it was unforgetable vacation.Everything was perfect: great and tasty breakfast with fruits, unbelievable dinner... My husband loved Goreng meals and other asian dishes. Sauces were above the expectation.Very friendly and smiley staff... We are very glad, that our choice has stopped on this little piece of heaven.One thing - on the beach there is a lot of local gift ""sellers"", but if you spend about 15 min and USD 1.5 for the taxi - in Senggigi you can buy the same masks, pottery, etc. in two or three times cheaper :)"

","Excellent Property.","Last week was out third stay at this hotel. We have seen it swell from a small boutique hotel 10 years ago to the larger resort it is today without skipping a beat in the level of service and quality of accommodation.

","A stylish Lombok experience","We stayed at the Qunci over the Chinese New Year holiday week in early Feb 13, we expected it to be a busy period, so booked way ahead, several months actually. After a couple of late revisions to our schedule, we had the opportunity to experience 2 different villas - which wasn't actually a bad thing. Our first Villa for 2 nights was an upstairs with partial seaview. It had a lovely veranda and a comfortable couch for chilling out. A lot of the reviews of Qunci commented on the cleanliness of the villas and we were not disappointed in that regard. The rooms are very clean and the furniture to a good standard. The bathrooms were fairly large and modern and had an outdoor shower (which is always nice) with a nice powerful pressure, which after a day in the sun and sea, is very welcoming.The Villas are supplied with plenty of bottled water and give you a fridge also to keep it chilled. We liked the partial seaview villa and is definitely worth considering if you don't want to pay the price for the pool villa (which we had for the remainder of our trip). There is also no difference in size or furniture, so you are not really losing much by not having your own pool. Besides, the resort itself has three beautiful infinity pools for everyone to use, so there is really no loss in comfort with the partial view.The resort fronts onto a gorgeous black sand beach, which has the most fantastic seaview. As you would expect, the water is beautiful and deep blue, albeit the strength of the waves and current are right for surfing, but not swimming too far out. Another downside of the beach is the local 'salespeople' who can be somewhat annoying and will pester you with their wares. This is not the fault of the resort as it is a public beach, but it is something you have to get used to.The dining facilities are great, lots of space and you can choose to eat inside one of the two dinning rooms, or outside by the pool facing the sea - these premium tables go quickly, so hurry. The menu for breakfast doesn't change and the portions are quite large. One tip is the freshly squeezed fruit juice, it really is perfection, don't hesitate to ask for 2nds and 3rds (and even 4ths) I did every morning!! Dinner on the other hand and drinks are a little less satisfying. The quality of the drinks and food is still the same very good, but are astronomically overpriced. For the price of a couple of cocktails in the evening after happy hour, We had a fully days sailing and snorkeling to the Gilis. After the first night, we opted to eat outside of the resort, where the prices were much more amenable (i.e realistic) even with the taxi fares. The nearest town is Sengiggi which is a short 5-10mins taxi ride away, this had plenty of eateries with lots of choice in selection. After 2 nights we moved into our pool villa. One word, Superb. The pool was quite large enough to swim laps, and also had some depth to it I think 5ft 6in. With the pool also comes a terrace and sun loungers. In short you do not need to leave your villa for anything!! However, we decided we want to dive the Gillis and visit the waterfalls in the north of the island. I totally recommend both, each are a whole days experience, but once again, if you book through the hotel, they will positively rob you blind. For the resort to organise your trip to the Gillis, This is round trip pick up in a private vehicle to the jetty and a private boat with captain and mate for the day - they quoted us more than INR1m. In Sengiggi town, one of the many activity providers located there charged us INR300k for the same trip. It was the same for the trip to the waterfalls of Sendang Gile. The hotel quoted us INR700K each for a private vehicle and driver. We called one of the companies in the town and got the same trip for INR300K for both of us!! One thing to be wary of is hidden charges in these trips. INR100 for the Police registration at the jetty (they call it rescue insurance, which is very reassuring) but at the waterfall, the local guides charge INR400K each person to show you the 2 waterfalls. After a little bit of stern negotiation, we paid INR100K for both of us! Sendang Gile is an absolute must visit. the first waterfall is awesome, but the second is breathtaking. Word of warning, you need to be quite fit for the climbing and trekking, this is not a disabled friendly activity and the hills are very steep.Other than the resorts 'competitive pricing' this is an absolutely fabulous resort to stay at. One thing I can also compliment the resort on was the very late check out they offered. We were allowed to stay in our pool villa until after 3pm when the normal vacating time is midday. The resort will do their best to find you an alternative room if yours is needed, so you can check out at the time of your choosing. In short, an awesome place to stay."

","Would not hesitate to return","We spent 4 nights at Qunci over CNY in a garden view room. The resort and grounds are beautiful and tastefully decorated. The room however was basic/little tired but comfortable. The happy hour cocktails were one of the highlights - all made with fresh fruits/juices and unbeatable way to watch the famous Lombok sunset. Good choice of food at the restaurant for all meals so there is no real need to wander into town if you didn't want to.The staff were attentive, polite and accommodating. Late 3pm check out was not an issue as we had a evening flight home.The afternoon fruit platter delivered to your room and nightly turn down service + extra spritz of mosquito spray was a nice touch. Spa treatments were good but on the slightly expensive end. You can catch one of the long boats right by the beach directly in front of the resorts if moving onto the Gilis. Bookings made through reception."

","I enjoyed my stay very much","I just loved my room with a huge balcony with a comfortable couch looking over the internal garden and the beach. They had perfect sea breeze and you could hear a tiny bit of nice relaxing music sound from your balcony. Having breakfast in the balcony was the best part of my stay at Qunci!I would say that the hotel's infinity pool is one of attractive points to be at Qunci.Spa treatments were also good: I can recommend hair treatment - after exposed strong sun and sea water, my hair needed some treatments and the spa's hair treatment really helped my hair to be healthy.I also liked their Lombok massage, especially the massage oil was superb: nice fragrance and good texture. I had to ask the Spa if they can sell some of the massage oil... unfortunately, the same one was not available when I asked due to a new production process (or something). However, a spa staff kindly prepared a small bottle for me! (it's billed, but it was worth it.)It was a peaceful stay for me."

","Lovely resort, just a few niggles...","Stayed at this hotel for 7 nights in a pool villa - which was an absolute dream !! The grounds of the hotel are wonderful, staff are friendly. Must recommend going to the bar down by the adult pool for happy hour 1700-1900 to watch the stunning sunset. Breakfast choice is al-a-carte with enough choice and you can chose to have it in your room at no extra charge. Plenty of free water provided in your room also. Onto the niggles....when breakfast is served in your room sometimes you get everything you ordered and sometimes you don't and have to wait for them to return with all of it. The plug location in the pool villas isn't great - they are as far away from the mirrors as is possible. Some times staff come round to rooms with a fruit platter - sometimes they didn't, same with the night time turn down service, no major issue just seemed a bit inconsistent....Also had to ask a few times to have our tea/coffee supply in the room to be topped up.Taxi ride into Sengiggi takes a good 10mins but is around Â£1 ! Must also make note that you can't change any currency on a Sunday."

","Beautiful, atmospheric and calm!","I stayed in Qunci Villas for five nights in February. It was a fantastic experience and I cannot recommend the hotel more. The grounds are stunning and the whole place is full of beautiful artwork and greenery. Service is exceptional and the management are very accommodating to one's requests; I was allowed to upgrade my room from a garden to an ocean view after the first night and was given a late check out on my last day due to my evening flight. There is a great attention to detail in the presentation and approach that makes one feel like a treasured guest - fresh flowers tucked into the bed linen every morning, personalised letters informing one's of special menus/festivities and candle-lit tables set out on the sand at night.Location-wise, Qunci Villas is situated along Mangsit beach and is just 5 min way from the main Senggigi area by taxi. The hotel is fronted by a quiet, black-sand beach with few tourist touts and the three lap pools facing the sea make for an atmospheric setting. The two restaurants are slightly pricey but serve a good range of Western/Indonesian food and the bar has a happy hour with 1-for-1 drinks from 5-7pm which is a great way to unwind while enjoying the sunset. Was also very impressed with the in-house Qamboja spa which has a great range of treatments and very professional therapists - try the Qunci wrap! The rooms are spacious, well-designed and have large balconies and bathrooms. I would however have liked to have coffee/tea making facilities and some maps/information about Lombok and the various tours offered by the hotel. The reception can easily provide the latter but it would have been nice to browse through. It's also worth noting that the rooms do not come equipped with a TV so you need to ask reception to set one up for you.Overall, Qunci ticked off very box on my list for a pleasant, relaxing and indulgent beach getaway in Lombok at an attractive price. I will definitely be returning."

","Amazing weekend","We booked Qunci to spend the weekend mountain biking in Lombok with Infinity Mountain biking. We booked this beautiful resort on the beach and couldn't have had a better place to stay. In between all the action in the surrounding mountains we had the most amazing time to unwind in Qunci. The resort is very elegant and well laid out. The staff are extremely friendly. The breakfast was very good and their massages heaven.We arrived Friday night late. The restaurant was already closed at this late hour so they send staff through the rain to get us delicious local Nasi Goreng to easy our hungry stomachs :-)In between our rides we enjoyed the comfortable beds of our bedroom. We slept like roses. We will be back for sure. Thank you again!"

","Awesome wedding hosters","Hosted my wedding here in February 2013!!! Most exquisite venue I have ever been to! Staff are so wonderful... a very welcomed change to the garbage service I have come across in Australia!!! Always have a smile on their faces... so attentive to what you may or may not need and friendly. The grounds are so beautiful all the guests loved it and said they would all come back to Qunci villas just to relax and chill. The wedding itself was more than I could have dreamed of. I had Wiwit help me plan the wedding and although a bit delayed in response I feel now that the delay is due to the large amount of experience these people have in hosting weddings at Qunci. There really isn't much to stress about as they do everything!I chose the BBQ dinner buffet menu. Seafood and meat was bbq'd straight at the venue and was delicious. The live band was so cute cos the singer had a very slight asian accent but it added to the whole experience and i loved it! They played nice acoustic songs such as Bruno Mars, Maroon 5 etc. I was a bit scared as I didn't know/see the band perform before asking for them but they were awesome! The wedding was held at Qusia Villa and the presentation was flawless! All you really need to do in order to hold the wedding is tell them your colour scheme and a general look of flowers and dinner menu and then all that remains is you rocking up to your wedding! I have uploaded photos of the wedding set-up mainly as the photos of the grounds are identical to that shown on their webpage. Believe me its beautiful!If you are ever looking to do an overseas wedding please consider this place! You will not regret it! Also if you are looking for a local photographer please chose the one we had as he was also outstanding! Everyone loved his photography! His name is Lingga and this is his facebook link:https://www.facebook.com/Lombok.WeddingPrice is very good! So i hope the message taken is don't be afraid to plan a wedding at a location you haven't been to before... I did and it was the most amazing night in my life :)Thanks to all the staff at Qunci villas for making me and my guests feel very welcome! We will be back for sure :)Sasha"

","Exquisite â¦ with a few negatives","This resort is everything its own website depicts and remains true to the pictures. The grounds are superb and the rooms are large, clean and elegant. I am easily pleased and loved the bathroom, particularly the rain shower.A word of advice. When checking in be sure to listen intently to the receptionist. They are a walking, talking compendium and endeavour to tell you everything about the hotel. With lightning speed and broken English, I missed most of it and was annoyed to find that there was no written compendium in the room.Another word of advice. If you book with an online booking agent because you are offered a better rate, expect to be disadvantaged. My room was the in worst possible position because of this (I called it the naughty corner). It was the furthest from the beach and was directly outside one of the two sub-receptions with the constant phone ringing starting to grate on my nerves. In fact, when my own phone rang they had to tell me as I just assumed it was theirs. As I was only staying two nights I didnât complain about it until check out and it was suggested I book direct next time.The staff are very well trained and versed in all the right answers, to the point of almost being robotic. The food is a gourmetâs delight and the chef needs to be applauded for his presentation and taste. Although, on two occasions my food was not prepared as requested or as stated on the menu.Two of the staff need to be awarded âbest in their positionâ. First is Muktiadi in the restaurant for his beaming, infectious smile at breakfast time and Putu in reception for his genuine caring of guestâs needs.On the recommendation of other reviewers, I booked Eko for a custom designed day tour. I was not disappointed and can also highly recommend him. Just be sure to reconfirm your details one or two days before. While he arrived for my pick up on the right day at the right time, he arrived with a boat as transport when I had arranged an inland tour of the island! And if you need good, reliable transport, contact Mahsun on 62 81 917 095 591"

","Favourite hotel in Indonesia","We stayed in three other top class hotels in Bali/Lombok/Gili and while they all surpassed our expectations, qunci villas is in another class entirely. PROS:- we only stayed 2 nights but wish we stayed more, very good value for money. Large bedrooms, bathrooms, and deck area. We stayed in a villa ith partial sea view and it was excellent!- the pool area is great. The main pool (of 3) is an infinity pool, roughly 40m long, great for relaxation and looking over the ocean or doing laps. - food is excellent!! A littl pricier than other hotels we've stayed at but we didn't want to even leave the complex (a guilty pleasure of a hotel)- staff was phenomenal. We had a late flight out of lombok and they allowed us to stay in the room until 3pm- already mentioned food, but rush to this hotel for lunch and order the BEEF RENDANG ROLL. Do it now, one of the best things I've had worldwide!- happy hour is a delicious trap (I spent too much money during this generous two hour window) but much appreciated- good wifi (Indonesia standards) in the whole facility (rooms, poolside, and restaurant). Great as I had a little work to take care of. CONS: - only thing I can think of is that the air conditioner is right above the bed. Climate control is a little hard to get the exact right temp to not be too cold or hot throughout the night. - we didn't have enough time to stay there. And there weren't enough lunches to eat the BEEF RENDANG ROLL. seriously that good :)"

The private pool was of a good size and depth, and the design of the room is nice and spacious.Staff are friendly, and helpful. Service levels were above our expectations.Although without a nice beach, the deck chairs over looking the sea allows you to sunbath comfortably. The sea water is crystal clear..... i had a swim in the sea, and later sun bathed on the sunbathing chairs in the hotel.Happy hours for drinks are from 5-7pm, which is great, because find the drinks at Quici a tad overpriced + the cocktails aren't great at all.Mainly european food in the restarants....food is great, but would like more indonesian food in the menu.Would stay in Qunci again the next time we visit Lombok!!"

Very happy with Diana, and my partner wad equally pleased with his! will be back in 2days time for their Early Bird specialFood : local indonesian food is very well done.Western dishes could be improved. not cheap but for the convenience of not having to leave the resort....Service Staff : excellent service, extremely helpful and most speak English really well. bravo!very happy overall (as you can sde I rated everythg Excellent)more reviews in a few days when we complete our stay! :pPS no worries about loud prayer calls and noise from construction next door - all unfounded allegations!

","A perfect place for an extremely decent price","During a one month trip in Indonesia, this was by far our favorite (while cheapest) hotel. Qunci is the kind of place where pretty much everything is perfect. The decor is amazing everywhere. The rooms are pretty and spacious and especially the outdoor bathroom is beautiful. I love that they chose to build villa's instead of ordinary hotel-rooms. They also do everything they can to keep your room mosquito-free which was very much appreciated. I was not stung once while being there. There are 3 gorgeous swimming-pools along the sea. Great choice to reserve one swimming-pool for adults only: this way we got to enjoy the quietness while parents with children don't have to be concerned with their children making noise in the main pool where children are allowed. Overall, the hotel has done everything to make sure that both families and couples can enjoy themselves. The only slightly annoying thing is the vendors that walk back and forth over the tiny strip of beach in between the hotel and the sea and will try to get your attention during the entire day by yelling at you. It makes you feel like you're constantly being watched while laying next to the pool and it makes it sometimes difficult to really relax. A great selection of bars and restaurants. Since there are different places to eat and have a drink, you don't feel like being in a big hotel. Great selection of food everywhere and extremely decently priced. Amazing selection of cocktails and mocktails that were cheaper and of better quality than anywhere in Indonesia. Tip: have dinner once at one of the private tables that are closer to the beach: it's extremely romantic.Perfect spa-experience where my Shiatsu massage was probably the best massage I ever had. Only problem in the spa is that there are mosquito's and my husband was severely bitten during a treatment. It's very convenient that when you want to go to Gili islands for a snorkeling trip (which is really a must), the boats are just laying next to the hotel so you don't need to leave the hotel to board. What I liked most about Qunci villa's was the staff. They were extremely friendly and much more relaxed than in most other places. They create an extremely soothing vibe just by being a little less formal and more sincerely cheerful and relaxed than in other places. I think that even though I'm not especially interested in visiting Indonesia again, I will once come back just for Qunci villa's and beautiful Lombok."

","Great happy hour, gorgeous sunsets","We stayed there as a family of four - 1 night in an ocean view room and 2 nights in a pool villa. The ocean view room was a bit small for the four of us but had a lovely balcony and being on the 2nd level gave us a better view than the ground floor rooms. The pool villa was very nice - not as nice as the one we stayed at in Bali but for less than half the price - I'm not complaining. The bathrooms have very nice open air showers. No bathtubs.The staff were friendly and smiling. Not much to do there for the children besides hang out at the pool but we did see quite a few other families with children staying there. My son had a great time collecting shells on the beach. The beach is very narrow. You can't really play or hang out on it. It is a black sand beach. It is not a private beach and there are a lot of hawkers and vendors who can be quite persistent and even annoying. The hotel organized a private trip to the Gilis for us by traditional boat. However the boatmen were not very friendly and gave us no information about the islands and their sights. They literally just took us to each island and a spot for snorkeling and the rest was left to us and the Lonely Planet guidebook. The snorkeling at Gili Trawangan was nothing special. Gili Air was marginally better. The equipment they had was not the correct size for our 8 year old. Our snorkelling experience in Thailand was much better.We are vegetarian and discovered that the Qunci room service menu has many more options for vegetarians than dining at the restaurant. One small issue with the room service is that they would always forget something - most often the cutlery and sugar for tea and coffee. The happy hour from 5 to 7 every evening is great with a selection of exotic cocktails. We really enjoyed this. The sunsets from the deck were absolutely spectacular. I would return just for those. My husband really missed having a fitness centre at the resort. In today's world that is an absolute must."

","Peaceful","Had a one bedroom pool villa for three nights. Gorgeous, large room with decking, pool lounges and umbrella. Maybe a tad more privacy would make it perfect.Comfy sleep. Easily adjustable aircon (I loathe hotel aircon). Fantastic art both in the room and throughout the Qunci property. Spa was a bargain with very knowledgable staff.We'd come from Gili T so it was such a pleasant change to feel comfortable sipping on a cocktail and knowing you weren't being poisoned. I don't feel the cost of food or drinks reflects the high standard of this property, very reasonable in price as we discovered with day-after happy hour hangovers :)The grounds are immaculate, public pools are a treat, sunset is sensational. Most of all, I want to thank the staff for supplying a TV in this non-TV property.....they allowed me to see my beloved Ravens win Super Bowl 47. Proved nothing was too hard for staff.Go if you want tasty, reasonably priced food and drink in a pretty lush setting."

","Slice of Heaven","We stayed here at the end of January 2013 for 5 nights. I was worried we would get bored but the tranquil atmosphere of this place soon envelops you. We had a Garden View Room, which was very private and spacious and perfect to retreat to when the thunder storms rolled through.I really can't fault this place, the service was attentive but not overbearing and always friendly. The grounds and pools are well planned to enhance privacy so even when there are a lot of people at the resort it still feels quiet.We took a day trip to the Gilis which were good but busy even in low season.We were originally planning on staying on Gili T until I found Qunci and our visit to the island confirmed that we'd made the right choice! We were sad to leave and are looking forward to returning soon!"

","Slice of heaven","First stayed here 4 years ago when I came for a holiday with someone I'd just met and came back again 4 years later to celebrate our 4th anniversary (yup, ended up getting attached to the guy! :-)). The place has grown! But it is still the same slice of heaven it was 4 years ago. The service is impeccable, the rooms are great, the pools are gorgeous and the food's pretty good too. Scott Coffey, you have done an amazing job with the place. My one tiny gripe being a gym bunny is the lack of a fitness centre. Don't need much, just some free weights and one of those combo machines. Anybody who wants some cardio can just go run on the beach or do laps in any one of your amazing pools!"

","Fantastic hotel, amazing location and very friendly staff","I spent 5 days at Qunci in February. I was in a garden view bedroom and I really loved the place.Every corner is furnished with a piece of art, from the 100-year totem to the stautes in the room. And this really creates a boutique hotel atmosphere, making the place unique.The room size is fair and the bathroom amazing with an open bathroom which allows you to see the blue sky and the palmtrees when you take your shower!The restaurants offer you fresh juices, cocktails, delicious seafood and a great variety of food using local and Mediterranean recipes. I personally loved the salads, squid salad or spicy papaya!Finally, the staff honors the Indonesian hospitality reputation by his friendliness, always making sure you are fine and paying attention to every single details.I do recommend Lombok and Qunci Villas as a substitute to Bali if you are looking for more authentic hotels, less crowded beach and a very good value for money."

","Wedding party: 2012/2013.","You will struggle to find fault with this resort, and the staff who support it. They are keen to make your stay as comfortable and as trouble free as possible. This was a new part of the world for me, and am glad to have made the effort to take part in a well organised event. QV managed to pull off a large wedding during a public holiday, and never put a foot wrong. I stayed a for a week, and on the way to the resort made a rookie error in not travelling with a back up credit card. Unfortunately the ATM's at Bali Denpasar and Indonesia work differently to Europe and deliver cash before the card. I withdrew funds and left my card behind, and only just manages to pay for my flight with Merpatti to Lombok. Having arrived at QV and explaining my dilemma I was immediately put at ease. The staff at QV arranged my return flight, and worked with me to settle my account with out any fuss. Fantastic. I must also mention my special thanks to a young member of their team called Nova. A delightful hotel employee, who you will quickly admire and rely upon to fix your every need. This was a trip I a life time, and one I'll never forget for all the right reasons. If you decide to make the trip, don't do as I did and fly to the resort without staying over in Bali. If you're travelling long haul it will drain you in trying to make the connecting flight. Have a rest, relax and allow plenty of time to make the short flight the next day. You can also ask QV to arrange a pick up at the other side to take you directly to the resort, and save you trying to arrange a taxi outside the busy airport once on the island."

","Unbelievably Beautiful Hotel!","We can't recommend this place highly enough. Having stayed in some amazing hotels around the world I have to say that Qunci Villas is one of the best, if not the best.The hotel itself is very modern and clean with wonderful views, and the whole place is finished perfectly with every tiny detailed accounted for.The staff are excellent and the food at the restaurants is top level. Also the breakfast choices are brilliant, I had Eggs Benedict most mornings.Stay here...you will not regret it!!"

","Great Place, great spaces. We're coming back!","Qunci is an immaculately kept and ideal resort for relaxation and pampering. On a local indonesian friend's recommendation we came to Lombok and skipped the more touristy Bali resorts - and we loved it - in future we both agreed we'd be come back here without hesitation.My wife and I stayed 5 days in total, we could not fault this resort for the type of ""couples"" holiday that we were looking for: Initially we stayed in the garden view room which was clean and very satisfactory considering it's the resort's lowest-end accommodation, the air con worked well and outdoor bathroom was a fun feature. On the final day we upgraded to a one bedroom villa for the private pool and enjoyed using this feature a lot, we ordered room service on a number of occasions (at no extra charge, including fresh green coconuts and rambutans - which arent even on the menu). Gardens and premises are immaculately kept: tropical green foliage abounds, flowers in bloom, sculptures and artwork in every nook. Makes the place feel extremely spacious and peaceful which we cannot understate the serenity of this. We took advantage of the well-priced and well-appointed spa/massage facilities daily (masseuses were well trained and capable, highlights included the couples rooms and the outdoor stone bath was a great unique feature).The only slight negative: we ate and used the resort's restaurants and bars on numerous occasions - food and drinks were average quality (catered to very bland western palettes in our opinion) and over-priced compared to the stuff you could get in nearby Sengigi (7 minutes away by taxi). Yessy cafe in Sengigi is recommended if you want to try some more true-to-Lombok type cuisines. We also ventured to Mataram, Lombok's largest city where the food and prices again were better (more flavoursome and better value) than Qunci and Sengigi."

","Best Resort In Lombok","We were greeted at the airport by the hotel pick up and the ride to the hotel took a little more than an hour.Check in was fast and everything was explained in a perfect manner.We were shown to our partial ocean view room and it was tidy and simple which i liked.It had an art decor concept to it which made me feel comfortable.I requested for a tv and they had it installed in 10mins.The hotel has beautiful grounds and they do a wonderful job with the upkeep.They have 3 different pools so its never crowded and there are enough deck chairs for everyone.The view from the pool is amazing.The beach is lovely with the soft black sand but unfortunately it is impossible to swim in the sea as there are big rocks and corals.I did try but gave up after awhile cause the rocks were hurting me. Breakfast was brilliant everyday with several choices to choose from and it was a wonderful start to the day.We had lunch several times in the hotel and it never failed to impress and we did try to have a romantic candlelight dinner by the beach but unfortunately we were rained out.What impressed me most about this hotel is the staff.They were gracious,attentive,helpful and always willing to go out of their way to help you.I give them 5 stars and the management should give themselves a pat on the back for instilling this spirit in the staff.If i had one bad thing to say about the trip, it would be about the hawkers peddling their merchandise.Its practically impossible to relax without being disturbed every 5 mins.I do understand that its their livelihood and i did buy stuff from them but it can get pretty annoying after awhile.Its definitely not the hotels fault and the vendors do go away after they realize that you're not interested. Quinci should be your first and only choice when visiting Sengiggi only because you get the best in every aspect of your stay."

","Perfect Villa","I was travelling with another family and we both had babies with us about 1 years old. We spent 5 days and the experience we had is unforgettable. I still have dreams waking up to our perfect ocean view from our room no. 50. What I loved about Qunci:1) This villa is truly art inspired by amazing artists from all over the world..South Africa, France, Holland just to name a few. The rooms, restaurants, setting and grounds are all so art inspired and gives a great feeling to it. The art made Qunci very unique from other villas I have been to. 2) The pools are great! They have 3 pools here. One was perfect to watch the sunset, the other we loved was the infinity pool and the last one was the adult pool next to the bar. They had such great chillout areas as well by the pool which was perfect for babies and families. A great big sofa under a wooden roof but feels like you are under a tree inspired by the tree branches that act as the pillars.3) Food is superb and reasonably priced too. Go for the barbeque and you will not be dissapointed. I loved how it was not a huge array of selections but more detailed and focused on what they offer best. Fresh snapper, tiger prawns and superb desserts!4) Service is great. We had breakfast served in our room daily! Cleaniless is first class around the resort.5) My daughter unfortunately had a fever when we were there and I was most impressed that they had a house call doctor to my room in 20 mins! No stress and the doc spoke good english.6) For surfers, Qunci villa is overlooking an amazing beach for surfing. They had great waves all the days we were there and it was nice watching the local boys surf especially in the sunset.7) The bathroom is just amazing. You are taking a shower in the open under the starts and sun! Honestly, you never have to leave the resort once you check in. It has everything to offer for a perfect holiday. However for more of an island feel I would recommend the Gili Islands for a daytrip. Qunci villa's can arrange a boat for you which takes 45 mins to get to the Gili's. Gili Air is the most pretty of the three. For a bit of local feel...you can try the Asmara restaurant which offers you pick up service door to door from Qunci. They have a nice shop next to it that sells jewellery and house decor. Sit under the hanging plants to dine under the stars and be serenaded by a live performance of a man with his guitar and harmonica. Qunci, what I would like to see the next time just to add a few more details that lacked in facilities provided in the room were:1) No room slippers2) No moisturiser3) No bathrobesThis is quite a standard offering in most boutique villas I have stayed in so would be great if you can offer them as well and it will be the complete package! Best Regards,Sophye Huet"

","You will never regret going","Stayed 4 nights on an Ocean View Villa and this is the best beach resort we have ever been too. It is hard to add much more to the other reviews but our highlights are - reasonable room, spa, food and drink prices, stunning rooms, clean sea, amazing design fetures of the resort, happy hour and service. We got the hotel to prvide transport to and from the airport - it is a 1hr trip and costs $30 each way - well worth it. It is hard to think of anyway to improve this place. We will be back for more very soon."

","STAY HERE, ENOUGH SAID!","This hotel is an ideal spot for a getaway vacation where you can avoid crowds of people, eat good food and enjoy good drinks at the on-site restaurants, and unwind at a superb spa. We live in Singapore and like many big cities it's important to get out for a long weekend every now and again. From now on, Qunci will be our top-choice!The good:1. Great restaurants that are affordable and have a wide selection of items. I think the steak was USD$17.50. And it was the most expensive item on the menu.2. Great drinks menu including well priced wine. 5-7pm happy hour. Nice!3. Fantastic spa. Perhaps the best we have visited in Asia and Europe. And it's cheap! USD$40 for 90 minute massage or USD$100 for a 3 hour mixed treatment. Dani is great!4. Comfortable rooms with indoor and outdoor lounging space. Get an Ocean View Room, you can't beat the view!5. Excellent staff. We had to rebook our flights and the staff at the front desk not only did the ticket change but also arranged for someone to go to the airport and pay the difference on our behalf all while we lounged by the pool. Top-notch!6. Interesting art scattered all over the hotel. The ceramist from South Africa is amazing. His pieces look 2-d until you get up close to them.7. Mixed crowd of guests from young couples, to old couples, and families. So it is good value for everyone.Bad (but not really)1. The A/C dripped, maybe 5 drops... ok I am stretching here. There really isn't anything bad to say about this hotel.STAY HERE!!!!"

","Doing it with class..!","I stayed at Qunci Villas for 3 days and have to say that I was impressed. Location is fantastic, staff is amazing and overall resort feel is top notch. Food is what impressed me the most during my stay. I stayed at many resorts in Indonesia and they all tend to look a like even though Qunci Villas is uniquely beautiful. Food selection has just enough fusion between local and western tastes and dishes that come out of kitchens truly taste great..a promise fulfilled. Kitchen Chef actually visits the guests and talks to them during service and i believe that is why they manage to perform well on the palate side of things. Eating in town can get a bit dicey (hit and miss on taste and safety) so sticking to the hotel is what i recommend. Chef is a canadian guy that obviously knows hot to make things happen in the right way... One thing I cant understand is why they have crappy 2$ telephones in rooms that are so impressive with obviously great effort, and money, invested in every details? Everithing except the phone. Strange. Mine worked...sometimes. Also: no fitness centre? hmmmm...something that needs to change very soon i think. it's an absolute must have these days..."

","'The hippest Hotel in Lombok'","The New York Times claims that Qunci Villa's is the 'Hippest Hotel in Lombok'. They are spot on. Everything in the resort is carefully considered to make your holiday feel as relaxing as possible. The added bonus of all the original modern artworks in the art corridor as well as throughout the hotel makes it feel extra special. The staff are attentive and go above and beyond without it feeling stifling. The three pools are gorgeous, each overlooking the beach front. The adults only pool in a great added bonus as are the many day beds. The beach is great, massive waves right at your front door (we stayed during the wet season) if you are interested in surfing or even just to admire the view.The food is outstanding. It is so good that it was known to be a favourite even of guests from the neighbouring hotels. The extensive menu's from the two restaurants combined with the tapas afternoon menu from the two pool bars makes sure to keep the food interesting. We stayed at Qunci for 5 nights and it still wasn't enough time to try all the dishes we fancied from the restaurants. We managed to try plenty of the cocktail list though thanks to the Happy Hour 2 for 1 cocktails between 5-7pm.We were in the cheapest room (Garden Room) and it was gorgeous. The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean and spacious, enhanced by the high traditional roofing style. The bathroom was a special feature with the outdoor rain shower in your very own bathroom garden. Another bonus was the lounging alfresco area on the front porch. We can't recommend Qunci Villa's highly enough. A big thank you to all the staff for making the last leg of our holiday so perfect."

The ambiance, vibes and romantic setting couldn't be better. Our room was very nice, although we wanted a open Balinese style open bathroom, we received a second floor room with a very nice and relaxing terrace instead.Tip: Reading lights would be appreciated as the room lights are too dim to read by.

","Top notch villas","Qunci villas exceeded our expectation even after reading glowing reviews from trip advisor. Staff was exceptionally friendly, accommodating and greeted us warmly. We stayed with our kids and parents, they managed to shuffle around the rooms so we were close together. And moved around the extra beds.Wifi was great, pools were amazing as we could see Mt Agung in Bali from the pools during clear days. Every night they organised activities, be it traditional dance, BBQ etc. Breakfast food was excellent and plenty of fruits to balance our diet thought our stay. Tips: close the bathroom door at all time to minimise Mosquitos, however the staff came in every evening to spray our rooms. Thus Mosquitos had not been a major issue. We stayed there from 8-11 Jan 2013. Ask for newer villas for more private and better furnishings.This property felt like private villas with 5 star staff, service and location. My parents who have had a fair share of travel around the world and staying at various hotels and resorts mentioned several times that this is one of the best place they have visited.Our only regret was we wished we could not stayed longer at Qunci."

","Superb beach hotel","Qunci Villas is 10 minutes away from the centre of Sengiggi by car. However, taxis are frequent and relatively inexpensive - Rp14,500 for the trip.The hotel is relatively minimalistic. There are no TVs (no great loss) but no tea-making facilities and no information in the rooms. The bedroom is fairly large and there is a separate toilet with an outside shower. There are no walls between the toilet and shower so the area can get wet during rainstorms and noise travels in both directions! A balcony with decent couch and seating completes the facilities.There are 2 restauarant areas catering for the many people in the complex and in addition snacks are available at the pool bar. There are 2 large pools either side of the restaurant areas overlooking the sea, with the beach just over the edge.The gardens are superbly kept and staff are attentive without pushing the envelope of customer service.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and spent much time in the pool areas. Sengiggi does not have a lot to offer and Qunci represents an ideal spot for honeymooners or simply to relax."

","Relaxed and full","We had a wonderful stay at Qunci. We arrived one day early then our booking, and ended up staying 3 days more because we loved it so much. After leaving the Gili's and their not so great food, we were in heaven to see the lunch menu here. I have never eaten a better hamburger. Chef Bryce and his crew make everything so delicious. There was lots of seafood on the dinner menu's at both restaurants. That would be my only comment would be to add a few more non seafood items. Rooms were very clean, spacious and quiet. Loved the outdoor shower. Make sure you request the newer rooms. Staff were always friendly and eager to please. Happy hour here is awesome- 2 for 1. Bartender Jay makes the BEST pina colada's I have ever had. Loungers by the pool are comfortable, and pool is so cool and clean. Beach here was unexpectedly nice and we were able to swim, surf and walk the 2-3km length of deserted beach. Lombok was such a nice change from the hustle and bustle of busy Bali. We organized tours through the hotel to waterfalls and the south beaches of Lombok. Amazing value for what you get. Definitely recommend this hotel over and over."

","Wonderful getaway","The villas are an hour and a half away from the new airport, on the less populated west coast.In keeping with the concept of boutique villas, the rooms were decorated with art pieces tastefully arranged, even in the bathrooms. There is no television but has free WiFi. The bathroom is huge and has a private courtyard, making one feel showering in the open. Mature plants around the room provide privacy from neighbouring villas and one can sit quite comfortably outside on the verandah or balcony. The villas are close to the beach and has three swimming pools and a spa although it is a tad expensive compared to the ones in town. The numerous deck chairs dotted around allow one to relax, indulge in cocktails whilst watching the beautiful sunsets. The sun does sink that fast as in the movies!The food is excellent and bountiful. One has a choice of breakfast in one of their two restaurants, have it outside your villa or in bed. There seems to be a lack of fresh milk and one has to use their evaporated milk or drink it black. For other meals, one may have to wait a while for the food to be cooked and served. Having said that they were well presented and we did not get any tummy upsets.The staff is attentive, friendly and service is prompt if some matter needs attending to. We booked some activities through reception. There are no structured children activities and no recreational or fitness centres. This is a holiday for those who just want to relax. We celebrated New Year there and the staff went all out to make that a memorable occasion for everyone. The ponds were decorated lights and the restaurant was decorated with orchids and they even had their own fireworks at midnight.The villas are about 10 mins by taxi to Senggigi town and it costs about"

","Great views, gardens and food.","Just returned from 2 nights at Qunci Villas. My wife and I had an upstairs Garden view room which was very nice with a great balcony. The food at the hotel restaurant was amazing we had lunch and dinner on both days and are sorry we didn't have longer to try all the meals on the menu. The level of English of the restaurant staff varies and resulted in a few minor mix ups with orders so just ensure you confirm your order closely, the staff were great and try very hard.Although no fault of the hotel the call to payer from the local Mosque was a bit more frequent and louder than what I had read about in other Tripadvisor reports. The calls start at about 4:15 am and go for about 30 minutes, loud enough to wake you fully, then again at around 3:00pm, then again at around 6:00pm and finally again at about 9:00 pm.We travelled Wings/Lion Air from Bali which we booked online only a short flight 30 min, taxi to Senggigi from the airport takes around 1 1/2 hours and costs about 200,000rp. A car booked from the hotel costs about 300,000rp but no worrying or waiting for a taxi."

","Bed bugs bites and slippery staircase fall.","The room that we stayed in, which is the garden room, were clean however even with the mosquito coil in our room, both of us still got ourselves bitten by them(by the end of the trip, we had a total of 20 bites). We stayed on the second floor and there was once when it was raining heavily, my partner slipped and fell to the ground on the flower bed, due to the slippery steps. Some staff are friendly but most of them are more friendly towards the Caucasians and Indonesians but neglected the rest of the Asians. When we requested for a room after we've checked out, one of the staff was complaining over the phone in front of me, not realizing that I understood her language. That is very rude. The breakfast was fantastic and the view from the restaurants are awesome(facing the beach)but we did not enjoyed dinning at all the restaurant due to too many flies hovering over our food and us. And the check-out time, we think that if a guest requested for a late check-out, it should be looked into seriously instead of saying 'the rooms are full' and promised to give us a room to shower an hour before we leave but instead gave us a shower stall half an hour late, and the staff aren't even apologetic about giving us the shower stalls late. Reason ask for late check out was having injured ankle and back due to fall.. Overall staying at Qunci is recommended if you will only be in Lombok for short period of time."

","Very comfortable place to stay","The rooms are comfortable and the air conditioning works well. As many have mentioned, there is not a lot of privacy in the garden view rooms, and I was thankful for having an upstairs room so that we could enjoy our breakfast on the balcony without feeling like ALL eyes were on us. The layout seems to be a bit confusing because not only did we nearly enter the wrong room at one point, someone made the same mistake with us and walked in on me naked! So you may want to take the precaution of locking your door... :)The room is not perfectly sealed against bugs, but someone left a Baygon plugin running in our room while we had dinner, which kept the room well protected. There was one roach on it's back when we woke up, so the Baygon must have done it's job. Another two in the bathroom. Maybe not for the super-squeamish, but in that case why come to Indonesia? The pools are great and the adult pool is a nice touch.We had breakfast delivered to our room one day, and then in the restaurant on day two. The range of food on offer is ok, but it's a little hit and miss: I had the Huevos Rancheros on the first morning and they were pretty bland. They came with a stingy smear of rather weak salsa and a small amount of refried beans. On the second day I had the eggs Benedict, which had a generous amount of hollandaise and tasty turkey ham. There was a large piece of eggshell in it though, which is fairly careless. However, it was the better of the two breakfasts. They also came with some fruit, a juice and a coffee, which was all nice enough, but the coffee was lukewarm on both days.For dinner on the first night we signed up for the $48 BBQ. It was a little over-priced, but enjoyable. Lovely smokey meat and fish and a nice range of vegetables/salad. The deserts were yummy and you'll want to try them all! Pre-dinner cocktails are good value, during happy hour, but possibly too much ice in them: if you don't guzzle them down quickly they'll get diluted. Particularly good are the Moscow Mules, which have a lovely, refreshing gingery kick to them!The service is fair. They are eager to please but can be forgetful: sometimes asking for a menu led to smiles but not much else."

","A wonderful and luxurious holiday spot","We have just stayed on Lombok and chose the Qunci Villa Resort. This was a wonderful decision. The place is georgous, with pleasant, friendly staff, great food and luxury accomodation, from the private balconies to the immaculate gardens and great attention to detail. We tried scootering around, hired a boat with Bahram, who took us to Gilis where we saw and played with turtles while snorkelling, surfing in the gentle waves (great if you are a beginner-not for the experienced) and visited the spa in the villas every day. It was well priced and a fantastic place to stay. Good choice of food if you wanted to dine in and good selection of places to eat. i.e. the pool, garden, beachfront or restaurant. Three infinity pools and one big enough to do laps. Well done Qunci.!Lynne and Paul C"

","Perfect villa for a quiet holiday","We were looking for a quiet and uninterrupted holiday, away from the buzzles and confusions in the city. Qunci villas was perfect. It only had a number of villas, so unlike a hotel it only had several rooms to rent. But it was perfect. It even had it own spa which was lovely. Breakfast was really really yummy and the service was uber friendly. Well worth the extra money!"

","A gem in Sengigi","Room:The villa is very nice. It has a nice size private swimming pool. The shower is open air, so you really need to close the bathroom door so you won't get any mosquitoes. The only complain I have with the villa is the privacy; people can take a peek at our villa from the neighbouring rooms.Restaurant/BarI am not crazy about the restaurant. The food is not authentic. They tone down the spices to the point that the food doesn't taste how it's supposed to be. The breakfast is good, but I'd suggest going somewhere else for dinners. We had 4 dinners there, I only found one dish that I like (vietnamese spring rolls). The cocktails do not have enough alcohol, so if you order a flavored martini you may want to order a shot of vodka on the side :)Amenities:There are three common pools, one is adult only. They are rather small, but they're nice. The bad is... there is NO gym. It's also hard to go for a jog at the beach as the beach is quite wet and narrow. Services:Excellent. I'd recommend the transfer from the hotels as taxi can be a bit hard to get from the hotel.Spa:I had the best spa experience. The treatment room is great and the therapist was professional and well trained. The three hour treatment is to die for. I won't recommend papaya wrap though; it stinks :)"

","Beautiful","One word to describe it: WOW!I loved this place. it was very beautiful and it has such an amazing view! I loved the infinity pools, there are 3 pools you can choose in this villa. At first I was a bit sceptical with the idea of having outdoor shower. I was scared of the insects that might crawl around you while you're showering. But there were no insects and there's no mosquito! We have been staying in other hotels in Lombok the previous nights and we were invaded by mosquitoes! And it was such a pleasant surprise that there was no mosquito around the villas. <3 The breakfast was already included and it was amazing, I ordered the pouched eggs, marvellous and delicious - highly recommended. There are 2 restaurants in the villa area (if I'm not mistaken) and you can choose which restaurant you want to have your breakfast, but I believe they offer the same kind of food just in different area. There was also one lounge in the villa, but you could order your drinks and sit by the beach. It was lovely and breathtaking. Let me warn you though that there were many hawkers roaming around the beach area (but they won't enter the villa area), they may shout at you from a distance while you're having your lunch at the restaurant or sunbathing near the pool area. But don't worry, they won't disturb you that much, just ignore them and they'll be gone (*fingers crossed*). Highly recommended."

","Great place, service from excellent to poor.","Qunci Villas have a fantastic location, the rooms are gorgeous, the spa is fantastic and the staff are friendly. The food was good, but not special. Breakfast is offered in your room, but our order sheet was not picked up from our balcony as stated, meaning we had to squeeze in breakfast in the restaurant, which we had not allowed time for. The safe was not working, and though we were told someone would come to fix it, no one did. These are just small things, but for one of the most expensive hotels on Lombok, these are things that should run smoothly. The location was so lovely, though, that I wish we'd had more time to stay longer."

","Really lovely Lombok hotel","Now the new Lombok airport has opened, it's a bit more of a trek to get to Sengiggi. However, it's definitely worth the 1.5-2 hours once you arrive at Qunci Villas. Mostly 2 storey, 2 guestroom villas, in very well looked after and manicured gardens with three swimming pools separating hotel from beach. Nice size villa rooms, with large double beds, outside veranda, and inside/outside bathrooms. Some rooms come with their own pools but they're not completely private and some of them won't get much sun. With plenty of poolside places, we felt having your own pool was unnecessary. Great views out to sea and, certainly in November, some surfing to be done.Happy hour (well 2 hours actually!) meant 2for1 cocktails at the covered but outdoor bar area, and there's a fabulous selections of small nibbles to be had that are very reasonably priced.Two restaurants next to each other with two different menus. They tried to differentiate between them but hard to spot and you could choose from whichever menu you wanted at either restaurant. You could eat at tables by the beach if you wanted too. Food was very good and tasty, albeit on the first night the main course arrived just as we'd finished the previous one! As in almost everywhere on Lombok and Bali, the staff were lovely, friendly and helpful, so asking for a gap between food courses achieved what we wanted.Our spa treatment was very good and very good value.Overall, a very nice, relaxed place that we enjoyed 5 nights at.We found a day trip to the Gili islands was easy from here, as were a couple of road trips in our rented car. Driving is definitely very different to the UK, but we soon got used to the different rules of the road! A lot of scooters and motorbikes and it takes much longer to get places than we imagined."

","Excellent and value for money","I travelled for business week-in week-out for the last 3 months and was looking for a getaway that would refresh me. We almost made our way to Bali for a fourth time before deciding that Lombok would be a change. I switched after my wife furiously rejected the idea of Bali (again!).I fell in love immediately with the photos of Qunci Villas and the reviews here on Tripadvisor, and confirmed our choice, just 1 week before our actual flight.We finally stayed 5 nights in Room 70 with partial ocean view. It was such a relaxing week. The estate is well maintained, appropriately lighted to set the romantic ambience at sunset/night, food was excellent and with much value in the prices, infinity pool provides picture-perfect view.We were really delighted with the service. Where even engineering department helped with our luggage when they incidentally were passing by our villa when we were about to check out. My wife who works in the hospital industry in the past for 6 years, especially noted that this does not happen at her prior 5-star employer.Spa was wonderful as well! All in all, nothing is sub-standard!I will definitely come back here for another relaxing holiday."

","Amazing","This place is awesome. I stayed in two bedrooms with pool (Qima if I'm not mistaken). Room is comfy and clean. I slept really well there.The only thing that didn't meet my expectation is the privacy of our room. The room next door (top floor) can see directly at our private pool. And there are also spaces between the walls in front of our pool, so people can see inside. It's just a little below my expectation.Bathroom is large and clean.Service is good, breakfast is good (not a buffet).I enjoyed my time there and will definitely go back someday."

","Wow.","The evening walk from reception to our room was fantastic. The resort had floodlit the beach, and the white caps rolling in look amazing. The small lights all over the place made the place look really intimate. As you wander down the gently lit paths around the resort, it just seems so peaceful.The room was great, spacious, with the pool literally outside our door. We sat out on the balcony and enjoyed a cold drink, listening to the sea and relaxing. Just wonderful. It was an ocean view room. The outdoor bathroom was okay, but it was covered with a misty perspex due to construction work next door - so it really wasn't quite the same. (But understandable).Breakfast was included, and we sat down on the tables at the edge near the beach. It was great to be able to watch the sea, and enjoy a nice meal. The Mee Goreng became a firm favourite at our table. The waiters were great, Suhandi was particularly friendly and remembered our names from the first time we met. That was really a nice touch. The view from the pool at sunset was great, and no two nights were the same. We enjoyed more than a few cocktails during happy hour.It was our friend's 40th birthday so the trip was a celebratory trip, and we couldn't have been happier, we were able to arrange a cake, and she was also surprised with a cake on the day too. The spa was really relaxing and we took the opportunity to have spa package prior to us heading back to the airport. A great way to fill in some time between checkout and departure. We kind of smelt like coffee and spice!The resort is around 10 minutes from Sengiggi and is easily reached by taxi. There are some great restaurants and places to enjoy a drink in town if you want to explore other options.Just worth noting that if you arrive from the international terminal at the airport, the taxi counter is inside the domestic arrivals area. It can be a little frustrating to find it when you don't quite know where to look."

","Wonderful stay...","We stayed at Qunci Villa (garden view room) for 4 nights and it was an absolutely great place to stay in lombok! Why i love this place:1. Room is comfortable and clean, outdoor shower is so cool.. Its simply less than 5 min away from the ocean view room, so the garden view room is more worth the price and more private.2. WIFI works everywhere in the resort.3. The view is simply gorgeous! There are plenty of sunbeds, so its great to simply chill by the pool, order a beer and relax... 4. Food is fantastic! I love the breakfast with the great view- had eggs benedict for 2 days! enjoyed all our meals here.. 5. Spa is simply value for money! US$30 for 1 hour massage, no complaints! 6. Staff are so polite, all of them will greet you when they see you. Overall, a great stay and I will definitely go back again."

","Fantastic value for money","We stayed 4 nights in Qunci this month and I have to say it was really great experience. We also stayed at Jeeva Klui, which was absolutely lovely as well-but they have totally different style. We are planning to go back both of the properties. Anyway-Qunci is quite chic and has absolutely relaxing feeling while being totally 5 star, very special mix of things.First thing I noticed when we arrived was that everything is spotlessly clean, you could even smell hint of lemon fragrance in the air when you enter the main yard from the reception area. Every day there were several people fixing the smallest details in the gardens, to make them look beautiful. Rooms are really,really good.We stayed in the most pocket friendly option Garden Room and even those were great. Spacious and good bed and lovely outdoor bathroom.They have really focused to make the pool area fabulous. Which it really is! You will spend most of your time there for sure, that is why I think whatever room option is good. Like previous reviews say, there are three big swimming pools facing the ocean. There is quite big waves in this beach, which are lovely to look at and you have constant warm wind from the sea. And that is a good thing under the hot Lombok sun, believe me! It cools you off a little bit. Sunbeds are super, soft and comfortable. There are couple of gazebos where you can take a nap, if you are lucky to get one for yourself. There were no noisy children, ( there was actually only one child during our stay ) no noisy music or anything disturbing at all. Or some people might find the local beach sellers a bit annoying- but do not bother. Those people are absolutely great when you talk with them and they will give you all kinds of tips what you can do in Lombok. We hired a guy and a captain to take us the Gilis and we went snorkeling in front of all the 3 islands and saw turtles and thousands of colourful fishes. We had a walk in Gili Meno and lunch in Gili Air. It took us all day and it we had great time.We payed 500 000 IDR for that and we thought it was good price. Make sure you have captain for the boat and one person as guide,then you will see the most. Our guide was great,called Souki and he was like fish in the water and knew exactly where to find those turtles that we wanted to see. We saw many of them and we even got to touch them gently while swimming with them.And what comes to the sellers we think it is great that mostly they are selling hand made items, not plastic crap. And the massage ladies are nice and they offer very good and cheap beach massages in front of Qunci.Mostly everything in Qunci is flawless but one thing was a bit inconsistent; The Food.I orderd every day fresh ginger tea,which I love, and some days it was a big pot with cookies and some days small pot with no cookies ;). Always the same price though.I hope they would make more effort with the non-alcoholic coctails, they could have more taste in them.I also hope they would start using more spices and adding more flavours into the dishes. Now most of the dishes were little bit bland, unfortunately. I always requested to have them spicy, but it did not help. I have to admit that we can call ourselves quite of a foodies-we like to eat in the best restaurants and we really appreciate great food and beautiful display of it. I do not mean that the food is bad here, of course not,but I think it really could be so much better if they would decide to really have a look into it. Maybe next time we will taste some improvements!The breakfasts were good-super Mie Goreng! And deserts were also very nice.Service was always delight-I want to point out our last evening. We were having a dinner in the beach when one of the staff members came to tell us that he had seen few turtles swimming just in front of Qunci. He said we could see them too if we would be lucky. So nice small gesture which we really appreciated. And we spend an hour spotting the little guys in the sea under the moonlight after our dinner.Qunci almost has it all and I would recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat. Exceptional place!Thank you for everything- we can not wait to come back.."

","romantic, blissful honeymoon","i went for a honeymoon trip this mid november 2012 for 4 days and 3 nights. I took a honeymoon package from weddingku and they promise that the Qunci Villa staff will take care of everything. from the get go we had a hotel staff pick us up by the airport with a comfortable transportation and hand us a soda and cold towel. upon arrival they welcome us with a drink and take us to our hotel room which was arrange nicely with flowers, we also received a honeymoon cakes which made my husband more excited and amazed. the staff were also nice enough to keep a secret of the honeymoon package from my husband (he found out about the romantic dinner though, bummer). at the afternoon we took a wonderful spa with our chosen aromatic oil. the massage was great but too bad i had a bad stomach and the room was quite windy with the ceiling fan so i wasn't fully enjoyed it. after the massage the staff prepared us a flower bath and a ginger drink. sublime.at the second day we took tour to 3 Gili islands. my husband had fun snorkeling and feeding the fish and the view was amazing and the owner of the boat was also nice and friendly. the only unpleasant thing about the tour was the long way back to the hotel. the weather was cloudy and the tide is high. i had a seasick and severe stomachache.the third day we had a romantic dinner, set up quite private at the top of the spa. it was due of the rain and the fully booked seats but it happened to be secluded and more intimate with the flower arrangements and candles. I picked the menu recommend by the staff. I wasn't really satisfied due to the seasoning of the seafood which i found too bland compare to its appearance.other than that:i only wish that Qunci had more breakfast menu choices. I also found the spices in each dish was quite bland, much to my taste. in our room there is no shower near the toilet so i had quite the trouble washing after i'm done."

","Really worth it","We had a great stay here (2D3N). I agree with all other reviews so won't spend too much time on the positives, except to say that our boat trip to the Gili Islands was the highlight: beautiful, terrific, wonderful and lots of other good things. It cannot get much better than swimming with turtles! And all staff were really great.Couple of slightly negative points / comments: - you can see the inside of most rooms from the alleys you walk on - better close your curtains - there is just one vegetarian option at lunch and one for dinner... Both are nice but they quickly get old, especially the Gado Gado that you've already been eating every day since you arrived in Indonesia. - despite the great experience of snorkeling around the Gilis, I wonder how long the coral will survive.. you see a lot of boats anchoring in the coral, people feeding the fish with bread, being careless with their palms breaking the coral etc. There's no briefing on how to be careful and I really hope the hotels will do their best to preserve this beautiful heritage (it's in their interest after all) - there was a slightly weird statue in our bathroom.. I know it's local art, but a representation of a man holding his penis in front of the shower and toilet was...err...odd."

","So relaxing!","My wife and I had our wedding and 2 weeks in Bali, so when it came to the honeymoon, Qunci was perfect. Bali can get a bit crowded, busy and you don't really end up relaxing. But once we checked into Qunci we immediately unwound.The setting is wonderful, right on the beach for some stunning sunsets - pop down at happy hour for some great cocktails.We stayed in a beachfront room with a great view of the ocean - The rooms are simple, but are exactly what you need.The staff are so friendly, particularly our waiter by the pool - Ahmad. He is very helpful and always up for a chat, which we loved. I highly recommend a day trip to the Gili's with Bahram. Bahram works on the beach out the front of Qunci, just look for the muscliest man in Indonesia! He was recommended to us by a friend an he was an absolute legend. He takes you out to all of the Gili islands for snorkeling and lunch. We saw two huge turtles and fed the fish - great trip. The people of Sengiggi are all so friendly, I ended up playing soccer with the local kids everyday over the road from Qunci - one of the greatest experiences of my life. Oh and they also have the best Mie Goreng that my wife and I have found in Indonesia! In fact, all of the food was amazing. We loved the seafood BBQ on the beach.The other thing to mention is the price - the best value I've ever seen from a hotel by far.Thanks for a great honeymoon Qunci, we hope to be back one day.Ant and Cindy"

","R & R at Qunci but beware the nearby mosque","We (family of 5) stayed at Qunci in July 2012 after a hectic, but fun week in Bali. With 3 girls wanting to shop their hearts our in Bali, I was ready for a break. And Qunci provided it. The staff are in abundance and while not the most polished and proficient in English, they're all very eager to please. The food, was good - traditional Indonesian meals were definitely the best and the kids were always catered for. Having a sunset drink overlooking the strait toward Mt Agung on Bali was magical - and every night was the same, BLISS! The only downside to our stay was the morning call to prayer from the local mosque which is only 50 metres away from the Hotel. If you don't mind waking at 5am every morning (one morning was 4.30am and the calls can last for 1.5hrs!!) the upstairs villa/room overlooking the bay is something special with its lovely large balcony. Otherwise ask for a downstairs room (no view, but at least you can have a sleep in) or better still ask for a room at the south side of the property away from the mosque. The beds were comfortable and shower was strong, so that's a bonus.A day trip to the Gili Islands is a must, with Gili T just like Bali was 20 or 30 years ago. We hired a boat out the front of the hotel (snorkel gear included) with the trip taking about an hour each way.Qunci definitely a relaxing place and all our family loved it. The day spa is worth a visit - Devine!!"

The resort is small and serene right on the beach. The walk to breakfast along the path that leads to the beach was beautiful every time. Having breakfast brought to our deck to eat by our pool was lovely too. The food is excellent. The cocktail happy hour is the perfect way to end the day watching the sun set and the amazing colours reflect onto the infinity pool and the sea. The staff are incredibly friendly and the spa treatments unmissable - I had a different one everyday. In a word, go."

","First class staff and facility","The Qunci more than lived up to our expectations of what constitutes a first class beach vacation! The staff are all very caring and competent, the grounds are beautifully laid out and immaculately maintained and the food is reasonably priced and of excellent quality. The spa provides world class treatments at reasonable prices in a lovely setting. We also suggest getting a couples massage on the beach from the local community at the low price of 100,000 rupiah ($10 US). For the sailors who want a truly local experience, we suggest going out on a traditional sailboat located a few hundred yards from the hotel along the beach ( crude but fun if you like to experience how local fisherman travel without burning up non-renewable resources, ask for Mat who is an excellent captain, and mariner).We also suggest contacting Leko Holidays for wonderful tours of the island."

","Stunning, perfect, would not disappoint the hardest to please..","Qunci villas is absolutely divine. For a nice break I holy recommend. Cruising the island on motorbikes is also very easy and can be hired for around $4 a day. There is no where near as much traffic and Bali and the roads are fairly quiet so it is a beautiful island to escape for a break and beautiful scenery.We loved Qunci and thought all the rooms were beautiful. We stayed in a one bedroom pool villa and it was divine. However the hotel pools are so perfect and located on the beach (there are 3 of them) so you really don't need a pool villa. Next time I would just book a standard room as many of them have gorgeous views over the ocean.Qunci will not disappoint."

","If you go to Lombok, stay here","The rooms are of a good size. We had a ground floor room, partial ocean view. This meant we had a lot of privacy as we were slightly further back from the main pool area. However our outdoor bathroom was huge. The design of the hotel is very clever. The food was excellent but you have to be very clear with your ordering, so that the restaurant staff get it correct. The fresh juices were delicious. The beach is good and if you walk further up, you will find black volcanic sand! The staff are very attentive, and you can enjoy breakfast on the wooden decking right by the beach.. It's so easy to get a taxi to Sengiggi so you can always go and try other restaurants etc. We organised a 1 day excursion with bluebird taxis to the waterfalls, and Tiu Kelep was unbelievable. Be prepared to cross some gentle rapids and climb some rocks but definitely go for a dip! We also did a 1 day diving trip to the Gili Islands, and they pick you up straight from the hotel. If you want to explore Lombok, this is a great hotel to use as a base. The spa was fantastic and very good value. Quinci Villas is excellent value for money, and would recommend all to try the Lumberjack breakfast!"

","Stylish, Immaculate Island Getaway","When you first arrive at Qunci Villas the clean, stylish lines of the grounds and facilities are immediately apparent. The pattern continues when you arrive at your room. The furniture is modern, functional and comfortable. Likewise at poolside and in the bar and restaurants, all of which are within an easy walk. Breakfast (included in our room rate) was from a menu, rather than a buffet, and arrived hot and tasty. We rarely ate lunch at QV (scuba and other outings) but had dinner at the bar and at each of the restaurants and were never disappointed during our 7-day stay. The bar has a 2-for-1 happy hour from 5 to 7, and you can make a meal of it, with tasty salads and hot dishes from the bar menu and desserts from the main restaurant. Service was exceptionally good. The clientele was from the four corners of the earth, testament to the well-deserved international reputation the QV has earned.Moving on now to a few considerations that may be important to certain travelers: 1) No TV, which came as a mild surprise as we surveyed our room, and continued when we visited the restaurants and bar and other public areas - no TV anywhere, so BYO electronic entertainment.2) Unfortunately the WiFi was slow and unreliable, out for two full days following a mild rainstorm. Speed was slow in our room, better in public areas. 3) No fitness center, aside from massage. But two of the three pools are long enough to swim laps (roughly 30 meters) and were uncrowded in the mornings. 4) The beach was not suitable for swimming or snorkeling. At high tide, it was a surfing beach, with breakers running 30 or 40 meters to shore. At low tide, roughly 50 meters of exposed rock were visible, including one particularly large rock that surfers would do well to avoid. 5) And for families with children, you should know that all three of the pools are about 1.5 meters / five feet deep. There are steps for easy entry, but the water will be over the heads of many children. 6) Beach hawkers were present dawn to dark, but seldom aggressive."

","Qunci Villas exceeded our expectations!","We just arrived home from an amazing week in Lombok staying at Qunci Villas. The holiday was for my birthday, and 2 of our friends joined us. My husband and I stayed in room 23 which we named the brochure room as this is the ocean view room used on the Qunci website. The service was exceptional - all the staff were very friendly and always willing to do whatever they could to make your stay enjoyable. The food amazing - fantastic selection, and always fresh and delicious! The outdoor shower was a lovely touch in the room - loved it. I spent a few days at the Day Spa - service was amazing. I highly recommend the spice bath - I felt so spoilt. I also had a massage from the massage ladies in the hut on the beach front. This was very cheap for 100,000 Rp ($10). It was only 15,000R ($1.50) for the short taxi ride in to Senggigi.The staff were so lovely in giving me a birthday cake and all singing when they brought the cake out to me. Such a lovely touch and a lovely day!We loved Qunci so much we have just booked our flights for another week there in September 2013.We cannot recommend Qunci highly enough!!"

","What a nice surprise!","After visiting Bali for 4 days, staying at Qunci Villas at Lombok was simply a spectacular surprise. Even though the hotel is open for several years, it felt very new, grounds were beautiful, with manicured gardens, frangipani trees, grafted orchids, fruit trees, 3 beautiful pools right next to beach, and only a few steps away from the ocean, and most of all feel of a Miami hotel. The hotel itself is on the beach and only a few steps away the ocean. Though the sand is very rough, and has corals, the water is very beautiful and clean.Top 3 things I liked:1) Happy Hour from 5 -7: 1 for 1 cocktails made out of everything fresh, totally delicious. You sit next to the beach listening to sound of the waves watching the beautiful sunset.2) Spa - Inexpensive and really good. You can also get a massage on a nice bed by the beach by locals, but this is not as good as going to the spa. If you are stressed from work, try the head massage for 30 minutes, they also do head and shoulder massage. Then have your lunch, or cocktails in a beach chair by the beach, you will forget about all your stress.3) Service and ambience - The service staff everywhere smiled, very helpful. My parents are vegetarian, the Canadian chef went out of his way to make special dishes for us. Also recommended nearby restaurants where we can get good food.Downside - place is really not for toddlers, the pool is too deep (1.6 meters). Though kids are welcome, they even have a kids menu, but if you are planning for a holiday with kids who expect to swim, get a one or 2 bedroom with pool villa (we had a 2 bedroom), so at least you can watch the kids in a smaller pool. My 2 nieces had a great time, as they could go to the pool anytime, and plenty of us were always around. Besides, it is a romantic place with a lot of couples, so I don't think noisy kids who run around will be appreciated by guests who are there for a quite peaceful romantic beach holiday. I would recommend it to couples, close friends, and couples with small kids (below 1-2 years)."

","Just how a holiday should be!","I had read all of the positive reviews prior to our stay at Qunci Villas so knew I was going to enjoy it, but all of my expectations were completely exceeded! My boyfriend and I stayed here for 4 nights in October.From the moment we arrived (and received a lovely complimentary welcome drink) the staff were very friendly, helpful and seemed genuinely keen to make sure we had everything we needed. We stayed in a garden bungalow which was great value for money - it was spacious, with huge comfy bed, lovely balinese decor and a beautiful outdoor bathroom - i was initially dubious about this given my bug phobia(!) but we found that the hotel was maintained so well that we hardly encountered any creepy crawlies :) and i was really glad that we had it.Qunci's grounds are gorgeous with 3 infinity pools to choose from. Located on Mangsit beach, this is a quiet, pretty stretch with great sunsets over Bali and not much around which made our stay relaxing and tranquil which was just what we were looking for. You have a couple of hawkers on the beach but nothing too invasive at all. There were surf lessons taking place on the beach each morning which were enjoyable to watch. The nearest town is Sengiggi, which is a 5 minute taxi ride away, we visited but found it to be a bit run down and actually preferred Mangsit.Food was delicious, we generally don't tend to eat only in the hotel, but it was so good and had such variety that we were drawn to it most evenings. They seemed to have different themes each night and you can have a nice romantic dinner right on the beach which was nice. Complimentary breakfasts had a good choice and were always served with fresh fruit and juices. Happy Hour takes place every eve with buy one get one free drinks so we took advantage of their array of cocktails.The hotel arranged a daytrip for us to visit Sendang Gile (waterfalls), about a 2 hour scenic drive away in Senaru village at the foot of Mount Rinjani which I thoroughly recommend. We could have done with more time here to visit some other sites in Lombok too. We had a full body massage in the Spa which was lovely and super relaxing, the next day we got treated to a complimentary neck and shoulder massage too whilst by the pool!One minor point worth noting is that it is located close to a mosque which has a call to prayer early every morning (4am) which was pretty loud, whilst it didn't really bother us if you are a light sleeper or have young children it is worth being aware of.All in all our stay at Qunci was perfect, so relaxing with a team of staff that are a complete credit to the hotel. I would not hesitate in recommending to anyone."

","Amazing Honeymoon at Qunci Villas","We arrived at night wondering where we were following three flights and a rather âexcitingâ taxi ride from the airport. We were woken the following morning by the noise of torrential wind and rain only to find when we opened the curtains that our room overlooked the sea and the noise we heard was the crashing of the waves - beautiful. The start of an idyllic honeymoon! We had a very relaxing honeymoon and didnât venture out of the resort much. The spa was good value with excellent service. We can recommend a boat trip to the nearby Gili Islands â negotiate a deal with one of the boat owners on the beach. The snorkelling was amazing, just off the beach we saw turtles, parrotfish, pipefish, lionfish, rays and a stonefish. The food in the resort is excellent and reasonably priced. There is a good variety of both local and Mediterranean cuisine, however as the wine is imported it can seem a little expensive. We must recommend the Bamboo CafÃ© next door on the beach for lunch, lovely fresh food served by Mila and her very cute daughter. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. Obviously well trained and very attentive (but not overpowering). The pool boys were very amusing always smiling and happy to chat.Some other visitors have commented on the hawkers. They can get a little much at times, but we found that if you say no to them they do leave you alone, after all how many tee-shirts / sarongs does anyone need? The beach massage ladies give a good massage â good value and definitely recommended. Happy hour gin and tonicâs became the order of the day â mixed by bar staff who donât drink themselves so the measures are very generous - have too many and you might have to stumble back to your room!!!Overall a wonderful place to stay. We would definitely return and have recommended it to our friends."

","Couldn't fault the Hotel","Wasn't too sure what to expect when we arrived, however we were totally surprised on arrival. The hotel is quite new and the layout, facilities and restaurant far exceeded our expectations. We stayed in an ocean view suite on the top floor and normally I am quite critical but we just couldn't fault this hotel. Our only criticism is that the room was a bit light as large overhead window expanse let light in very early but not a major problem. Highly recommend!Make sure you do a day trip to Gillie T although I think 1 day is enough unless you are a keen diver. The accommodation there looked a bit basic."

We really did love the place.The only slight down side was the sea was quite rough and with the coral reef it was quite hard to get out to snorkel. But I think this could have been the time if year we visited. Plus the infinity pools made up for it."

","3 pools, surf beach, out from town but excellent service","We stayed here instead of sleeping over at the Gilis. If you are anything like me you'd appreciate the comfort but could do a daytrip to these islands. The hotel is not in town so you would need to take taxis if you want to dine out. The rooms are a good size, we overlooked the garden and had an outside shower. The 3 infinity edge pools overlook the beach where surfers and ambulant vendors are actively offering you pearls, massages or sarongs wraps. One of their pools is for adults only and its the closest to the bar, conveniently. We arranged a tour guide through the hotel to take us to the Gilis and it was great, it was a private tour where he lead us snorkling and took a video of us and the trip. Fantastic. He picked us up and dropped us off right next to the hotel, the sea was very choppy on the way back which was very adventurous.The hotel has happy hour from 5pm to 7 pm at buy one get one free try their margaritas. the food was a bit of hit and miss and more expensive than Bali but the service is amazing. They dont have daily activities but their spa seemes very nice including daily yoga classes. Overall a great experience, very relaxing not recomended for swimming in the sea tho and no white sand like south lombok."

","Relaxing and beautiful!","We had a great stay at Qunci Villas. The room and service were both fantastic. We traveled as a group of three friends, and even though most of the other guests seemed to be couples we never felt out of place. The extra bed they moved into the room for us was very comfortable and was a real bed, not a roll-away or fold up bed. The beach and pools are fantastic, outdoor shower was great, and the food and drinks were quite good as well. Definitely have breakfast delivered to your room--there is no extra charge, they arrive promptly at the time you request, and it's super relaxing to sit outside on your patio. The staff was great and even offered to have their IT person take a look at my computer when I was having trouble. All in all, a great stay--highly recommended."

","Short trip to lombok!!","As Part of our trip to indonesia (mainly Bali), we took a flight to lombok wich took us about 30 minutes. there we spent a few amazing days at the beautiful beach just next to our boutique hotel qunci villas. the staff is very very friendly and service is perfect. we had a beachfront beachhouse topfloor wich you really should try to get. the view is just awsome. the pool is than only a few footsteps away and is very nicely made. good for swimming as well as to just take a cool jump after sunbathing :-)there are two restaurants in the hotel, one with mostly seafood and one more like italien kitchen. we tried out both and the food is excellent. we never tried to find another place instead - it was just delicious, breakfast, lunch and dinner.you can take boat trips to get to gili islands but we didnt do that because our short stay. instead we did a day trip around the island wich was very interesting. at the end of that trip we ended up at the most beautifull beach i have ever seen. unfortunately i dont know the name and the battery of my camera was gone 5 minutes before arriving there :(wellness and spa is also available."

","Casual Chic yet personalised...","If you want a casual chic hotel, this is it! Had the Canadian (pancake breakfast) 4 days in a row, was simply addicted to it. (I've even refused to have the healthy breakfast which was provided with the yoga class and told them to swap it for the Canadian!!) The Lombok chicken wrap was simply divine while basking by the pool side and the range of cocktail was fantastic! (but try to stick to the lemongrass cocktail that was by far the most pleasant on the adventurous side) oh and look for Suhandi!(waiter) He's one waiter with alot of initiative and provides the best service there and is very amusing as well! He suggested we sat outside for sunset at 5.30pm and we were not disappointed! Even got a good spot for us. Our room attendant was very creative and cute, he made a dog out of a towel and even used my spectacle as a prop, placing it infront of my stuffed toy rabbit! My husband and i were so tickled by it and I was most tempted to take the towel home!! Check out the pic! Masseuse was good but the room was a tad bit too hot & stuffy, im probably used to those outdoor airy massage / chi chi airconditioned types. Overall definitely a place we would come back to, feels like home!"

","Lombok Gem !! if you ever come to Lombok stay here !!!","This is one of the best (if not the best) of all the hotels and resorts I have ever visited !!! All reviews here are right and based on them we picked that place. It is a bit pricy but it is really worth every single dollar or rupiah we spent here. LocationAbsulute perfect location right on the beach. We picked partial ocean view bungalow which had two rooms, one on the ground floor and second on the first one. We had the one upstaris. It is much better, more peacful and great views. Nobody was wondering around. It is located in Mangsit beach 2-3 kilometeres from Senggigi but the taxi costs just 2 USD so this not the issue at all and Mangsit beach is much more better. Rooms/hotelDesign is very indonesian style however very nicely decorated, lighten during the night. Room quality is very high, super standard Bathroom is so nice I could be there all the time :) Please look at the photos. I think we had room no 41. RestaurantBreakfast was super good, very nicely prepared dished, tasteful. Fruits were decorated, nicely cut. Awesome. I have never seen something like that. All that by the ocean. We ate breakfast and once or twice dinner. We usually eat in the local restaurants and the prices in Qunci are high. There is a beach bar located on the right sight of the hotel right on the beach. This is just a simple kitchen on the beach, we ate there couple of times, good and cheap. There is also a nice restaurant with good food in Senggigi, forgot the name but it's just after you pass Sheraton, then Handycraft village and then you have this restaurant. Blue bird taxi to the airport is around 150.000 IDR so it's ok but it's about 1 hour drive. If you stay in the hotel for some nights (we stayed 7) we asked for a complimentary airport pick up and we got it. They don't have this as a normal service but worth asking. I would definately come back here again and if anybody ask me for recommendation in Lombok this will be the one to give."

","Beachfront Charm","Beautiful seaside resort. Very good restaurants. Lovely breakfast on privite vernanda if desired. Best to select villa closer to sea since, otherwise, there is some street noise. While it is tranquil, it is not that quiet. You are getting up early with the first call to prayer and a variety of animals starting their day. Rooms are not soundproof. You can get a TV (satellite cable) if you ask for it-it is not in room or mentioned if you don't ask. Decent wi-fi in room."

","Wonderful stay at Ocean Facing room at Qunci","I love the gorgeous setting of the hotel, on Mangsit Beach facing the Indian Ocean. We had the sea-facing room (#27) and it has a fabulous view of the infinity swimming pool and the sea. Love the outdoor shower too. The staff were all attentive, friendly and quite informative. The hotel was clean and I felt comfortable walking all over the hotel in my bare feet. The hotel allows 3 local women to offer beach side massage services in a beach front cabana. This was nice and supports the local small businesses. Romantic dinner on the beach at sunset was a nice touch. No need to spring for any special arrangement. Just reserve a beach side table for ala carte dinner.The hotel had problems with its water pipes on the day we checked in, resulting in all rooms not having water for 2 hours. As my husband was half way through his shower, the hotel sent a staff with a bucket of water to our room within 10 minutes of our call. Breakfast selection was a bit limited (we stayed for 5 nights). While tasty and nicely plated, I did get tired of the breakfast which comprised mainly eggs and turkey ham in various permutations after a few days. We chose to eat at the few sea facing al fresco tables for breakfast. So the wonderful view compensates for the food selection. I must compliment the hotel on its cleanliness - it was the only place in Lombok we ate at where we were not bothered by flies."

","Exactly what this family was looking for","What a lovely find. We traveled to Lombok in October with our two-year-old son, and were hoping for a place with sand, swimming, and relaxation. Qunci exceeded our expectations. For the price, I think it's a fabulous value--truly one of the loveliest hotels we've enjoyed. As we have a toddler, we opted for a garden terrace room based on other reviews. They were spot on. We had a place near the entrance with plenty of outdoor space for our boy to wander and not bother other guests. Qunci is not a child-centered hotel, and as we're still denying that we're family travelers, we enjoyed that. However, I would caution folks with noisy gaggles of kids from staying here. It's serene, it's beautiful, and it's designed for folks that want quiet and calm. If we had to state a complaint it would be that every single meal--without exception--was either incorrect or lost or delayed. There was always a meal issue. Since we were on holiday, we didn't mind, and the staff was EXCEEDINGLY gracious and kind and overly apologetic. Every problem was solved and everything served was delicious, though on any given day the same thing ordered could be prepared entirely differently. That didn't faze us, and we will absolutely be returning. Qunci is a gem with friendly and helpful staff---many thanks to such a lovely hotel!"

","Paradise found!","We stayed at the exclusive Qunci Villas for 4 days. The first impression was the way we were greeted by the staff. A beautiful smile, a rolled cold towel and a refreshing welcome drink. As we were escorted to our Garden View villa we noticed how gorgeous and well kept the landscaping is. Our one bedroom villa was well appointed with all the amenities to make your stay comfortable. We certainly enjoyed the outdoors shower concept. The staff is extremely professional, courteous and friendly. The'll do anything for you with a warm smile.The hotel has 3 Infinity Pools and a lovely beach that are as peaceful as the views you have of Bali across the Lombok Strait. The sunsets are magnificent. Happy Hour is offered every day from 5-7pm (2 for 1) and delicious tapas are served at very affordable prices. Their cuisine at any of the restaurants or even at a table by the sea is exquisite. Breakfast choices in the morning are vast and healthy. There is attention to detail everywhere...from the way the pool towels are rolled in and decorated with a flower every morning at every chaise lounge, to the food presentation, to the way your room is turned down every evening.The staff is young, hardworking and eager to provide quality service. We are glad to see that the Hotel Management is giving the younger generation a way to build a career. Hats off to them!We'll definitely come back and recommend Qunci Villas to anyone looking for a romantic and relaxing ambiance."

We took the special honeymoon dinner and boy were we pleasantly surprised! The beautiful and romantic dinner setting by the sea took our breath away.

","BREATHAKING","We stayed for 5 days a few weeks ago for my best friedns wedding and it was perfect.The rooms were fantasic, massive outdoor showers with part outdoor bathroom, nice day beds out the front, the actual bed was a deram to sleep in and the pillows......i could float away in them.We had a partial ocean view room, and well it had great ocean views, even some of the garden views were of the ocean and pool area. As we where there for a wedding, a few poeople said they didnt get much hot water in the shower, but we were lucky and was always steaming. Its that hot over on Lombok you dont really need a hot shower anyway. The gardens are so well looked after and they even use a nonmotrised lawn mower...loved it :)The food was pretty cheap aroud $5-8 for lunch and $10-15 for dinner and happy hour at the Tapas bar was great.The staff at Qunci are fantastic, working in hospitality myself I was impressed with the great team they have. Nothing ever a hassel, and they really went above and beyond for entire stay.Its worth hiring some snorkel equipment off the guys down on the beach ($5 for the day) as the reef stright out in front of the resort was great. Heaps of marine life and great colours.Would highly recommend this place to everyone, last year we stayed at the Sheraton which is just down the road from Qunci. It was nice, but now Ive been to Qunci I wouldnt go back to the Sheraton...its my new heaven!!!"

","A lost gem..","We stayed for 7 nights in the Qunci Villas as part of our honeymoon. I stayed in this hotel back in 2009. For me the place lost its 'hidden gem' status since I stayed here the last time, due to its increased size (and a bunch of people more now staying at this place).The hotel is still beautifully designed, the rooms are comfortable and bear a minimalistic art design, the gardens are well kept, and the infinity pool is just stunning. It is located just next to a the beach with this lovely volcano sands. Swimming can be rough if the waves get high but the sea is great. A pain are the sellers on the beach. They keep on shouting over the pool to sell their stuff which is really annoying. Staff is friendly, helpful, and always smiling, though sometimes bit lost in transition (e.g when help is needed for the umbrella, or towels are missing). I think though its part of the local mentality as we saw this also in the Sheraton the week before? The breakfast is a la card, becomes boring though after a while. Side wishes are difficult to get executed (as the staff sometimes just doesn't get it). The food quality though is very good. Prices are more or less reasonable, nevertheless we went pretty often to Senggigi for lunch / dinner (as its cheaper, even with the transport forth & back). Next to the hotel is also a nice little 'Restaurant' where you can grab some bites for lunch. We tried it once and its ok.We tried the massage and Pedicure, first one is ok but could definitely be better (move them out of the standard massage world into a real massage), last one was good.Unfortunately, during our stay, a pair of pants and the MP3 player got stolen out of the room. The staff and management reacted pretty quickly and professional. The police was called the day after and a protocol written. Though something like a theft should not happen in a place like the Qunci Villas but at least Management reacted quickly. Still I don't understand, why the hotel didn't even offer anything for compensation, not even a drink. I traveled a lot in my life, and things got stolen in various countries, but this never happened to me before. To conclude, its a beautiful hotel with a good location and nice pool, but we felt its now all about profit rather than customer satisfaction which was the reason for me to return. We will not return for sure."

It is just wonderful - amazing location right on the beach - beautiful rooms & the friendliest most helpful staff we have found anywhere - would recommend Qunci in a flash....... Breakfast can be delivered to your room - you can take it in the restaurant OR you can have it served right next to the beach overlooking the sea. The meal & dribk charges are very reasonable & can be booked straight to your room. he food is good although the menu is a little limited - itis good quality - for a change just a few kms up the road is Sengiggi where you can find plenty of food options - also worth a trip in Mataram (The capital) for a look - we went to the big shopping centre in Mataram & it was excellent shopping."

","Beautiful, Relaxing Hotel and Great Value for the Money","Seven of us stayed at the Qunci Villas as part of a family trip for my parents' 50th anniversary. The beach and ocean views are fantastic. The grounds are beautifully designed and impeccably kept. I stayed in a 2 bedroom villa with a beautiful private plunge pool. The room was spacious with simple furniture and beautiful artwork. One thing to note that the bathroom is partially 'outside'. It is covered, but the shower (which is also covered) is open to the outside at all times. It could also use a bit more light. The service is excellent and there is a great attention to detail. For example the towels are rolled on the beach chairs each morning and a hibiscus flower is placed at the end. Breakfast came with the room. There are a lot of choices and the food was very good for the most part. Lots of homemade juices to try. All the tables overlook the ocean and make for a fabulous way to start the day. The restaurants on the whole are pretty good. I thought lunch was better than dinner. Drinks during happy hour are 2 for 1. A great way to watch the sun go down. The spa was excellent! I had a series of treatments over 2 hours (including a soak in a gorgeous outdoor stone tub with fresh flowers and a cup of ginger tea) for about $50US! I highly recommend a side trip to Lombok (which is a fascinating island) to stay at the Qunci Villas if you are visiting Bali. One additional recommendation is to take the fast boat (about 2.5 hours) vs. flying from Bali. We did both and the boat is actually faster b/c of where the new airport is located on Lombok."

","Gorgeous villas, great value for money","We stayed at Qunci Villas for 2 nights. It was the perfect place to chill out, and enjoy a stress-free beach vacation.The food served at the restaurants were very good quality and relatively inexpensive. They had ample pool and beach access as well as massage facilities. The only 2 areas of improvement I would like to recommend are:1) provide bigger bottles of water in the room, or offer 1 litre bottles for sale. The hotel only had small complimentary bottles in the room, and 500ml bottles in the mini bar and restaurants. We were not keen to go out of the hotel, so we did not have access to buying bigger bottles from the store. 2) more flexibility with check out time. We requested for a late check out which the staff refused to consider. We would've understood if it was a case of a guest arriving early. However in this case, we were told that a guest from another room wanted to move into ours so we had to check out by 12pm and no later. We asked what the hurry was if they were already in another room, but the staff would not provide us a response except that we need to leave the room by 12pm.We checked out at 12pm as requested, but that the staff's handling of the situation affected our impression of their overall service and our experience.

","A wonderful place to relax for a few days","We spent a single night here on an island hopping trip and were very impressed with pretty much everything we experienced. The staff were very friendly and helpful from the moment we arrived. We ate the buffet breakfast which was included and loved the wide choice of options available and constant coffee refills. We went out for dinner so didn't get to experience the restaurant's dinner menu.The resort is beautifully laid out and right on a clean, quiet beach. The pools are fantastic and there is plenty of room for everyone to get a place to lounge around. The quality of the furnishings and buildings is excellent and easily of five star quality.We tried the spa and again were both extremely impressed with the professionalism and quality of the massages.We highly recommend Qunci Villas to anyone visiting Lombok and wanting an oasis to realx in."

","Loved Qunci!","My husband and I stayed at Qunci Villas for 3 nights, with a night in between to hike Mount Rinjani. We couldn't fault the place! Stunning location right on Mangsit beach, with 3 infinity pools and beautiful gardens. What a place to have a drink and a swin to watch the sunset!! The villas are located about a 5-10 minute drive into central Senggigi, but it's only about $1-2 in a cab. The staff are more than happy to call a cab for you so you don't have to wait. We only went into Senggigi once, we didn't feel the need to go back there as everything we needed was at Qunci.The Villas were lovely - our first stay we had an upstairs villa which had a more private balcony, but the bathroom was much smaller. The second time we had a downstairs villa with a slight different layout and an huge outdoor bathroom. I much preferred this villa, even though the outdoor area wasn't so private. You can't really beat having a long, hot shower under the stars! Especially after such a long hike up the volcano. We did have an early start one morning on the way to the hike, and Qunci were more than happy to store our bags, and also provided us with a breakfast box to take with us (juice, fruit, crossaints, bread, jams, etc). The food we found at Qunci was delicious so we did eat at the resort often. Breakfast was fantastic - a choice of about 8 menu items depending on what you feel like (all included in the price). Lunch had a huge menu, and the sunset cocktails at happy hour were really good - well worth the 2 for 1 offer. They also offer bar snacks during this time to tie you over until dinner time (quite well priced, at around $2-5 per serving). They set up tables by candlelight for dinner on the beach - I loved this!! Less food choices for dinner and slightly more expensive, but so worth it. The service is a little slow at times, but the location is so beautiful that it's hard to complain about anything.There is a small local restaurant right on the beach next door which we also ate at. The locals that run the place were super friendly and the Indonesian food was very cheap and delicious. Very cheap Bintangs there also! One night we sat around with the locals playing guitar, drinking Bintang and singing and laughing which was so much fun. I have very fond memories of Qunci and can't wait to go back. We loved it!"

","Perfect for destination wedding !","After spending a week in Senggigi in 2011 my fiancee and i were set on having a destination wedding in lombok, its quieter pace then Bali and amazing coastline were perfect to us. After a couple of months looking into resorts and doing research we couldnt go past the Qunci villas.We spent just over 12 months of emailing backward and forwards with the Qunci Villas to see our wedding Come together on the day the way it did was amazing. I learnt to go with the flow and that things are done in Lombok time- there isn't a rush, so some emails may take a week to get a reply but really that isn't a issue. We had chosen a destination wedding but still wanted it to be classy and elegant- the Qunci didn't fail, the venue, service, food and facilities were all 5 star. With 3 pools to choose from even a adults only pool within the resort and villas with private pools everyone was catered for.The staff were always very helpful. Even with one bouquet short as we were about to leave for ceremony , within minutes they had whipped one together. All of our guest spoke very highly of there time at Qunci and all remarked at how reasonably priced everything was. The Qunci has rooms and villas within everyone's price range even the garden view rooms were huge and beautiful! And the outdoor bathrooms were a hit with everyone! We would not hesitate recommending anyone to go to the qunci at all for a holiday or to have a wedding there. Just trust there team, they are great at what they do! It can be hard communicating your whole wedding via email but worth every bit of it.We enjoyed our week at the Qunci and we will be back next year!"

","Great stay except for one issue","We visited Lombok for 5 days, and stayed at Qunci villas for 2 nights. This is our second time in Lombok, and one of the factors that prompted us to return was actually how great Qunci villas was the first time we were here. However this time round upon arrival, we were told that the room was not ready yet, although it was already 2pm. We thought it was no big deal, so we headed to the restaurant to grab a bite and enjoy the view. But we were only able to check in at 4pm eventually. We also made sure to inform the staff upon check in that we required a later checkout on the last day, as we had an evening (7+pm) flight to catch. The reply was to check with them one day before as they were not sure about availability. We called to enquire on the last evening of the stay but could not get an affirmative reply. On the last day after breakfast, we enquired again only to be informed that all the rooms were full and we had to check out at 12pm. I am rather disappointed at their lack of organisation. To be fair, everything else was good- the food, the view, the pool. I just wish the management could have better handled this issue. We will certainly not be staying here the next time we have an evening flight back."

","Be Care of the Sun","The Qunci Villas were a wonderful boutique hotel on Lombok. The design of the hotel was beyond belief. The food and service was wonderful. The rooms were spacious and for the most part well designed. The hoyel had one feature which I found to be design over function. The bathrooms were in a separate area through a separate door. The bathroom was only partially enclosed (out-doors) making the bathroom hot and humid. One could get sunburn using the sink or toilet."

","Lovely stay","Qunci is located just slightly north of Senggigi in the Mangsit area, just over 5 minute drive from Senggigi. We had a nice 3 night stay at Qunci in one of their partial ocean view rooms. The room was lovely with outdoor bathroom and outside seating area. Beds were very comfy and the rooms stylish. Only things missing where a general info book on Qunci, the facilities and restaurants and we would have liked tea and coffee in the room. Breakfast was nice with a variety of different egg choices, all of which come with tea, coffee and juice and a plate of fresh fruit. The swimming pools and loungers were all very nice, perfect place to watch the sunset too. Food and drinks we found to be fairly expensive relative to general prices in Senggigi so we went out to dinner each night. Most of the restaurants provide free transport so ask the hotel to call them if you know where you want to dine. No one seemed to make use if the beach. Maybe because of the hawkers constantly hanging around, even calling you from the beach when your lying by the pool. The sea is pretty rocky on this stretch so we weren't able to swim. We would definitely recommend this hotel."

","Heaven on Earth !","My wife and I stayed at Qunci villas for 6 nights as part of our honeymoon and from the moment we arrived we knew we had made the right decision . The staff are absolutely fantastic , very friendly and accommodating and brilliant service . The food was wonderful also but the best part was the setting . Qunci villas obviously put a great deal of effort into keeping the grounds so well manicured and it shows . Qunci villas is 5* at the price of 4* .

","AWESOME","stayed here 3 nights late september for a superbly awesome weekend. qunci offers a great 5star experience for a really great deal. ill be trying my best to itemize this review, so here goes.the check-in - a breeze. i couldn't ask for more, after a stressful trip to denpasar airport from our hotel in legian, we almost didn't make our flight to lombok. but luckily we got in, anyway, arriving at qunci front desk, i just showed my reservation confirmation then after less than a minute, i'm already singing my guest card and have a cold towel and a welcome drink in hand while walking to your room.the surroundings - stress relief. all cares went away. 3 infinity pools overlooking the ocean with the sunset bidding an end to your day while having a strawberry martini in hand. its just relaxing.the room - nicely appointed, and very spacious. we had a 2nd floor partial ocean view and you couldn't care less. we still had a great view out of our balcony and we really enjoyed using the balcony. for the room, there were 3 of us so we had an extra bed and it was still spacious for us to move about.the staff - well mannered and courteous. always smiling and making sure you have every thing you'd need. they'd even go the extra mile of remembering your name.the food - cheap and great. we first thought that we were going to break our bank eating at this hotel. but no, we were surprised to see the pricing. its really cheap, and good. with that, we didn't even had any meal outside of qunci except for the day we went to the gilis. but probably if we were staying longer, we would have to go out as qunci has a relatively small menu for both its restaurants. nevertheless, for 4 days maybe even 5, you wouldn't run out of choices.the location - located about 15k IDR from senggigi (taxi fare) so its not that far. you get a quite clean beach with a great break for surfers. some reviews said about the Mosques being too noisy in the morning, and yes i can hear it, but its not that noisy that it should bother you. our room was on the perimeter already of the hotel grounds and no noise bothered us during our stay.summary - thanks qunci for a great experience, we sure would be coming back to your hotel. keep it up and cheers. happy traveling to all (3 travelers aged mid 20's)"

","Lazy days in Lombok....","We recently had the pleasure of spending 5 nights at Qunci. We spent the first 3 nights in Qumbang Villa, which is located up on the hill away from the rest of the resort. It was truly amazing, with our own infinity edge pool leading off the deck, looking out over the Lombok Straits. Upstairs, the bedroom was expansive with a huge comfortable bed, with another deck and open air style bathroom. We were woken each morning at around 5.00am to the prayers from a nearby Mosque, which we found quite mystical and certainly reminded us that we were not at home. Along with the boisterous hollers from the nearby roosters and goats, it really made the stay up on the hill unique, knowing that whilst we stayed in luxury, local life continued on around us. We spent the remaining two nights in a pool villa named Qusemsem, meaning âFalling in loveâ, and this villa was equally as impressive. The local artwork and attention to detail is what makes this place special. Walking through the grounds, you are amazed at the precision and thought that went into the design, from the positioning of the rooms and day spa, to the simplistic but impressive landscaping leading to the beach.We generally spent half our time in the villa, getting probably too much sun, and then would meander down to one of the three beach front wet edge pools, where we would enjoy the happy hour (two hours actually), sampling the variety of cocktails on offer and taking in the view. The west coast of Lombok has the most amazing sunsetâs, looking across the waters to the peak of Mt Agung in Bali, and gave us a good opportunity to hone in our photographic skills, still much improvement needed there.Breakfast each morning was a highlight for us, sitting at one of the beachfront settings, eating great food and watching the waves roll in. My husband would generally go out for a swim in the ocean once we ordered, and join me once the food arrived, just in time to sample a smorgasbord of tasty treats.We ate in all of the restaurants, and apart from being very reasonably priced, the food was superb, with plenty of choices, and wonderfully fresh seafood. We particularly enjoyed the Indonesian style whole cooked fish, but could not fault any of the other offerings, which covered local delicacies to standard western fare. If you are a fan of spice, you will need to ask for extra chilies, as the heat is toned down a fair bit, but be careful as my over-enthusiastic partner found out.Apart from the calming, relaxing nature of this place, it is the staff that makes it so special. From the moment you check in, you are greeted with a warm smile, and personal service that a lot of places are lacking these days. Each afternoon, we would spent the time chatting with Gatot and Usman, who not only provided exceptional service, but also made us laugh, sharing stories from their home whilst taking an interest in life in Australia. The friendliness extended to everyone we spoke with, from the drivers, cleaning staff, to the waiters, masseuses, reception staff and management. The local hawkers, once they know your face, donât bother you, and usually a simple ânoâ would suffice. I was happy to inspect their goods, and bought a couple of really nice, inexpensive gifts for family back home. My husband, who had an injured arm, even somehow convinced me that I should have a go at surfing, and spent a couple hours riding gentle waves under the watchful tuition of Jimmy, a local guy who sported a great dreadlocks and a cheeky grin. I actually had a great morning, but safe to say, Steph Gilmore has nothing to fear.Probably the only downside to our stay, and for us it was more disappointing than anything else, was the arrival of a group for a wedding. On our final night, which coincided with a Henâs night, things got a little rowdy, and you could feel the dynamics of the place change. Guests were obviously getting agitated, and at one point there was an influx of people congregating at the far southern end of the resort, away from the party. As things proceeded, and donât get me wrong, I have nothing against people having a good time, and they seemed like a good bunch of people, one of the revelers decided to take part in a backflip competition. The grassed area in front of the Quali restaurant had been set up for a traditional Indonesian banquet, with other guests, not associated with this group, sitting close by when the acrobatic Aussie was into about his 5th or 6th flip. Unluckily for him, and although this may have been impressive in another arena, he misjudged the table placement, and crashed through the setting, completely destroying everything. A number of guests, who were obviously not only horrified, but visibly shaken, quickly moved away. Nevertheless, everything seemed to settle down to a normal level after this event, most likely with the realization that eviction from the resort was a real possibility. Needless to say, the embarrassed tumbler, obviously hiding injury, quickly decamped from the scene.We were approached by the manager later that night, who apologized to us, and no doubt many other guests, and it was quite clear that this was not the type of image that Qunci was about. We spoke with another couple from Austria who checked in the same day as us. As they said, apart from some reckless, disrespectful behavior, you could not fault this place. They suggested that if another gymnastic performance were held the next day, peace would once again be restored.In our case, Qunci is one of those magical places that you find after searching for many years. We loved every moment of it, and although no trip can ever be perfect, this was as close as it gets. We have already booked our return visit next year, and I am already counting down the sleeps."

","Beautiful hotel!","We recently had an amazing 4 nights at qunci villa. We were traveling in a group of friends and after 1 day all the staff knew our room numbers off by heart! There was a good variety of food in the restaurants at reasonable prices. The garden view rooms are lovely and a lot more private than the ocean view rooms. Try to make sure you get a downstairs room as they have outdoor bathrooms. My only suggestion would be to put information packs in the rooms which explain about the different restaurants etc."

","Surprisingly perfect!","We typically would not choose a hotel like Qunci but as new parents it was an ideal place to stay. Pre 7 month old baby we would go for a small, unique establishment with a more local feel. However, this well managed and equipped, highly professional hotel made for a perfect holiday. The staff and service were superb, always accommodating our requests (big and small) rapidly and with a smile. The rooms are modern, well designed, and tastefully decorated with all your basic needs. They did a great job constructing rooms that limit noise transfer also, given our neighbors never heard our baby crying. Everything was spotless and all the details taken care of. It seemed like their army of staff were always planting, painting, sweeping and maintaining the grounds and rooms vigilantly.With a little one we find ourselves stuck at the hotel more than we prefer at mealtimes (which tend to coincide with bedtimes) so it was especially nice that Qunci has two restaurant menus to choose from and provides room service. Food was always very good and arrived quickly and hot. In fact, the night we managed to eat in town at a recommended restaurant we wished we hadn't because the hotel food was much better! Two for one drinks daily from 5-7pm is a nice bonus!The location is about a 15 minute taxi ride to the main area of Senggi. It is on a nearly private bay. The beach is very clean and the water crystal clear with visibility from your neck to toes (and beyond if you snorkel). The hotel also boasts 3 infinity pools and plenty of top of the line lounge chairs and umbrellas to complete the experience. It is a 5 star feel for a 3 star price.I would highly recommend this hotel as a destination holiday for families and romantic couples. Since we live in Jakarta we will certainly return."

","Stunning Location","After staying on Bali for the first few nights of our honeymoon we transferred over to Lombok for part two. We opted to take the speedboat transfer as we felt we'd spent enough time on aeroplanes getting from London to Bali. Be warned - the boat is NOT for the faint hearted!! Although we thoroughly enjoyed the experience, some people were quite ill and I certainly had my share of nervous moments. The sea can get very rough between the two islands. We were met at the harbour and driven the 15-20 minutes to Qunci. The drive in itself is pretty awesome - Lombok is truly beautiful and so far unspoilt by tourism. Check in at Qunci was very efficient and we were greeted with refreshing cold drinks. Nobody batted an eyelid at our drenched clothes from the boat trip, perhaps they're used to it?!Our pool villa wasn't ready (a slight inconvenience as we were desperate to change out of our wet clothes), so we were taken to the main pool area and told someone would find us in a little while. The seafront location of this hotel is out of this world! Laying on a sunbed, drinking a cold Bintang and looking out across the ocean made waiting for our villa a very pleasant experience!We sadly had to go looking for someone to find out if the villa was ready and were eventually led to it (Qembang, next to reception). It was beautiful! Spotlessly clean and with a little Happy Honeymoon cake waiting for us. My only criticism regarding the villa was the open entrance. Although our pool and garden were discreetly hidden by trees and plants the entrance was open to anyone. The addition of some sort of door with a bell would have made it perfect for us.The staff were all very discreet but we never knew anyone was arriving until they were in our garden. We had breakfast delivered to our room each monring (no extra charge for this) and it was always on time, very fresh and tasty. We ate in one of the three restaurants most nights. As I don't like fish there wasn't a great deal of choice for me, but my husband tried just about everything and loved it all. We had a great dinner on the beach one night which was very romantic. Service was always fantastic. Most of the staff are very young (early 20's) and clearly determined to deliver to the best of their abilities. Their English isn't always great, but they are desperate to learn and a credit to the management. Anyone staying at Qunci MUST go along to the pool area for Happy Hour at least once during their stay. There is a wide choice of cocktails (buy one, get one free). My husband particularly liked the Singapore Sling, I enjoyed the various flavoured Vodka Martinis. What makes happy hour such a must is the amazing sunsets every evening. I must have taken at least 100 photos of sunsets over the five nights we stayed there! The spa is lovely. We both had treatments and these were very reasonably priced. Try the Volcanic Mud wrap. The coconut bath and ginger tea afterwards were wonderful! Some people have criticised the hawkers on the beach. Yes there are quite a few of them and they are pretty desperate to sell their goods. However, we found them all to be very friendly and had no trouble once we had made it clear we weren't interested in buying. Having said that, at the end of our stay we did buy some fantastic wooden masks and t-shirts. We were pleased to have contributed to their income, life cant be very easy for these lovely people. We spent an evening in the local village - Sengiggi. Well worth a visit, not far away and very cheap in a taxi. We had a lovely dinner in Squares restaurant, followed by drinks at the Happy Cafe. We absolutely loved our long, lazy, stressfree days at Qunci and desperately hope to go back one day."

","Wonderful","Thanks to his magnificient swimm pool with view over the sea, thanks to his big quiet rooms (very clean with a open shower)and a private balcony, thanks to the courtesy of the staff in this place you'll feel like in paradise. The breakfast you can get it in two different restaurants or directly on the garden. Senggiggi is just 5 min taxi away of the resort and if you need to go to the speed boat harbour, it'll take around 20 min.taxi. Of course not all is just perfect if you don't like to be disturbed from local sellers you must stay a little more near of the pool than to the sea...every days the locals search to sell to you some pareo or t-shirts or others things....but is enough to say no thanks and they go!"

","Stunning!!","What can I say that has not already been said about this hotel....not much!We arranged a car to pick us up at the airport as our flight got in late and it was there waiting for us and we were quickly on our way. Check in was seamless and our pre ordered food was in the room for us 10 minutes after we arrived.The room (28) was breath taking- the sound of the sea lapping the shores was so relaxing and the cleaning was of a very high standard.The outside shower was excellent - not sign of mosquitoes at all. The setting was well maintained and very beautiful. The pool and beach were perfect and we found the beach hawkers to be always pleasant and not at all pushy. In fact we had a good laugh with them during our 6 night stay and treated them with the respect that they deserve. We did buy some fruit and a few keep sakes but never did we get surrounded by them. Every evening greeting them goodbye and telling them we would see them again in the morning.The breakfast was always tasty and the choice was very good - served every single time with and smile and genuine happy chatter. The staff in my opinion are well trained and we never had a single problem with our food or drink order - we ate 3 times in the restaurant on an evening, which was delicious, hot and served with a smile. We even got a packed breakfast on our last day as we were leaving before breakfast service began - nice touch!The cocktails were to die for and I am not usually fond of ""Happy Hour"" cocktails but the Orange and Cinnamon was excellent.The car back to the airport was confirmed about 4 times with us, which was not a problem and the driver was careful and on time, even though we left early in the morning.What can I say that would help improve this hotel? That's a hard question and the only thing our room lacked was some information on the restaurants and menu details. We did get the run through on arrival by the reception, however, late at night, you just want to get to your room, so we maybe did not pay too much attention.We have travelled a lot and stayed in Taj's, Shangri La's and Mandarin Orientals and know a good hotel when we see it. A huge big well done to the owners of this hotel - you are up there with the world class hotels and I would recommend you to anyone who is looking to travel to Lombok without hesitation!!"

","Awesome place...yet bit inconsistent","This was my second time staying at Qunci Villa. I opted for a longer stay of 5 days. The place had expanded, the garden was immaculate, the spa was sublime, and the room was all you can think of after a long day under the sun. The staff, although very friendly and trying hard to address your request, were bit inconsistent. Maybe it's overwhelming servicing customers with an all year long 90% occupancy rate, yet they served my breakfast orders wrong 3 days in a row, and they were the same order. I wrote it down, even spoke to the staff myself, but wrong again. The food was overall good, some were very good, some were overcooked, made me wonder if they alternate the cook every few days. The back office staff was the best, they were the ones I would salute to. All in all, the location of the hotel is superb, beachfront stretched long enough for your eyes to indulge. I will return to Qunci Villa."

","gorgeous, relaxing, easy going, family capable hotel","The serenity of Qunci makes it one of the most relaxing holidays you can imaging. Now we three sets of villas across the same stretch of beach the property offers even more space within which to unwind. This was my second visit this year and I really wished I had booked in for a longer stay.Atmosphere/Location - beautiful sandy beach, clear blue waters, tranquil setting with plenty of space for all the guests to get a sun bed and do precisely nothing. The gardens are spacious with loads of space for kids, the restaurants are zen like in their comfortable simplicity. Rooms - we chose an upstairs villa with balcony overlooking the ocean. Yup, kick butt. I would always aim for one of these. If its out of budget that's not a problem, loads of space at the pools. They are pretty clean and simple layouts, very functional and the private balcony is big enough for a family of four or five to lounge around. We got a spare bed for our two kids (4 and 5) and it worked out fine.Pools - awesome. three to chose from (one for adults only).Service - great big friendly smiles. The guys are young though so their capability is still in development don't expect the worlds greatest service in terms of knowing intrinsically what you want but do expect honest, humble and generous people working the best to make you happy.Food and Beverage - daily happy hour is killer, just too good for me to avoid. Food ranged from not so great to some really special dishes (I highly recommend the seafood in particular the moon scallops). We attended a wedding and thought that meal was excellent. A big range of lovely dishes.Best - tranquility, locationWorst - food variability if i had to be pickyGo Again - absolutely, planning it already"

","A Slice of Heaven on the Beach","We spent 8 days at Qunci Villas and left totally relaxed, wishing we could stay longer. We will be back!Qunci is about one and a half hours drive from the new Lombok Airport and is located a few kilometers north of Senggigi Â on Mangsit Beach. Â  The property is stylish contemporary design with attention to detail. Its grounds Â are beautiful and have views across the Bali Sea to Bali. The sunsets are truly memorable.Â The rooms are a series of single and double storied Villas scattered around the property. Rooms 1 to 19 are a bit closer together than the rest of the rooms at the property. There are also a number of pool villas.The hotel was almost full when we booked and so we could only get an Ocean Front villa for 4 days and then had to move to a Garden View room for the remainder of our stay. Given the location of the property, its stylish design and great service we felt that the price of the rooms was excellent Â value.Â Both of our rooms were great, but we did enjoy the Ocean Front villa more than the Garden View villa. Â We were spoiled by the Ocean Front room especially being able to watch the magnificent sunsets each evening from our room.Â Our Ocean Front room was on the Â second floor where as the Garden View villa was a ground floor room and you are not afforded as much privacy as the second floor rooms. That being said the garden view room was a lovely room. The Architect and design team have done a wonderful job. Â All the rooms are spacious and have original art work in them including paintings, sculptures and Buddha heads. Â The bathrooms are outdoor, which concerned me originally because of Mosquitos and bugs. However, as the hotel continually treats Â its grounds we did not encounter any problems with Mosquitos.Â The rooms do not have TV's in them but this did not concern us and, I understand, the hotel does have TVs if you do want one for your room.Â Qunci offers free Internet and this could be accessed every where on the property. Â There is a Mosque close to the property and you will hear the call to prayer starting every morning at 5 am. We dozed through that each morning and went back to sleep so it was not a problem.Â The property has two restaurants and a Tapa's bar. The menus differed at each location and gave you a great Â choice of Asian and Western food. Its pricing, given the location of the property and the professional service, was not expensive.We had a few meals at the hotel, which is unusual for us as we generally venture out to eat local. The food was well presented and both dishes arrived at the same time meaning we could eat together.Â All the staff were excellent and spoke good english. They were there to make your stay a pleasant one and were always on hand if you wanted something to eat or drink.Breakfast was included with our room rate and was served at either of the two restaurants, the Tapa's bar or in your room. The menu differed slightly at the Tapas bar to the restaurants but generally included your choice of fresh juice, a fruit platter, a choice of a main course, which was a variation on breakfast dishes from around the world, tea and coffee.Â Every afternoon between 3 and 5 was Happy Hour where you could get 2 for one drinks from the extensive drinks list. Â There Â was more that just the usual tropical cocktails on the list and we enjoyed very well made Negroni's and dry Martinis on more than one occasion.Â During our stay there were 3 themed night dinners at the hotel. A seafood BBQ, an Indonesian food market night and an Indonesian set dinner and a show night. We went to the dinner and show night which was US$25++ well priced considering Â you got a Beef Laska, a choice of fish or chicken and then a rice desert while being able to watch local dancers perform for you.Â The property has 3 separate infinity pools, one of which was an adults only pool. There were plenty loungers around the pool and fresh towels were always available. Â There is a spa at the property which operates from 9 am until 10 pm. We only used the spa once during our stay. Again, its price was relatively inexpensive given the location property and the surroundings in which you are having your Â treatment.Â We were met at the spa by a receptionist and offered a cold towel and an iced lemongrass drink Â while our treatment room was prepared. Â We had a two hour treatment which comprised a Balinese massage, then a choice of a body wrap or a body body scrub. This was followed by a hot bath which contained fresh herbs, such as ginger and galangal, limes and sandal wood. All of this for US$55++ is not a bad price when compared to other spas in top properties.Â In addition to the spa there are beach massage ladies at the beach front of the property. They use one of the hotels cabanas on the beach and only charge IDR100,000. They have been professionally trained and know how to given a good massage. Â We used them Â 4 times during our stay!There are plenty of beach hawkers walking up and down the beach but they do not intrude on your stay. A polite ""no thank you "" sees them move on. Start to engage with them and it is like bees to a honey pot as they gather around trying to sell you their wares. Â It can actually be a bit of fun after you have distressed!Â We love to venture out to eat local and the property not too far from Senggigi Beach where most of the restaurants are located. Â It was a bit too far to walk into town, so we caught taxis which only cost about IDR 12,000 ( about US$1.2) each way. There are also a couple of Warungs outside the property where you could get a basic meal and a beer for 2 people for about IDR150,000 ( about US$15).Â Also across the road was a laundry service where we got a week's laundry done for IDR 75,000. Whist the hotel had its own laundry service it can get a bit expensive having all your laundry Â done by the hotel.Â One thing that we did not like during our stay was that there was a large wedding party group staying for about 6 days. Because of their numbers they took over one of the pool areas each day. Â A group that large does tend to make a lot of noise and that detracted from the peace and quiet guests expect to find at a property such as Qunci.Â Everyone is entitled to holiday in their own particular way but I did not expect to see people dive bombing in the pool, shouting at their young children from the loungers and standing Â in the pool, or walking around the grounds, drinking beer from large glass beer bottles. If your only holiday coincided with a large group party Â then your stay may not have been as relaxing as you may have anticipated. Thankfully, because there are 3 pools at the property we were able to get away from the noise but I do not think the property is suited to large groups who are there to party.Â One other issue is that the hotel only provides you with 2 very small bottles of water free each day. We did not feel that it was enough given that you probably should not drink the tap water Â You can buy water from your Â mini bar or with your meal, however, we simply went across the road to the small shop and bought a couple of Â 1.5 l bottles each day for a fraction of the Â cost. Not really a problem.Â All said and done this is a magnificent property located on the beach where you can watch truly memorable sunsets. Â I do hope it does not become a venue for many large wedding groups as this will detract from the reason many people want to stay at Qunci..Â "

","Delightful resort with professional staff..","Qunci Villas is a delightful resort where you can relax, unwind and, on a clear day, watch the sun set over the neighbouring island of Bali. The grounds and rooms are extremely well kept with a keen attention to detail, which is to be expected for the price you pay to stay here. The food served up at the bar and restaurants was really good which was a pleasant surprise. If you feel like splurging, staying at one of their Villas up on the hill is highly recommended, but the rooms, facilities and service down on the beach level resort is nice enough. Manager Wiwik was very professional in dealing with my one complaint that I had - that my phone was stolen, most likely by a member of staff - including following up with Qunci Villas staff and local police after we had left Lombok. I thought I would mention this here, not to deter people from staying here and feeling safe with their personal possessions, but to highlight the professionalism of management in addressing the matter."

","Disappointed","The descriptor for Qunci Villas is 'your key to an idyllic Lombok'. Well, er, not exactly if one arrives the same day as a rather down market wedding party of some 25 Germans. But more of this later.We stayed at QV two years ago and really enjoyed the experience. Last year we tried Jeeva Klui (just down the road) and also had a great time and would have returned to Jeeva but for the fact that I was quoted a 100% increase in the cost for exactly the same room for the same period. So this year back to QV.As far as we could detrmine the demographics of QV's guests has changed since our last visit. There were more sleeveless T shirts, tatoos, young children and single sex couples, people playing music from radios and ipods but thankfully no English football shirts although this maybe around the corner. No doubt this is a result of the increase in the number of rooms, the marketing strategy and the pricing structure. For most this might be just fine. But not for us. And I'm aware this opinion is a personal opinion but then again this is what Tripadvisor is all about.We arrived on a Monday in August and in drips and drabs the wedding party also arrived - our hearts sank. They were extremely noisy (the more so as the alchohol flowed) with organised games, whistle blowing, swimming pool jousting and a general display of selfish and intrusive behaviour. They would congregate at the end pool at midday and party on. One night the noise was unbelievable at 4.00 am and another at midnight. We complained to the management but they were in a difficult position in that a wedding party has to be extremely lucrative. Other guests might not have complained but we were aware of the discomfort and irritation of quite a few guests. I'm not sure if all of the group stayed at QV as some would disappear but like a bad dream would return. This went on for a week. A week which my wife and I had looked forward to for some R&R for many months.The roomI had an initial problem with booking a specific room but subsequently QV were very very helpful and as others have said the room (upper ocean facing) was great. We were in the new section with a lovely view especially as the sea with breaking waves is lit up at night. The new section looks as though it has always been there and this is a tribute to the architects, designers and management.ServiceThe staff at QV are just brilliant. They are polite to a fault and go out of their way to ensure that guests are happy. When their English was not 100% they again tried very hard to understand requests - I have no problem with staff not being fluent in English as its difficult to learn. All in all wonderful people.FoodOK'ish. Breakfast was interesting as more often than not everything was brought to the table in one shot. Therefore one had a table full of bacon (beef bacon only) & eggs, cereal, croissants etc with the hot stuff getting cold before one could get to it. Another point is that out of all the meals (breakfast & dinner) we only had two meals in which the food was hot due to plates being cold.This ensured that at best the food was warm to start and cold to finish Maybe QV should invest in a plate warmer?The dinner menu had a choice but if one is not into seafood then there was limited choice. What about a 'special' every evening? Overall I have to say we were disappointed with the food. My wife had prawns which were served with carrots, cauliflower, mangetout and brocolli - odd to say the least and maybe tring to hard to be 'trendy'. One evening, to escape the wedding party, we went to Jeeva and thought their menu much more interesting and our meal was hot! Once again I emphasise this is a personal opinion.SurroundsThe gardens are immaculate and are well tended. The trees and flowers in the new section look as though they have been there for years (as some have) and are a credit to the people who look after them. The pools are pristine. The beach is typical 'volcanic' so don't try running into the water as you might well end up with very sore feet. The water is clear and warm - approx 26 degrees. There was one morning out of ten which was OK for surfing with easy waves.Beach peddlarsSome have found them irritating but we found them no problem at all. They always had a smile and if one is not interested in their wares then a polite 'no thank you' is all that is needed. There are a selection of small boats down the beach which can be hired to take one to the Gilli islands.The Mosque chantingAround 4.30 am to 5.00 am is when the chanting starts. Yes, we were woken up most days but because the beds are so comfortable we were soon back to sleep. Not a problem.The airportLombok's new airport has been designed by someone who rented a time machine and went back to the seventies. Arrivals is just as chaotic as it ever was. One line for visas on arrival and another queue to have the visa stamped - madness. Whist waiting in the latter queue I heard not one but two couples ask the visa chap if there was also an exit visa to be bought on departure. They were both told 'no'. This, of course, is 100% incorrect - the exit visas cost about $11 pp so don't forget to have the cash available when you leave Lombok. The entry and exit visas come to about (I think) $36 pp. Then there is the one and half hour drive to QV at an extra $30 per trip. All told from arrival at the airport to a cold beer at QV took two and a half hours. When leaving there were seven checks of our stuff and the immigration/passport desk queue took almost 45 minutes to get through.Beer & laundryA beer at QV costs approx $3.15 which coming from Cape Town is quite expensive so we went to the shop across the road and bought our beers for half the price. As an aside a beer at the Orinetal in Bangkok was $8.50! And don't even think of having wine - the prices are eye wateringly expensive. I understand that because Lombok is Muslim there are horrendous import duties but even so..... Laundry at QV is also not cheap. But the shop accross the road does a good job at a knock down price.We were so looking forward to our annual holiday but this time around QV was a bit of a disappointment. The food was average. And the wedding party along with other noisy guests were intrusive - from loud children to people playing music by the pool whilst the majority were trying to read. Even without the wedding party the nature of the place has changed. From a price perspective QV is an attractive option and as we've been told 'QV is value for money' but for us thats not enough. Would we return? Sad to say probably not."

","Beautiful place, a little expensive.","We are staying in Quinci Villas for 6 nights. It's the end of a long trip for us and this was our chance to chill in luxury before going back to the big city life.Quinci is a really nice hotel. Everything feels very high end. Furnitures, the rooms, the food, the service. The facilities in the hotel are first class.Â The 3 infinity pools are magnificent, they are surrounded with beautiful sun loungers and very comfy day beds. The kind that are really soft and wide.The beach isnt huge, but it's pretty, and well kept. Really clean everyday, the water is pristine and for those who enjoy surfing, there's a good beginners reef right opposite the hotel. The sunset on the hotel's beach is simply stunning.The restaurant is great. In fact there are two, serving a selection of Asian and Western food. They both face the ocean, the view is unbeatable. All food is very delicate and elegantly presented. If anything, servings arent very generous. The food is good but you're always left wanting a bit more, which is a shame. The wine selection is good too (considering you're on a tropical island), but forget desserts though.The bar makes good cocktails, and does a happy hour bogof between 5 and 7, very handy for a sunset drink. The Singapore Sling is one of the best I ever had.Service is broadly very good. Excellent command of English throughout and a friendly yet respectful staff does a really good job. There are lots of them so you always have someone around to help, without feeling surrounded.We rented a pool villa, which was beautiful. Really quiet and really comfy bed (two things that tend to be rare in Asia). Amazing exterior bathroom, and large terrace with a big comfy sofa. Shame they didnt put a TV in the room (would have loved to watch a movie or two in the evening). The exposition of the pool isnt great either (you get a lot of shade), but it doesnt take away from how awesome it is to wake up facing your own private pool.If you are looking to indulge in luxury, this is a really good place to stay.As ever, when you go boutique in Asia, there are a few bits that are hit and miss.The housekeeping in our room wasnt always done on time. We rented a pool villa, but privacy isnt great (some staff members will just barge in without notice). Hot water broke half way through, and a cold exterior shower really isnt ideal.The biggest problem was costs within the hotel really. Quincy is on Mangsit beach, which is about 10min drive from Sengiggi. Which itself, isnt a very lively place. So needless to say you spend most your time in the hotel. That was fine for us, it's what we wanted. But prices are quite simply ridiculous. A cocktail costs nearly $15. A meal for two doesnt come under $50, at best (and as I said earlier, portions are small). A cafe latte for breakfast is $4. Everything is hugely overpriced, and you're essentially paying Western prices in a developping country. Someone's making a lot of money out of this, and it just doesnt feel right. You kindda feel like you're being milked and it's not a very nice feeling. I dont mind paying a premium but here, it's just way too over the top.So you should try Quinci, it's a lovely place to stay. The staff are very nice and facilities very luxurious. But bear in mind prices are stupidly high and you'll be wondering why you spent double your original budget..."

","Fantastic villas set in a beautiful garden right on the beach","Have just left the Qunci and we want to go back already. The villas are just about perfect, with ample space to relax and unwind with seating both in the villa, and outside on the porch. The villa's interior was modern, but with a Lombok-influence, and had several pieces of art and statues within. The bathroom was semi-outdoors, but fully private. My only little moan was that the bed was too soft for me, but that's just a personal preference.The two restaurants served great food, although if you do not like fish or seafood, you may find that your choices for dinner are limited. Breakfast was al-a-carte and quite varied, with fresh fruit and juices.We will be coming back to the Qunci, and if you are heading to Lombok, I would suggest you do too!"

","A magic place","I stayed in Qunci Villas twice and both times I had a wonderful experience and cannot wait to go back a third time. The location is perfect on an island not yet as crowded as others in Indonesia (I was there in 2009 and 2011), although the opening of the new airport may have an impact soon. Rooms are spacious, carefully decorated with beautiful Symon paintings and other sculptures and have wonderful bathrooms with open air shower (I always went for garden view which is the standard room and it was great value for money). The architect did a great job everywhere in the hotel making the hotel feel peaceful, stylish and so special. The personnel is alway very nice and food delicious. Last but not least, the Spa is heaven and prices still affordable for a high level of service. Overall, my favorite hotel!"

","Perfectly pitched!","Qunci is a very classy but also exceptionally good value place to stay. We found the food at lunchtime and supper to be high quality and very reasonably priced - it was tasty but also well-cooked and nutritious! It's very easy in 'resort' hotels to find you go 5 days just eating fat, carbs and protein, but here the meals were served with a sizeable portion of fresh veg and the salads were really excellent. We particularly liked the whole fish, chilli prawns and the beef rending. In a 4-week trip, this was the only place we stayed where we didn't flinch at the hotel restaurant prices and were very happy to eat there, Breakfast was slightly variable. The choice was excellent but things like eggs benedict and huevos rancheros would be exceptional one day and mediocre the next. Happy hour cocktails are a great thing! Not strong, but this is the case throughout Bali and Lombok. The only slight concern we had was that very little drinking water is provided, despite the hot temperatures, and the prices for this at Qunci do seem quite steep - we would have racked up about Â£10 a day on water. But, there is a small shop just outside the front where you can buy large bottles.The pools are sizeable and the layout is such that, even though the place was full, we still had plenty of space. The beach immediately in front has quite a lot of stones just beyond the waters' edge, but if you walk 20m down there's a spot which is clear. The hawkers do feature - but in our view, not in a bad way. The beach massage lady is really good and cheap, and we also took a trip to the gilis with the boat guy next door which was great fun and good value. We had a partial ocean view room (the only room left as it was the middle of august and we booked very late) but it was well-equipped and with gorgeous pools and beach we had no need of a private pool villa and probably wouldn't have used it.For what you get at qunci, the price of the rooms is really impressively low. Even in high season, you get 92% of a truly top 5star place at around a third of the price, and to be honest a more friendly and relaxed atmosphere. For this,any small niggles with service should be overlooked. It's easy to see why this is such a popular and successful place and I hope more potential hoteliers take a leaf out of Qunci's book. I can't think of anyone to whom I wouldn't recommend a stay at Qunci and we will certainly return."

","Very pleasant stay at the Qunci Villas","We had a very enjoyable stay at Qunci villas in Sengiggi Lombok. We stayed in one their pool villas, which have their own private pool, which is very nice and we made good use of.What we liked about our stay at Qunci villas:- The interior design in the rooms is simple but beautiful, bathroom is nice (private open air shower) and the bed if comfy- The private pool and patio that comes with the pool villa is very nice- The hotel has three public pools and one of them is for adults only- The hotel has two restaurants and one bar area. - Barbecue night is a must. When we were there, the hotel had organised a barbecue night. The food was brilliant and the live music was so good. - The service is generally very good- Breakfast will satisfy most peopleAreas for improvement at Qunci Villas:- The wifi internet can be really slow- There is a beach at the back of the hotel. Do note that that part of the water is fairly rocky and the waves are quite tiny for surfing (you can surf, but have to wait long periods for proper waves and most waves dissipate quickly) - No dvd's or games in the room- There is no fitness centreTips when your visiting Senggigi:- Go to Coco beach restaurant (see my review) it's 3 minutes from the hotel and trust me you won't regret it!- Note that the rooms don't come with a tv, but you can call room service and they'll bring you one- Have a massage from the ladies on the beach instead of the hotel spa. It's much cheaper and very good"

","Nice resort hotel","We stayed 5 nights in a gardenview room. The room was spacious and clean. The bathroom was semi-covered allowing the possibility for mosquitoes to enter the bedroom when opening the door but this proved not be a problem as the hotel fumigates the grounds and room. The breakfast was nice but I wasn't too impressed by the evening meals at the restaurants. The room is priced for value but IMO the food is overpriced for the quality offered. The grounds of the hotel are immaculate and very comfortable. The staff are very helpful and friendly. As in some other places in Indonesia, watch out for the US dollar pricing which is later converted to rupiahs at a less than favourable rate. We paid our tabs at the restaurants daily as we don't like the occasional mistakes that lead to confusion by letting things accumulate until check out. Even though, at check out we were presented with a small charge (a soda water) that we didn't sign for. The person at the desk let it go. But, as we were entering our awaiting taxi to the airport, another person came asking again for payment even though we had not signed for the purchase. We just paid up as it was a really small amount and we were in a hurry to get to the airport. You would think that they would let it go considering that there was no signature, the amount was so small and we had given them substantial business during our stay. This experience really cheapened our stay which was otherwise very pleasant. Also, during our stay they offered guests 2 nights of ""special dinners"" that were outrageously priced and one of which that forced us to have to eat in a dark corner of one of the restaurants as we chose the regular menu. As far as resorts go Qunci is a good choice but at times I got the impression that there was some nickel and diming going on which soured what could have been an excellent stay."

","Wonderful family Experience","We stayed at the Villa Qusia which is a massive 3 bedroom villa on the hill above the hotel. The villa was fantastic with a gym, infinity pool Bose sound system and a fantastic view. On the down side it was a fair walk down to the hotel through rural Indonesia which could be a bit challenging for people who might not be used to it. The staff were great and the meals prepared were very good. We also ate at the hotel which was good however the beach was non existent. You will need to go somewhere else for a swim in the ocean. We were reluctant to leave as this was a very relaxing experience away from the typical busy reports."

","Magic","We stayed at Qunci Villas with our 12 year old in July 2012. Qunci is beautiful, the room we had was number 23 which was facing the ocean at the very south end of the resort. I think this is the best room, we have requested it for next years trip. There is some construction going on next door, one of the windows looks directly onto it but I swear they must be using rubber tools because I only heard an electric machine once during our 3 days there.The rooms were simple and lovely. The views were magic. Qunci provided a TV at our request so our daughter could watch TV in the evenings. Breakfast was great, we ate facing the ocean each day, you can choose from a selection of cooked breakfast plus fruit and tea/coffee and juice. There are 3 swimming pools, the one outside our room was our favourite. There is never any shortage of pool chairs (they are super comfy) and towels. Qunci is in a good location too, only 10 minutes by taxi to Senggigi.My only gripe was our airport pickup never turned up!"

","Wonderful resort, good price","We stayed at Qunci Villas for two nights -- a treat after several weeks of staying in budget places and trekking up Mount Rinjani. It was well worth it -- for what you get, I think it's reasonably priced (especially compared to similar resorts in Bali). The beach area, which features two pools and lots of room for sunbathing, is really well-designed. The rooms are spacious and clean and feature a lovely outdoor shower area and a balcony. The breakfast was huge and delicious (although the food at the restaurant was generally nothing special). My husband also really enjoyed his massage at the spa. My only complaint is that it was very difficult communicating with the wait staff. I wouldn't normally complain about that (since after all I came to Indonesia without speaking a word of the language!), but at a resort of this caliber, you should be able to ask basic questions about the menu and make basic drink requests without too much difficulty. But that's a minor issue. We'd definitely return to Qunci Villas if we're back in Lombok, and I'd highly recommend it."

","The best massage I ever had!!!","Lombok is a beautiful island however there is not much to do as a single woman traveling with a girlfriend. My massage at this hotel totally made up for it! Seriously one of the best massages I've ever had. I live in the U.S. and occasionally treat myself to a massage as they are usually $80 and up. This massage topped all of those. First off you get to choose what scents you want mixed in to your massage oil, then they provide you with some delicious tea. The massage room itself has beautiful decor, tastefully zen. You are given a comfy robe to wear. Had a traditional Balinese massage, almost fell asleep. Tried to stay at the hotel but they were booked. if you are headed to Lombok treat yourself to this hotel, beautiful grounds and excellent spa!"

","The perfect honeymoon","Hi! We stayed at Quncy with my wife for a few days in July 2012 for our honeymoon and it was just the perfect venue for this. It's just like if we had jumped into a wonderful postcard of Lombok! The beach is clean, the sea transparent and on bright days you'll have this stunning view of Gunung Agung on the horizon. I also really enjoyed the design and materials used for the hotel and furniture: wood, stone, just the right amount of local art, etc, this makes you feel like the place is part of the island while being modern, fresh and of top quality. The area fronting the beach with a couple of 'infinity pools' is perfect to rest, read or just sunbath. There is indeed people around and most of them are 'bole' but it is never quite like one of those big resorts in Bali. We found the staff very helpful, well trained and speaking good English. Every morning we would ordered breakfast in the room at a particular time and they were never late, waiting for us to open the door while carrying our heavy tray in one hand over the shoulder. We weren't particularly organized and the reception desk always helped us late at night to book our trip for the next day efficiently, successfully and with a smile. The restaurant has two chefs, one Indonesian and one French, and serves an excellent mix of European and Asian food. It was heartbreaking to leave and, living in Indonesia, we will definitely come back."

","Relaxing break","We stayed at Qunci villas because of the amazing reviews and the pictures showing how amazing this place is. We started our holiday in Bali and then wanted to go to Gili T but I wasn't sure about staying there for more than 1 night or catching the boat there so we flew to Lombok, stayed at Qunci for 2 nights and then caught a speed boat over to Gili T for 1 night.On reflection, we wouldn't have done the same thing if we had our time again. Although the flight is quick (half an hour) it is a 2 hour drive to Qunci from the airport and then another ~45mins to get over to Gili T (20 min drive + 15 min sped boat). On our last day this meant about 4 hours to get back to Bali from Gili T in total! Qunci is indeed a beautiful hotel. The gardens and surroundings are lovely, the pools are stunning and the rooms are really nice (we stayed in a partial ocean view room and it was more than adequate). Outdoor bathrooms are nice but a bit impractical given there are lots of Mozzies... They come and spray your room for Mozzies eac h night when they do turn down service which is a nice thought, but 1 night when I cameo back to our room to get something Nile they were doing it the door was wide open so that defeats the idea a bit!Food at Qunci was really lovely, we enjoyed everything we ate. Sitting down on the beachfront when you can get a table is something special. Prices very reasonable too considering most people do seem to stay at the hotel to eat. Staff were friendly enough but to be honest, compared to the people on Bali and Gili T the people here were not as friendly and did not speak very good English. I know it is a non English speaking country but it was a bit of a surprise and difficult to adjust to after being in Bali where everyone seemed to speak perfect English! We didn't leave the resort so we can't comment much on the greater area. The beach in front is quite nice (we didn't swim but did go for a morning beach walk). The hawkers were not an issue for us at all. They were so friendly and like in Bali, we found if you didn't make eye contact or just said you weren't interested they didn't bother you. I had a massage from one of the ladies on the beach in the sampan for 100,000 (price seemed non negotiable) and it was quite good.Overall we enjoyed our time here relaxing by the pool but if we had our time again we would have caught a boat straight from Bali to the Gilis and stayed there for 3 nights - there are stunning beaches here and a very chilled vibe (note tho Gili T has a very young clientele - think we saw about 4 people over 35!!)"

","It IS that Wonderful!!","Iâm not one to laud a business or service publicly unless it rises so far and above my expectations that it leaves me, well, speechless. Qunci is one such place.Qunci is promoted as your âkey to an idyllic Lombokâ and they do not fail to deliver. From the moment you are met at the airport, your personal comfort and needs are being addressed. The Qunci driver came equipped with ice cold towels, bottles of water and a smile â all very much appreciated after the hustle of traveling 30+ hours. Despite the craziness of cars and mopeds and pedestrians that make up the traffic in Indonesia, the Qunci driver delivered us calmly and securely to the hotel where we were welcomed by name, efficiently checked in, and presented with a âwelcomeâ drink that is still a mystery to me but was very refreshing. The hotel itself has a âwowâ factor that immediately promises pampering and relaxation. The overall effect of stone, marble, water, wood and textures melt seamlessly into artistic structures subtly lit to make everything feel warm and inviting. The grounds are immaculate. The fountains, water features and pools are crystal clear at all times. [Having spent my time in college cleaning hotels, I fully appreciate the effort and staff it takes to keep things in such pristine condition every day.] The rooms are just as clean, beds comfortable and rain showers in every bathroom â not that youâll want to spend much time in them as the poolside and ocean view lounges compel you to be outdoors where the sun, colors and breezes of Lombok literally feed the soul.Whereas all these amenities would be a plus at any hotel, the thing I believe that makes Qunci truly idyllic is its staff. It was the numerous individuals that made our once-in-a-life-time vacation a dream-come-true. They met our requests with eagerness, smiles and the occasional sense of humor. We learned their names and they learned ours. You could tell that they enjoy working at Qunci and it reflected in their service. It constantly amazed me that with the multiple nationalities and languages represented amongst the Qunci guests, the staff never wavered from communicating or meeting the requests of each person. It was the services of staff such as our Villa Qunang butlers Aden (butler #2, our âspidermanâ) and Awel (butler #1, gifted with entertaining children with his guitar playing); Oni and Fatma (restaurant wait staff who made sure our meals were exactly what we wanted); Addie, Gatot and Ngurah (poolside staff who diligently checked to make sure we had everything we needed from drinks to appetizers to clean towels); Rudy and Wira (who competently drove us to and from the hotel); Rini, Astiti and Karmila (skilled spa staff who helped us to begin to relax through massage, pedicures and manicures); as well as, the staff behind the scenes - maintenance, laundry, cleaning staff and Iâm sure numerous others that we tip our hats to in thanks of a memorable vacation.This was our first adventure outside the states and it was amazing. The cultural flavor of the mosqueâs âsingingâ the Koran in the morning or the roosters, goats and cows wandering free along the roads or the negotiating with the vendors for their wares along the beaches or in the markets just added to the exotic adventure of a life time. If you choose Qunci, you will not be disappointed. Things we learned while being there were â¦..First, take advantage of the spa services when you arrive to start relaxing that much sooner. With the newest addition to the hotel, a brand new facility was built that offers amazing services including 4 types of massage in addition to couples massage and reflexology. Secondly, try things you may not necessarily try such as the Fidjian I - Taukei Ho 'Ota Fish & Prawns Ceviche â a fabulous citrus prawn salad served in a coconut shell or the Lapindo â an addictive chocolate lava cake served with fresh fruit or for the kids âGreen Sands Shandyâ â apple/lime soda which pours like beer (to our sonâs amusement). The menus at each restaurant were amazing with chefs gathered from all over the world contributing â you will find more then just Indonesian food and everything is fresh daily. And finally, if you need something donât hesitate to ask - the staff will either help you locate or actually go get what you need even if they donât have it right there at the hotel.Weâve been asked numerous times if it was worth it; if we would go again. For us, even with the 30 hours flight time that it took â yes, we would go again. It IS that wonderful!"

","Very nice place!","They would get 5 star rating if not only the appartments lack a little bit of privacy. Thats the only deficit, because the appartments are close to each other and you can see your neighbours and other way round. If you dont care about that go for it! :)Apart from that the place was perfect! Very nice rooms perfectly nice and helpfull staff! They really were exceptionall nice and helpfull! Big thanks for that! Food was delicious and the beach and view is perfect! No reason to avoid this place! Would always come back to them! The place is wonderfully beautifull designed.If you can choose the rooms on the first floor, it gives a bit more privacy.Thanks!:)"

","A BREATHTAKING HAVEN","Qunci Villas is a breathtaking haven that allows you to catch your breath and take a break, from our now turbulent world and get back in touch with yourself, someone you love, nature and a different culture. My partner and I, who have traveled all over the world in our 33 years together, just spent 17 days at this wonderful complex and were blown away by the consideration and attention we received there. The staff, always referring to us as âMr. Don and Mr. Jerry,â was not only friendly, always smiling, but did everything possible to make our stay nothing but an unforgettable, pleasurable memoryâ¦ and that it was. Our original intent was, during that 17 day period, to leave Qunci for several days and spend time on the island of Bali, but we were so enthralled by the beauty and atmosphere of Qunci Villas that we did not want to leave. Everything we needed was right there. We were not looking for party time, night life or excitement, but peace, tranquility and a chance to catch our breath from our hectic pace of life and just unwindâ¦and be spoiled for a time. And yes, we were spoiled in this dream-like setting. The sunsets, every evening, often with a view of Bali, at happy hour time, took your breath away. A swim in any one of the three infinity pools, looking out at the ocean was beyond refreshing. The massages at the Spa, from Traditional Lombok, Aromatic, to Swedish given by the gentle-natured, skilled Indonesian technicians was the pinnacle of relaxation. And the reflexologyâ¦.WOWâ¦ talk about healing! Dinners were a delight, served Oceanside some evenings at candlelit tables, with nearby musician on traditional instruments to entertain you, and sometimes Sadek dancers in ornate, traditional costumes. Or sometimes barbeques on the beach, or Indonesian evenings when food carts are set up outside with Indonesian chefs preparing traditional dishes. Some evenings we chose to sit in one of the open-air dining rooms with views of the ocean. On one very special evening we took advantage of the âRomantic Dinnerâ for couples( honeymooners or otherwise) where the staff had decorated one of the cabanas that set on the beach, next to the ocean, with shear white fabric tied at each corner post to form a canopy. Sitting in the middle of the cabana was a table draped in a white satin cloth. On the table were tall, white, living orchids and a large centerpiece of seashells and fruit along with an enormous white, glowing candle. Flower pedals had been spread around the table on the floor. Pink and yellow blossoms from the Cambodia trees had been strung and hung from the ceiling. A young, Indonesian man with an amazing smile, cheerful laugh and gentle nature was our personal server for the evening. Lobster Thermidor, candlelight, flowers, sunset turning to moonlight on ocean waves and someone who had been by your side for thirty-three years, how perfect is that?And thatâs how it was for the two of us at Qunci Villas. Every day Perfect! No, the prayers from the mosque didnât bother us. We found it somewhat comforting and fit the environment and culture we were in. Mostly it was the sound of the ocean waves lapping against the beach that woke us up in the mornings. And noise? What noise? Just the sound of the ocean or of birds singing in the overhead palm tree or flowering Cambodia treesâ¦or the distant sounds of laughter of the children from the school across the street. Happy soundsâ¦ not noise. And no, we were not disturbed by the hawkers on the beach. They had beautiful wares to sell if you were interested, and beautiful smiles to share, and IF you took a moment to get to know them a bit and learn of their culture and their lives, you would find beautiful people just trying to make a living to support their families. Mostly, we loved our experiences with the hawkers and we found when we didnât want to be bothered at the time, all we needed to do was to just look away.  We were amazed to find that Qunci Villas catered to people from all over the globe. The guest list read like the Olympicsâ opening ceremony Parade of the Atheletesâ¦..Italy, Spain, England, Australia, Holland, France, USA, Africa, Canada, Russia, England, Spain, â¦.people of so many different nationalities, races, color. No discrimination of any kind here. In the 17 days, we witnessed honeymooning couples, loving families, same-sex couples, inter-racial couples, from different walks of life, from different countries, all sharing space together in harmony with each other. In all of our travels, only at Qunci have we experienced this. We canât say enough about this little piece of paradiseâ¦and YESâ¦we would go back again and again and again.Don and Jerry"

","Qunci is cool but local community art and projects need support","Qunci itself is a terrific place to stay and others have said it all before about the great food, modern apartments spa, amazing sunsets etc. We may be a bit different to other guests in that we wanted to explore the culture beyond the confines of the resort where the only engagement with locals is the young wait staff and beach hawkers selling mediocre sarongs and jewellery. The major attractions of Kuta beach in the south and the waterfalls near Mt Rinjani in the north are both full days trips by car which must deter many on short trips. There is not much to see or do in Senggigi, with tourism infrastructure still developing. But we did discover a wonderful antique shop/museum run by a wise old Sasak gentleman called Sudirman who serves customers Lombok coffee and tells great stories of his interesting life and island in fluent English. He stocks primitive and classic treasures from all over Lombok and neighbouring islands like Sumba and Timor. We also stumbled on waterfalls near Gangga just an hour to the north where locals from a picture postcard village are building a tourist garden and change room to generate a small income. The village children mobbed us and delighted us with their antics. Qunci is a terrific employer of local staff who get excellent training. It would be great to see western owned tourism operators in Lombok and Bali do their bit to help local people build infrastructure, capacity and independence to share in the spoils of tourism and in turn expand the experience for visitors."

","Heaven found in lombok","I have been to Bali 7 times and still love exploring the island. This is my first time to Lombok and what a great place I have discovered. It is like the old Bali. Quncy Villas are are going to woo me back next year.They are set in stunning gardens and beach front. The staff are amazing, so friendlyand helpful. The rooms are gorgeous with outside showers, very quiet with well appointed features. The day beds on the decks are a lovely place to curl up. The pools here would have to be the best I have swum in. The salt water is so clean and refreshing no worries about sore eyes, plenty of very comfortable deck beds to laze around on with thick large towells. The resort is so wonderful it is hard to leave it to explore other parts of this beautiful island. Spoil yourself at the spa it is wonderful. The breakfasts are great and the resturant serves good food. Many other great place to eat in town ( a very cheap taxi ride). I would recommend the Square resturant.Take a local boat from the front of the resort over to the amazing Gili Islands for a day of snorkelling. The water is warm and the snorkelling fantastic. The turtles are plentiful and there is an abundance of sealife. Scallywags resturant on Gili Air is a must for lunch. A great way to spend a day. Next time I will take the fast boat to Lombok instead of flying. Quncy would have to be the best place I have stayed in, great value for money. I will be back to this beautiful resort."

","Loved Every Minute","Our family of five stayed here with another family of five.We were in the large 2 bedroom villa which is across the road and up the hill from the main resort. A car was available to drive you up and down if you didn't feel up to the 5 minute walk.Our friends had two ocean view rooms, upstairs and downstairs from each other, really close to the main pool.The combination was perfect, as those that wanted to be in the resort could be, and anyone wanting time out stayed in the villa. The villa had a butler from 7am to 11pm, who looked after us and the villa perfectly. One night we had a chef from the resort cook dinner for the 10 of us in the villa, it was one of the best meals of our three weeks in Lombok and Bali. The whole experience was luxurious and indulgent.The restaurants in the resort were also delicious and apart from exploring there was no reason to leave. Rightly described as ""a destination in itself"", Quinci Villas was very special, and we would be back in a heartbeat. Excellent value for fabulous luxury."

","Relaxing stay!","Got a good deal on this hotel as they were having quite a lot of work done, the first room we rejected as the workmen were actually sitting on the doorstep so we were moved to another villa away from the noise.Fabulous accommodation! Large room with outside bathroom facilities and good air-con. We used the restaurant for breakfast and dinner and it was lovely food and very reasonable. It is a short taxi ride from the town but having made the trip there one day there really wasn't anything to do or see there for more than a couple of hours. Infinity pools great and there are quite a few hawkers on the beach but not too intrusive especially if you do want to take home some souvenirs. Drinks quite expensive due to tax but we stuck to happy hour and beer so not to bad. All in all a very good choice in the are as we did not like the other Hotels in town. All the staff were very attentive!"

","Qunci - relax, restore, rejuvenate!","Had my second trip to Qunci recently with a group of thirteeen family and friends. Although popular as a couples/honeymoon venue, Qunci can cater for all, especially now with the fantastic new extensions! The value is incredible given the other prices of other 5-star resorts along Senggigi - compare it and see for yourself. Find Barham on the beach and he'll take you touring on day trips to Senaru Falls, Mataram shopping, Gili Narggu or Trawangan, Kuta, or just visit the nearby Monkey Forest. You must visit the resorts Spa & have mulitple treatments!! Absolute bliss! Say Hi to Saiful and War for me! You'll love this place and won't want to leave - I promise!"

","Alone together - naturally","Superbly appointed villas and superior friendly service that was never forced or pressured. The pool villa was private but never far from company. The spa provided a terrific range of treatments and the dining options were wonderful too. The carefully manicured tropical gardens displayed an attention to detail that made every stroll an experience.We were in a group of friends gathered to celebrate a significant birthday of a dear friend. The resort delivered great experiences for us all.After years of visiting Bali we wonder why we left Lombok until now, but just in time we now can't wait to return. Far from the traffic congestion that now seems an everyday feature of Bali's resort scene, Lombok is a must return. And so too Qunci."

","Wedding in Paradise!","My partner & I had been here once before and fell in love with the caring, kind and genuinely friendly staff. The hotel itself is amazing - the location beautiful, the rooms elegant & spacious, the food delicious, the pools perfect for a day of relaxing, and the sunsets spectacular. Of the 20 or so people in our wedding group, every single one said they'd definitely come back. And they are fussy travelers. We all used the spa - even the blokey blokes - and found it indulgent and excellent value for money.Our wedding ceremony was on the beach. A stunning sunset location. Some details such as flower co ours and arrangements were lost in translation but on the day it didn't really matter because the beauty of the staff & surrounds made up for it. We had our reception at Villa Qusia on the hill behind the hotel. It was a grand nite topped off by fine food & wine. We had a few issues with their sound system not playing Ipod but wouldn't have changed the venue for the world! The location is exotically spectacular. We especially loved the sound of the call to prayer echoing through the house, hotel and village as a reminder of where you really were.We drove much further north to look at the Tugu and Oberoi hotels but they had nothing on Qunci. They were stiff, sterile and expensive and lacking the Qunci charm. We will definitely be going back. One final note, if you enjoy your wine as we do, traveling in an Indonesian country, can be very expensive ($60-70) bottle but everything else is reasonably priced. If you like a drink while at Qunci, a couple of happy hour cocktails will get you well started. Senggigi town is a Short USD2 cab ride away & great fun for a nite out or lovely meal."

","incredible place and service","stayed there a couple of years ago for a week and it was an extreme pleasant stay in an environment that was very well thought. We had a little villa with a private pool, and the room was equally perfect, specially the outdoor bathroom. can recommend this for a couple trip, and also with children.the only thing is that the beach in front of the hotel was probably not the easiest place to swim, at least the days we were there, because of massive waves. Check Gilli islands for that ;-)excellent place, excellent location, and excellent staff. No need to say more"

","What a lovely place!","My partner and I spent 7 nights at Qunci Villas in June. We were very impressed with the grounds and the peaceful surrounds. The pools are lovely and there were always lots of lounge chairs to choose from, whether in the shade or sun.Great cocktails at the bar during happy hour and I had a brief conversation with the consultant who was brought it to train the staff of the new bar. What a great idea and all the staff seemed really happy to be there and enjoying their job.We had a couple of meals in the restaurant, one of which was lovely, the other was a bit bland. I realise that the staff in the restaurant are undergoing continual training in service and English but there were a few frustrating moments and blank stares. At the end of the day, meals were very pleasant but service wasn't up to scratch. There seemed to be a lot of staff around but just getting a menu to begin with took too long.Breakfasts were amazing, great choices and beautiful location right on the beach. The hawkers on the beach didnt really bother me as much as I thought. Just a polite 'no thanks' and they left me alone. The massages from the hawker ladies were excellent, I think we had 5 massages during the week! We also organised a boat trip to the Gili Islands with a local guy who wanders along the beach most days - we ended up having a great time. So although the hawkers may be annoying to some, we made the most of them and ended up with some really great experiences.The noise from the mosque is unavoidable in Lombok, so take some earplugs and if you get woken up, pop your ear plugs in, roll over then go back to sleep!The front desk staff were very helpful and friendly.All the pictures you see on these reviews and on the internet are spot on! The grounds are lovely and well maintained, there was always men in the gardens or pottering around cleaning etc.Our room was amazing! Room number 8 - ocean view room. We think it was the best room in the whole place- great views over the pool and resort grounds but quite private at the same time.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Qunci Villas to anyone looking for a lovely, relaxing time away. Although we did a few day trips (Gili Islands, Kuta Lombok) I would have been more than happy to spend my whole week at Qunci, just relaxing."

","Great beach view, nice premises, a few minor things to work on","We stayed 4 nights in the room 23, one of their ocean view upstairs rooms, and as a staff member confirmed, the one used to make quite a lot of photos for their web site. The view out of this room is wow-so-beautiful; I know that for sure as my husband ended up with it as a new cover picture on his i-Phone. The room was very nicely appointed, and as a trip to Lombok was a part of our (belated) honeymoon, on the first night they had set up a beautiful and most impressive orchid and mini candles composition over the bed, with a huge heart laid out with yellow frangipanis on the bed cover, and a generous slice of a very yummy strawberry cake for two - all free and total surprise. This was SO nice! The only minor problem with our room (a jamming bathroom door) was promptly fixed after mentioning aboot it at the front desk next morning. We were really impressed by the hotel premises and the landscaping - so stylish and thought through, a visualization of the tropical paradise. The front desk staff were so helpful and friendly. I know that some reviewers were not too thrilled about the nearby mosque evening and/or morning prayers routine, but it didn't bother us at all, rather added an exotic touch, when we heard it at all. What was a bit more frustrating was actually a construction next door. Room 23 is located on the left side of the property (if you face the ocean), actually by the property fence; well the construction site is on the other side of this fence. I must admit that the soundtrack from hammers and saws at 10pm was much more frustrating then the prayers. Additional training given to the waiting staff could probably be helpful, as the service was sometimes a mixed bag: absolutely top notch one day and not so the next. Like, once we waited for a glass of wine before dinner for 45 minutes and eventually moved to a dinner table and only then got the wine, or the waiter would come up and ask what we would want for dessert, take my order - and then walk away to the next table without asking my husband if he wants one too. The quality of food and drinks was generally very nice but I cared less for some items; for example, their pumpkin coconut soup with shrimps is to die for but the appetizer of scallops is three tiny - I ain't kidding you, each probably a size of the quarter - scallops smartly presented on sea shells but providing not much in terms of taste and volume. Stick to the soup! Another interesting memory is their twist on the Bloody Mary cocktail, something that I, not a big cocktail lover, am very fond of - never before I had a Bloody Mary that tasted like it almost had no tomato juice in it and rather resembled a fruit punch. Oh and it came with a cucumber slice, not a selery stalk, though the drink menu, as I recall, specifically mentioned selery. But on the brighter side, their happy hour is quite generous, two drinks for the price of one from 5-7pm. We usually don't do a lot of cocktails but Qunci definitely provides ample opportunities to explore their drink menu further. Another very positive part of our stay was their spa. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! During the 4-nights stay we had three massages each - that tells you something right off the bat. Can't praise it enough. Beach vendors didn't bother us too much; as other guests mentioned, if you don't want to be bugged, don't interact with them; usually a polite No, thanks with a smile was enough. All in all, a really nice stay. I am seriously thinking that if we ever decide to return to Indonesia in the future, we would pass Nusa Dua in Bali for the beach holiday alltogether and instead would come to Qunci that has a much better beach for a much better price."

","Beautiful and relaxing.","A friend and I made a quick two day trip from Bali to stay at Qunci and visit old haunts. It is a magic place to stay. I stayed in a Garden View room - great styling and amazing bathroom. Three pools to choose from, right on the beach, with great service. Two restaurants, both fab. Breakfast is included and is a set menu from I think five choices. Not your usual breakfast fare either, different and catering to different tastes and cultures. Sitting on the deck facing the ocean while eating breakfast was magic. The newly opened spa location was also great- I visited twice, service was excellent and, again, offering something a little different from the norm. Staff are great, they arranged flight from Bali and airport transfers for us. A great option for fuss free travel. I LOVE IT. Can't say enough positive about it. Great for friends, couples of all ages and families who don't seek high adrenalin adventures. I'll be back in December with the man and two teenagers- the free and reliable wifi will keep them amused. Terima kasih banyak. :)"

","Potential there but still needs a few tweaks","We stayed for 3 night with two young children and found Qunci not very child friendly particularly young children. Although we did see several children of varying ages floating around not much thought or effort seemed to placed on families with children. The grounds were aesthetically pleasing and generally well maintained but the pathways throughout were made with large square stones with significant gaps in between or alternatively laid with large uneven sharpish natural stones. Both of which looked stylistically nice but was not usable with strollers and also made it slightly hazardous for young ones to walk around. Even under supervision our kids got a few scrapes and cuts from falls. We took the second story room for the view and privacy but we did have to use stairs - in retrospect the ground floor might have been better with kids. We ate at the restaurants most of the time as there is nothing really around outside the villas and asked for a high chair on the first two visits to Quali and although they said yes we were disappointed both times. The first time they came back and said they couldn't fine one and the second time we were told they only had one and it was already being used. We gave up asking after this. We checked in very late and our partial sea-view room had several issues hopefully a one off. The washroom door would not shut properly and would open on its own when shut - so the mozzies got in from the semi-outdoor toilet/shower. In addition the door knob from the main entrance fell off completely on both sides when we opened it the next morning. There was also a crack in the window pane and a broken drinking glass to boot. After several calls in the morning and a visit to the reception they sent one technician up who tried repair the doors for some time without sucess...after many hours wasted I spoke the assistant then general manager and got the room changed. The second room was in much better shape - everything worked!, and to their credit they waived the first night without any prompting. As mentioned we ate at villa restaurants most of the time and although we saw a lot of employees floating around and was quickly approached the quality of the service staff was lacking once interaction began. On the night at Quali when they had a local dance show we booked a table in the morning after reviewing the a la cart menu - the employee even walked us over to the table near the front to assure good viewing and made the booking for us (I even saw the table layout on his reservation sheet). When we arrived that evening we noticed that the table supposedly reserved for us was taken already and was seated a few tables back. Once seated the a la carte menu was missing as well and the server proceeded to tell me that they were only serving the set menu that night. I could see other diners eating a la carte items and I did review the a la carte menu in the morning before making the booking and told them I would be ordering off that menu as we wanted more Asian inspired food (the set menu was western). When I told him to go check the kitchen to see if I can order a la carte he went off in a huff and returned with the a la carte menu without any explanation or apology. We waited some time for the food and when I asked them to check our order they eventually came out with the wrong menu items - it seemed like they had forgotten our order?! Mistakes were made with our orders during breakfast as well. After this we just ordered the rest of our meals in our room which went more smoothly...to be fair the food minus the staff in general was well presented and generally tasty with reasonable variety particularly liking the breakfast. Outside of hotel we were woken up a few times by the 5am morning prayers but I guess this is out of the hotel's control and it's part of the local culture/religion which should be respected but noted if you want complete solitude in the mornings. There was some touting near the pools and beach which was expected and in the end they probably wouldn't be there if the guest didn't buy or socialize with them - I did see some friendly interaction from some of the guests...On the positive all the restaurants + bar + 3 pools were well laid out in front of the sea and easily accessible. We did have a couple of massages at the spa which was pretty good and fairly priced for the ambiance and quality. The deck in the Villa was great particularly for the meals after unfortunately giving up on the restaurants. With the issues we had I would of probably left a lower rating but the Qunci was tastefully decorated throughout and found the pricing for the relatively spacious rooms + deck, F&B outlets, and spa to be reasonable for the quality and we would of probably enjoyed it more if we didn't have the kids with us as it is very much geared towards a romantic getaway for couples in my opinion. Two final points - 1) the staff needs to better trained - always seemed to take several calls or repetitive requests to get things done often wrongly. Even with 2-3 staff members around I never got the confidence they knew what they were doing or advising me correctly 2) I think management needs to decide if they want to be more family oriented or not and make more efforts towards that end making it clear going forward instead of making a lackluster attempt at it which inevitably creates disappointment."

","one of the highlights of our trip","This place is brilliant. We had a room very close to the pool and ocean which was lovely. Any of the ocean view rooms should be similar. All the staff were really nice and the prices for food and drinks quite reasonable. On that note the food was amazing (we ate lunch, dinner, and some mid afternoon snacks there each day)... don't miss cocktail hour at 5ish as the sun goes down too. The outdoor shower was lovely, and the rest of the room really luxurious and fresh. Breakfast is served down by the beach and was really tasty for a leisurely breakfast. THere's some English language newspapers and if you like a muddy coffee, the Lombok coffee is great. If not, they do a good espresso too. Hard to find much not to like - staff also really friendly and helpful.There's super cheap massages from hawkers on the beach, but the hotel spa is actually reasonable and a really good massage too. Again, the people are lovely. The men and ladies selling stuff on the beach are nowhere near as intense as in Seminyak (for example). Excellent place to chill and dont forget to hire a scooter and check out the deserted beaches towards Bengsal harbour."

","Nice place with poor service and standards","My husband and I went for a 7 night stay at Qunci Villas to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We were enticed by the very good feedback from other tourists; however we were very disappointed. We would never come back nor recommend it.We had specifically requested ""a quiet and calm room"". We were given nÂ° 11, which was beside a construction site operating every day from 8 - 17h plus a nearby mosque loudly calling for prayer five times a day, including the 4am call. The constant noise of hammers against the stone, the drilling and non drilling machines, the builders' noise were not our idea of quietness. Nobody ever informed us of this issue when asking for availability of rooms, when booking or when arriving. We unpleasantly discovered it by ourselves.The room we were assigned was ran down and was poorly cleaned every day. Our sheets were never changed at all during our stay; two visible stains on the lower sheet were our loyal companions during our seven nights. There was no WC brush and the interior of the WC was not regularly cleaned by the staff. The stone shelf placed to store all our toiletries was cleaned only once out of 7 days, and one could see as days passed the marks of liquids and grease on the stone coming out of the bottles we used. The shampoo and conditioner bottles at the shower place were empty when we arrived and were never refilled, therefore we used our own products. There was a decorative stone recipient with water and flowers in the bathroom; it looked lovely when we arrived but after a few days (we stayed 7 nights / 9 days) the flowers faded and nobody changed them or threw them away; brown faded flowers kept on floating there when we left. There were also some plants gone dry, falling over the shower platform. Neither these were cut or the shower platform cleared.The illumination was poor. No light at all in the shower area (what at night was a challenge) and no light in the closet area. It should have been illuminated by a lamp placed ad hoc but the bulb was broken and nobody cared to repair it. Again another challenge to properly see and arrange our clothes.On our fourth morning I called the customer service to complain about the noise. A lady answered they would stop the work, but after ten minutes the noise continued as usual. We then went for breakfast and upon our return I decided to call again and complain about the noise together with the cleaning standards and deficient condition of the room. Curiously the line was engaged. I made three more calls along that morning to the customer service; since the line remained engaged I went to the reception and asked to talk to the manager about the noise and cleaning service of our room. I was informed management was unavailable but would come back to me later. Nobody did that day or any day afterwards.When we checked out we commented that we had not been happy at all during our stay and we would like to give our feedback verbally to the management. Again we were told they were busy but would come back to us; which the assistant manager did, six hours later. He came to us ten minutes before our departure (he knew at what time we would leave since we had ordered a cab to the airport). He thanked our feedback and, as an apology, offered to pay our cab. It was a nice gesture, but I would have expected a different management attitude (or customer service) and an early reaction to our discomfort. I would have expected that our request of talking to management on the fourth day would have been granted; that we would have been listened to and the deficiencies in the service would have been remediated. I could continue talking about the extremely slow service in the restaurant and the inattentive waiters. One day for dinner I ordered a starter, a main course and in order to reduce waiting time I already announced I would like a dessert that took 20 minutes to prepare (a hot cake with a scope of ice cream). After the starter the waitress brought the dessert ?!?!?!?!?!?!? I reminded her I had ordered a main course. She put the dessert away and brought the main course, but when it was the right time to bring dessert she came to the table with the initial plate, obviously the ice cream was melted and the hot cake gone cold. I pointed that out and she said I would have to wait then 20 minutes to get a new dessert. I did not have dessert that day. . . The pool is nicely designed, but the sun beds are too close to each other. When someone is smoking cigars, one gets all the smoke. We had that unpleasant situation one day and we had to go back to our room; nobody would ask the cigar smoker to leave and it was the non smokers who had to do it.The internet connection is very slow, it comes and goes and one evening it was completely down. Additionally it was impossible to use Skype at all any day. There are hawkers at the beach selling whatever, bothering customers and spoiling the sea view and ruining any chance of tranquility already from breakfast time. The hotel does nothing to avoid this. The logo of the hotel is ""your key to idyllic Lombok"". I did not find my stay idyllic. If you are NOT keen on calm and tranquility, cleanliness and a customer oriented service when you travel, you might find then find Qunci villas idyllic; otherwise I would not recommend it. Definitely it is not worth to travel to the other side of the world (we live in Europe) to have such an experience and it was the wrong place to celebrate our wedding anniversary (btw, the hotel did not make any remark on this not even write a simple happy anniversary note)."

","Quite different but simply outstanding","We stayed at Qunci in early June for a friends wedding. There were around 16 of us all up with another 4 at other resorts as they were full.We stayed in an ocean front room (Room 53) and were initally disappointed that we did not have an upstairs room and it was relatively close to the restaurant. But we very quickly learnt that we had prime position and all our friends kept telling us so. Yes we were right behind the pool at ground level but it really felt like we were sitting in the garden. We had a wonderful cool ocean breeze and the ground floor rooms are also so much cooler even when you had them locked up (Actually we hardly ever locked it up because we were right in front of it at the pool). In contrast our friends rooms on the top floor got quite hot during the day.As I like to sit by the pool and my husband has quite fair skin he could sit on the day bed on the balcony of our room right behind me as I was sitting by the pool.Another benefit is that we got absolutely no noise on the ground floor. I know some people have complained about the early morning prayers (which of course is part of Indonesia culture and should be embraced) but we heard nothing.The food and the staff were simply outstanding. The staff could not do enough for you. As we were close to the restaurant we would just run over and order something and it would be delivered to our deck within 10-15 minutes no matter what time of day. We did venture out a dine locally but the food at the restaurant is outstanding (love the pavlova!)I know a few people have complained about no TV, which was a bit weird at first. All you have to do is ask and they will bring one in. As I said, the staff are outstanding!If I had one complaint it would have to be the noisy peole upstair (Room 52 - also prime position). It sounded like they were moving furniture constantly which got to be very annoying. But we identified pretty quickly that our upstairs neighbour was a friend of the owner!"

","Amazing!","This is an incredible place. It's stylish, it's luxurious, it's friendly, it's everything you could want in a resort.The rooms are spectacular - you even have your own statue in your room and an outdoor shower. The decor is great and the furnishings are top quality. We were fortunate enough to stay in both the Partial Ocean View and the Luxury One Bedroom Villa. The Partial Ocean View Room was fantastic - spacious with everything you could need. It is all very modern and comfortable. But the Luxury One Bedroom Villa really great, and worth the extra $$ if you have it. It is completely private and relaxing, with everything you could possibly need. It is very spacious and comfortable.The Spa is also a great experience, and it's worthwhile trying a couple of different things. We had the massage and the facial and they were both very good.The pools are great - there are three of them. Most people spend a lot of time sitting down by the pool on the comfortable deck chairs, but the rooms all have huge balconies too, with comfortable seating.I really can't say enough about this place. If you are in Lombok you should stay here!"

","Very nicely done","I believe the other reviews speak for themselves and no need to add too much here, on the whole we like a lot :). The only thing they really must fix is the Coffee @ breakfast - we've been here 5x days and it is no better than dirty dishwater... if you want a real coffee like an Expresso they charge a huge 'extra"" amount for that... I stay @ many hotels in Indonesia for work and can say that the coffee @ breakfast @ Qunci Villas is by far the worst I've had in Indonesia... pity, I do hope someone reads this and fixes... still here another 4 days.. :)"

","Paradise on Earth!","Stayed 3 nights in a 1 bedroom with pool villa from 11 June till 14 June. Everything about Qunci was just PERFECT, ranging from the food to the service level. Staff were always smiling and greeting you whenever they see you. Food from the two restaurants were fantastic and we had almost all our meals in the resort except for one lunch when we went for a day trip to the Gilis. Rooms are spacious and clean. I had provided additional instructions before arrival to assist with a banner and a 99 roses bouquet as I was planning my proposal. Everything was executed beautifully as planned. Will like to give special thanks to two particular staff, Gatot and Nova. Gatot was in charge of our gazebo dinner and his dedicated service was one of the main reasons why we truly enjoy our dinner that night. On our request, Nova went to find a box to contain our 99 rose bouquet in order to bring it back home. In addition, he even cut the roses stems to ensure they fit the box (imagine cutting 99 stalks of roses using a normal pair of scissors)The only drawback I can think of is that the hotel is a 1.5 hours drive away from the airport. Nonetheless Sengigi is the main tourist stretch and the airport transfer is as comfortable as it can get. Qunci definitely left a beautiful memory in our minds and we will definitely be back soon!"

","Complete relaxation","Travelled to Qunci Villas by taxi from Praya Airport - approx 11/2 hours 250,000 IDR. Check in was swift. Our first dining experience at Quncic was fantastic as we were so hungry by 9.30pm when we arrived. Candle lit, beach side tables with views of the surf set the zen tone for the whole stay. I used the spa once, which I would recommend however there are two ladies who offer various massage and beauty services on the beach front of Qunci which I also recommend. Beware the hawkers who are friendly and pleasent who also hang out around the beach front. As a first time visitor to Lombok I found the locals authentic and friendly and will definitely be returning. I was surprised to find there was no television in our room but I didn't miss it in the least it made my holiday all the more relaxing. Take plenty of books."

","Almost perfect","I loved staying here but wish we had a better room. After sending a couple of emails and receiving no response I called the villas on the day to check if they had received my emails but they hadnt however they did quickly accommodate us and organised transfers for later that day. Our room was close to the road and next to a vacant block of land. We were woken early morning by the call to prayer as well as the rooster next door joining in which in the begginging we found funny. The rooms was upstairs and had a lovely balcony with day bed. We used this a lot except we had quite a bit of noise from construction going on throughout the day. We only stayed two nights in the end then moved to the Sheraton as the next day, we also had the school across the room with music being amplified at 8am in the morning which was enough to make us move on. The grounds and pools are lovely. The staff are excellent. Had wonderful meals in the restaurants and met the chefs. It was awesome!, Breakfast is alacarte and very good. Spent a day around the Gili's snorkelling which was great. Organise this by going down the beach and heading right and look for Eddie. He looks after your and wants to show you the reefs. We paid 450000 rp for the day. Would have said it was a perfect hotel except for the noise."

","Sublime","We arrived by boat to Lombok via the Gili Islands, & were picked up by a Qunci driver from the harbour. After a beautiful 20 min drive to the hotel, and a smooth check in, we were in our room. For approx $145/night we were impressed. It was simple, chic & everything worked. The semi outdoor bathroom was large, the bed comfy & the outdoor lounge great for reading. Breakfasts were a wonderful spread of tropical fruits, eggs & all the toppings. We spent most our time by the fantastic infinity pool. Happy hour cocktails were 2 for 1 ($7) and the sunsets were incredible. We woke up super early for a sunrise beach walk/swim, & the water was divine. But go any later, & you'll get attacked by hawkers. I had a massage in the resort spa ($25) which was heaven. We spent a day on a motorbike exploring the beaches & villages around western Lombok which I totally recommend. The people aren't quite as welcoming as the Balinese, however the coastline is so undeveloped which is so nice to see, after coming from Bali. To leave the best to last, we'd love to thank the amazing staff who were just brilliant. We hope to see you again soon :)"

","Excellent place to stay","We stayed 11 nights at the Qunci when we went for a wedding. We only intended to spend a week, but it was so good we extended our stay. We stayed in a garden room upstairs (39) first and it was spacious and quiet. One could hear the distant call to prayer in the early hours but this was not a problem. We were moved to a downstairs garden room (40) when we extended our stay.This was even quieter, as we could not hear the early morning call to prayer from the mosque at all. The beautiful teak furniture and elegant ornaments were totally charming, we were wowed with the decor and the beautiful setting and sunsets. The outdoor indoor bathrooms are awesome.The breakfasts are very good, more than enough for the biggest of appetites. The meals in the restaurants were good. The spa offers great massages and facials, it is very tranquil and the attendants are charming.Beach massages are also on offer and are also good.Location is good, as you can take a 40 minute boat trip from the beach to the Gili islands for snorkelling. This is a good day trip and can be arranged with the guys on the beach in front of the hotel. Ask your guide to point out turtles for you when snorkelling as they can be hard to spot, but there are plenty of them if you get a reasonably early start.Sengiggi is only 5 -10 minutes by taxi, or by scooter if you hire one. Convenient for trinket shopping, and restaurants. The Office in the art market area does fairly good Thai food and is a nice casual local setting on the water. However, if you want to surf, there are really no surf waves on this side of the bay, in May-June. We took a day trip to Gerupak (next to Kuta), and got some good waves from the boat there. There were breaks for confident beginners and advanced at Gerupak and one needs to take a boat out to the breaks. One can surf and boogie board, and you can hire these in Gerupak, especially if you are with a good guide. Snorkelling is also possible on the edge of the reef.We also took a day trip to the waterfalls in Mt Rinjani National Park. This is a long drive (aprox 1 1/2 - 2 hours) however, well worth it. The second waterfall is a must see. And take the swim to behind the waterfall.All in all, Qunci Villas Hotel is the place to stay in Lombok, at least for a couple of nights. It is great value, suberbly relaxing, and beautifully scenic."

We were visually satiated from the beginning, and it just kept getting better and better. The standard of service was nothing short of brilliant and the food was sensational, I hate to say that we became one of those travelers whose majority of dining was done within the resort.Our holiday experience here was so profound we have booked again this year!"

","Nice place to stay...","We stayed for 5 days in Qunci Villas Hotel, a nice place to relax. We had a room for the first night and Qumbang Villa afterwards. The room was very comfortable. Nice view on the pool, partial view on the see, nicely decorated, open-air bathroom. We had a very good night.The day after, we were transferred to the villa located on the hill behind the hotel. Outside: swimming pool and terrace with deckchairs. Groundfloor: lounge, kitchen and bathroom. First floor: one huge bedroom with a terrace, bathroom with a nice view, a dressing room. We really enjoyed our stay in the villa :) The place is really calm, surrounded by a luxuriant vegetation. To get to the Hotel, we walked for a few minutes by going through a village. If needed, you may also ask for a car. The food is delicious. We had our breakfast at the Hotel and also private breakfast at the villa. Staff members came at the time we asked to cook the breakfast in the kitchen. Private lunch and dinner are also possible.For lunch and dinner, we could choose between 2 restaurants: Quali and Qhah restaurants. The first night, we enjoyed the market diner at Quali restaurant that proposed typical indonesian food. The rest of the time, we had diner at the front beach that offers a wonderful view on the see, Agung and Bali. We also had a private romantic diner : flowers, candles, delicious see food. The pool area is very pleasant. Deckchairs with fresh towels, view on the see. It is the first time we could spend the whole day without doing anything :)) Just relaxing... We had nice time with local people who stay on the beach in front of the Hotel. My partner had a surf lesson given by Abdul who also rents body board. We had a relaxing time on the beach with an one hour massage. Ask for Adi who will welcome you with a wonderful smile. It was difficult to cope with everybody... Actually, local people are poor and sales on the beach are their only income. They propose you anything you want :)) Necklace, bracelet, massage, sarong, fruits, tour guide, snorkeling guide, pearls, ... We bought some souvenirs from them. However, some of them do not understand that it is useless to try selling something after we said ""no"" many times. We also had an argument with one of them who made unfair business. It was not possible to discuss with one of them without having everybody coming to us to sell something. So, the day after, we did not go to the beach anymore. We really understand that these sales are necessary for them but we were a little bit disappointed not being able to stay on the beach without being disturb by sellers. Maybe by limiting sales for few hours of the day will allow guests to enjoy the beach peacefully. By the way, we really enjoy the time we had with some of the locals :))We would like to thank the staff for the quality of the service. All of them are very friendly, unintrusive and happy to grant to our requests. After ordering, we may understand that some guests find the waiting time a little bit too long. However, we were on holidays and not bothered by this :))We had an one hour relaxation massage at the spa. My partner booked a zen massage and was disappointed by the excessive energy of the masseur even after having asked for light pressure. The massage was not symetric and part of the body was forgotten. Indeed, one foot was massaged and not the second one, one leg massaged on a certain way the other one on an other way. My partner and I were together in the room. During the massage, my masseur turned the light and the fans down. Few minutes later, my partner's masseur turned the light and the fans on... It was not a zen moment for my partner :( His scalp massage was very painful. It is difficult to stop the masseur during a spa treatment as it would break the process when you try to relax. By comparing with other spa treatment we had in Bali, we cannot say that the spa of the Qunci is professional. Al in all, our stay at Qunci Hotel was really nice and we will be glad to come back..."

","Superb","We had 3 glorious nights at the Qunci Villas as part of our Lombok honeymoon. The resort is truly a divine space to relax, unwind and absorb the rich Indonesian culture. The rooms are stylish and well designed with discrete Indonesian features. The view from our balcony was magnifican and overlooked the tranquil ocean with the sound of the waves providing a serene soundtrack for our stay. The room was tastefully decorated to celebrate our honeymoon upon our arrival!The pools area is a devine, fresh towel always on hand by the attentive, yet unintrusive staff and the spa services were exquisite, the quality of massages insurpassable and the milk / flower bath was incredible. The staff were always warm and friendly and provided an impeccable service.The quality of the food was excellend, the only recommendation I would have for the management would be to increase the vegetarian options on the evening menu and include a 'healthy' breakfast cereal option such as bircher muesli rather than cornflakes and cocopops.The percolated coffee was really good and the sweet, smooth sounds of the likes of Etta James set the scene for the remainder of the day.We would like to have stayed an extra few days at the Qunic and hope to return sometime soon.Thank you to all staff who helped make our honeymoon so incredible and unforgettable!"

","Amazing Villa, Excellent Guest Services!","Me and my boyfriend decided to come here to celebrate his birthday after a friend told us how nice the hotel was, and we had to experience it ourselves to actually believe it.Upon our arrival we were greeted with very friendly security and reception staffs, the TV which we requested via email had already been placed in the room for us. We were booked in the Garden View, however on the second night we witness a few bugs in the room and one dropped on my pillow which freaked me out. Also there was a weasel outside our balcony nibbling on the leftover food. The next day we inform the frontdesk hoping for a roomchange to level 2 and they gave us a free upgrade to the ocean view instead which was really very nice!Dinner there was good too. I wanted to surprise my boyfriend with a cake but it was very last minute so i pretended to go to the toilet and asked one of the staff to just get any dessert that had a slice of cake and put one candle on it. However to my pleasant surprise, their head chef actually whipped up a full round cake for him in 10mins and they all came to sing a HAPPY BIRTHDAY song for him which really made his day, and mine too! Upon payment they said the cake was compliments from the restaurant, which we truely appreciate!Last day our flight was at 8pm so we needed a late check-out and didn't mind paying extra for a few hours. Approached the frontdesk and with the usual helpfulness and smile, they gave us a complimentary late check out as well til 4pm. because of that we were actually able to make a trip to Gili islands and come back on time for lunch and a short rest!This hotel is truely amazing and will definitely recommend my friends and family to go to. No complaints, just full of compliments!"

","A real delight","We loved this place. The grounds are really lovely, great dining options and the pool/deck area overlooking the beach is wonderfully scenic and relaxing. Loved the huevos rancheros for breakfast! One could easily spend the whole day around the pool - a dip in the ocean, a snooze on a comfy sun lounge, a swim in the pool, a margarita watching the sun go down behind Gunung Agung, and gosh, it's time for dinner already! When we arrived we were allocated a room which was a bit close to the renovations underway at the front, so they moved us to another quieter room without fuss. There were also a few mozzies in the bathroom but the staff went out of their way to clear this up for us. Friendly helpful service. For mine, this was the best place we stayed at in Lombok."

","Qunci Villas May Have Been But I'll Never Know","We were raveling in Lombok and stopped by Qunci Villas for a look. The staff at the front gate was somewhat rude and most condescending to me and my Asian wife. After bargaining a bit on the price I decided I really didn't want to stay there. Wrong vibe from the get-go.We went down the road another 100 meters and we're greeted with open arms at Alang Alang which we enjoyed immensely. I had heard good things about Qunci Villas but it just didn't feel right for us.By the way, be sure you stay at one of the hotels north of Sengiggi and stay there. The town is a bit of a dump with pushy touts..."

","A beautiful setting and nice hotel - a few issues though","We stayed three nights in an ocean view room at the far border of the resort, part of the original construction. The service, food and pools were great and the sunsets gorgeous with the Bali volcano as a backdrop. Our room, like many, had an outside bathroom with a few ants but no mosquitoes as another reviewer found. Part of our package took us to motor-less Gili Air island where we had a terrific day of swimming and snorkeling. The hotel beach, however is not ideal for swimming since the coral is too shallow at low tide and the beach mostly disappears at high tide. It is nice for an early morning walk before the beach vendors are out. There are ash trays everywhere and no non-smoking public areas which may bother some as there were a lot of eastern Europeans, most of whom smoked. We came from Bali where we spent a week in a nearly perfect hotel so we were a little disappointed at first with these issues and a somewhat louder AC unit in our room than we were used to having, but after a day, the place did grow on us and we were sorry to leave after 2-1/2 days."

","Great Hotel - Bad management","We stayed in the hotel during 4 days and we loved the view, the restaurant as well as all the facilities. It has an extremelly romantic environment and a very helpfull and polite staff.Although we must say that when we staied there, part of the hotel was under construction (main entrance and close to the pool) and this situation did not allow us to rest enough. The Hotel Management was not sensible to that fact and even that, rent the rooms near the constructions. The cosntructions started every day at 7:00am till 6:00pm, so you can imagine how it is to be on the swimming pool with that noise...We think that at least the Managment should talk about that with us."

","Amazing","Stayed at Qunci for three nights in one of the ocean view rooms. This is a large hotel and they are currently adding more rooms but the ocean view rooms are the best. Initially we were a little surprised that the rooms did not have televisions but there was plenty of activities happening in the hotel to keep us amused. If you are wanting to go to Gili Islands see Abdul and Wan, tour operators on the beach on the right as you leave the hotel. They offer day trips snorkeling/fishing etc at half the price quoted through the hotel."

I am so glad that they chose this hotel to get married in because they could not have chosen a better hotel. We had an ocean view room in one of the best locations. We were right in front of the pool and to the side of the bar/restaurant, but were never disturbed by any noises from either area. There are no words to describe this resort. Everything was simply beautiful!! The pictures on their website do not do this place justice. I am pretty high maintenance when it comes to hotels/resorts and the rooms were perfect! They were spacious and very clean. Our bed faced the door, and we could look out into the pool and ocean while we laid in bed. The rooms do not come with televisions but you can request one from the front desk. The AC worked perfectly and the pools are wonderful and overlooked the beach/ocean. There are tons of lounge chairs with clean towels on each chair. The best part of Qunci is their staff. I must say, that out of all the places and hotels I have ever traveled to, Qunci's staff far surpassed them all. Their customer service is excellent. They always had smiles on their faces with a ""good morning, afternoon, night"" ready on their lips everytime you passed them. One night it rained pretty hard and when we got back to our hotel from dinner, one of the staff members came up to our car, opened our door and had an umbrella waiting for us. Another time, I got stuck inside our room because the lock jammed and the door would not open. I called the front desk and there was a friendly staff member at my door in less than one minute with a key to help me out. My boyfriend lost his camera bag during the wedding and asked a staff member about it. They called our room within 30 minutes to let us know they had it up front for us. Everyone was so friendly and never made you feel like you were imposing if you had a request.The prices of drinks and food prices were pretty reasonable, a little higher than expected for Indonesia but that was to be expected at such a nice hotel. However, there is a restaurant right across Qunci. They became our go-to people for everything. They rent out motorbikes for cheap, have super cheap food and beer, and even arranged our full day driver for us. We would buy a few beers there as well and bring it back to our room and drink them on our patio at nigh (there was no nearby market). There are not many restaurants or things to do outside of the hotel but the central area of Senggigi with all the restaurants are about a 5 minutes drive away and most restaurants will provide free transport from and to your hotel if you call and let them know you need transport and will be dining with them.The only negative thing I can say about Qunci are the mosquitos. I am not sure if they spray but I didn't see any mosquito coils in the room either. The bathroom is outdoors (the toilet and sink area are covered by a ceiling but both my boyfriend and I got eaten alive every time we would use our bathroom. The morning after it rained, we had about 15+ dead mosquitos on our bathroom floor.Also do not get your laundry done with Qunci, they are quite expensive! I got this hotel mixed up with another hotel we were staying at later (Santika Premiere Beach Hotel) and thought they had free daily laundry service. I filled a bag of laundry and had them pick it up. The bill that small bag of dirty clothes came out to be around $45 US dollars. Qunci really was the most perfect place to relax and unwind. We loved every minute of our stay here and are already planning our return a year from now."

","Simply amazing","Spent 4 days at Qunci Villas, simply amazing. I would love to go back.Great staff and friendly and efficient service - one of the best I have experienced. Rooms are very well sized, fantastic outdoor shower and quiet with lots of privacy. Two amazing restaurants with great value food and drinks, mix of traditional Indonesian and Western menu. Lovely cocktails with great Happy Hour deals in the evening. Amazing spa with extensive menu and good value prices.Pool is amazing, with lovely sun beds and surrounding landscaping. Beach is just in front of the pool, with great views beyond. Entertainment on several nights depending on the day - could be traditional Indonesian music and dance, or barbeque night. There is a shop across the road outside the hotel to stock up on bottled water or snacks.Hotel can also arrange for a boat trip to the Gili Islands, quite competitive in pricing.Although the hotel is a little far from the airport (you can arrange for airport pick-up), it's worth the distance!"

","Qun-tastic","In a word ''Sensational'' .No photo shopping here & what you see on there website is pretty much what you get . Perfect place for peace & relaxation . Beautifully appointed rooms & well manicured lush tropical gardens . Ocean view rooms are obviously the pic of the crop but garden view rooms located on eastern side which is older & more established are lovely as well . The staff are all very friendly not to mention attentive & bend over backwards to offer quality fare & service . Found the price of food to be reasonable & cocktail hour or hours value for money .We were after a recharge with good food , wine , sun & surf not to mention laid back vibe & Qunci offered this plus more . Gee i nearly forgot the massage under the bale , looking out to sea for $10.00 per hr .Literally ask for 'Ari' on the beach & this wonderful man will literally pick you up on the beach & take you on your day trip to the Gilli Islands , very professional ."

","Amazing Honeymoom","Firstly my apologies to all at Qunci Villas for not writing a review earlier (we were there October 2011). The only thing I can say is wow! We stayed in Villa Qusia (the villa up the hill from the hotel) for 2 weeks for our honeymoon and even now my husband and I dream of returning. Absolutely everything was perfect from day one. We arrived late on the first night to be greeted by our extremely friendly butler who took the time to give us a welcome drink show us around the multiple buildings. To top this off as it was our honeymoon they had decorated the master bedroom with tealights and had a welcome cake in the room. We were then asked if we would like some thing to eat and he proceeded to arrange dinner from the restaurant to be brought up - can you honestly ask for a better welcome than that! This sums up our entire stay perfectly. The following day we were able to explore the villa in daylight and nothing disappointed, we had an opportunity to meet our personal chef and 3 butlers who remained with us for the entire 2 week stay as they like you to feel completely comfortable with the staff who spend from 7 - 11 catering for your entire needs - you could never accuse the staff of being lazy if they weren't busy serving your meals, supplying you with water, tea & coffee they were cleaning up and ensuring everything is perfect.Later on in the holiday the hotel was served the ultimate challenge - no water! Something like this is the true test of a hotel and they passed with flying colours. They identified the problem before us and were busy finding ways to ensure we were comfortable, ranging from allowing us to use the other villa which was vacant, taking us to a room in the hotel and getting the local fire service to deliver water to fill the tank.I am struggling to put in to words how special this holiday was to us and I trully believe it was due to an amazing concept and exceptional staff - congratulations to a hotel that actually puts its guest first!The only thing I would suggest to the management is the finish in the bedrooms could do with a refresh, don't get me wrong this place is stunning and you have to look hard to find a fault.A special thank you to Made (our chef), Remi (butler), Oni (butler) and Munzir (butler) - sorry if my spelling is incorrect!On our final day after check out we were given the complimentary use of one of the rooms in the main hotel as we had a later flight and the standard of this was also exceptional for the rates usually charged. But I think the most touching part of the holiday was Remi coming to find us to give us a beautiful silver butterfly as a gift to remember our stay by - the little things are priceless!I have promised to return the only shame is I need to save for a while but rest assured when I make it there it will be worth every penny.Thank you to all and if the management do find the time to read this please pass on our thanks to the villa staff, everyone encountered from the cleaners to security may our stay a pleasure."

","Great service in the lovely Qunang villa","We stayed in the Qunang villa, that is beautifully designed as well as very functional : it can fit 6 people. It is an ideal retreat, away from the busy central Sengiggi. The butler will cater for your every need with efficiency from dawn until after dinner. The personal chef is a treat : he will either accomodate the dishes of the hotel restaurants to your taste or cook whatever else you ask. He will bring you to the market if you wish or shop by himself if you prefer use your time time for something else.The benefit of staying in such a villa is that you can enjoy all the infrastructure and services of the hotel (very customer-oriented staff, spa, pool by the sea, restaurants, airport pick-up and drop-off, touring organization...) whenever you want, while being able to stay in a deliciously quiet villa at anytime.The villa is 100m away from the reception lobby but the hotel will drive you by car as often as desired.The hotel is still extending, probably thanks to its success. All the constructions are made with a great modern taste using a lot of wood (many large and amazing benches carved into a single piece of wood). Shared areas are very nice.Note that the garden rooms are a bit packed, yet their areas are good (on our late check out, such a room was complimentary for a last shower just before leaving)"

","Fantastic Accommodation!","LOVED IT! Qunci Villa's were amazing. The rooms were all immaculate and very well presented. We stayed in the Garden View room and were very satisfied. Fantastic value for money. The Pools down on the beach are excellent and there are plenty of lounge chairs. The local sellers that are down the beach are super friendly and love a bit of bargaining and a good chat. The spa was really nice, unfortunately I did not get the time to see the new spa, but the old one was great. Restaurants were really nice and reasonably priced. They have a happy hour between 5 and 7 with two for one cocktails, which is perfect to watch the sunset. Will definitely be back at some stage!"

","Sunsets over Bali and Lapindo Cake","Family of 6 took two rooms one above the other. Lovely stay: Lombok clearly less developed than Bali, no bad thing, gbut Qunci had everything we could want. Snorkelling straight off the beach, excellent food and cocktails, outriggers over to the Gilis next to the hotel, a great surf break and glorious vies of Mt Agung at sunset. Very reasonable pricing for the quality of hotel. oved the Lapindo Cake- oozy chocolate cake named after the Infamous Indonesian mud volcano company. Even the usual touts on the bach were laid back and restrained- ask for Abdul if you want to go surfing."

","Fantastic...","Everything about this hotel is excellent, and the setting is a little bit of paradise.The staff are attentive and very friendly, the rooms are spacious and tastefully designed, the gardens and pools are beautifully landscaped, there is a choice of two restaurants with a good menu selection for both dinner and breakfast.Senggigi is a short taxi trip from the hotel for further dinning and trip options. The hotel is also ideally situated for a day trip to the Gilis. I used a great guide called Eko Suprajitno who I contacted and arranged a trip prior to my holiday via facebook -https://www.facebook.com/home.php?ref=hp#!/ekomangsit. You will see his services recommended through out Trip Advisor reviews.I highly recommended this hotel! :)"

","Satisfying experience","The hotel is very well maintained. During our arrival we just little bit confused because the front desk send us from one reception to another reception, it appears they have 3 seperate receptions desk in different area. There is a renovation too when we stay there, however they keep the noise low and it didn't bother us at all. We rent a motorbike through the hotel and pay fair amount of price (Rp. 65.000/24 hours). We ate lunch in the restaurant and the taste is so-so, not worth the expensive price. Despite the taste, the restaurant is a good place to hangout too while waiting for our room, because we arrived there around 1pm and the check in time is around 2 pm. The staffs are very attentive to our needs. The pool is big compare to any other hotel in Lombok, it's great for a lap swimming. the location is nice, by the beautiful senggigi beach, however if you do not have your own transportation, it will be too far to go anywhere else or to buy food from restaurant nearby outside the hotel. i also would like to thank you for the surprised bday cake from the management."

","I will return","Stayed here after our return from climbing Mt Rinjani. As were here for one night, we opted for the standard rooms at the older wing. On arrival at the vicinity, we were a bit dissapointed as vehicles could not drive into the pathway (this was early April 2012) as works were being done. There was also a lot of building activity at the front of the hotel, within the hotel compound. This was what we saw when we arrived and we had to alight from our bus with our luggage put on the side of the main road.But, were we dissapointed after that? NO! No at all. A security guard was immediately despatched to look after our luggage while other staff members were at hand to lug it all to the reception. Coming into the hotel, one wouldn't notice the construction works at all. Noise was minimal as well. They have done a good job shielding it away. The staff - every one whome we encountered during our brief stay was fantastic. Our entire group was totally thrilled with the place as it was sort of a surprise. We were asked to gather for dinner at the reception at 7.30pm and we were walked to a specially set up table for the 13 of us, for dinner, by the beach. It was so good to see each and every one of our group being so pleased.Breakfast was also good. No buffet but this is actually better. One could choose from one of three places to have breakfast, with the menu being the same. The grounds are so well kept as well. Whatever we requested for from housekeeping came promptly and I would think that nothing is too difficult a request. The 2 pools are also fantastic. The massage by the sea (Rp100,000), the hut which one can climb up (by the pool) and just sit and do nothing..everything was fantastic.The sea was clear but you get the odd rubbish being washed up, although I must add that this is something which the hotel can have no control over.This was my third trip and this was simply the best. Would be back at this place."

","grab a book, cocktail and relax..","you really do not want to leave the pool/beach area. it is that good!The cons: villa is not that private as they are far too close and the pool is small. the beach is very narrow and so only loungers by the pool are of use. Service is fairly poor as there did not seem to be a manager around and the place was run by trainees who kept forgetting our order. although they were trying...we kept on getting woken up in the morning by the school on the other side of the wall. there is nothing within walking distance of the hotel.the Pros: villa was nicely finished, bathroom was great, pool and beach area was stunning, OK snorkelling although the waves were a bit high.Overall good value for money, very very relaxing.."

","Lombok style indulgence","My surfing husband and I have just returned from our Lombok holiday which culminated in a four night stay at Qunci Villas. We chose Qunci initially because of the great reviews and it's location close (but not too close) to Sengiggi and the port to Gili Islands, and because we wanted to end with a little luxury.It lived up to everything we had read. Beautiful decor, immaculate presentation and attention to detail, great choice of dining options and the food was sumptuous - and very cheap (compared to our Aussie restaurant prices and some others in Bali). We chose to dine by the ocean front for breakfasts and for two dinners - very romantic. We were lucky enough to be there for a traditional dance performance (and to participate).We were initially given a pool front room at garden level, but as we wanted to see the surf, the very helpful front counter staff moved us to the perfect room which was upstairs and looked across the infinity pool right at the beach where the waves were breaking. A few small, short breaks were surfable and my husband quickly befriended the local surfers who were happy to share the waves and teach him some Indo surf lingo at the same time!Beach hawkers were entertaining and didn't worry us too much - smile and enjoy the experience and the lovely array of sarongs! They also have to make a living and are very friendly.We walked to Sengiggi and back one day which was very picturesque (5km each way) and another day took a shuttle to the port (RPH 50 each - $5) which was in itself a beautiful drive, and then the public boat to Gili Air (RPH 8 - 80cents) each way. Hired bicycles ($4) and circumnavigated the island, enjoyed lunch at Scallywags, banana lassies at beach bars, snorkelled the brilliant blue, clean water and coral. Dinner that night back at Qunci by candlelight on the beach was something we will always remember. Loved the lights on the surf and watching a local fisherman net his bait fish of an evening... mesmerizing.At the end of our stay, our blue taxi driver took us to the new airport at Praya (1hr 10mins) and only charged us RPH 140 ($14) he spoke brilliant english and we tipped him well.Our entire stay at Qunci was fabulous - perhaps one of the best things was the friendliness and helpfulness of every staff member who went above and beyond on every occasion. Room staff dropped what they were doing and carried our bags (without expecting a tip), while others gave us lots of advise on where to go each day and were genuinly interested in our well-being - always addressing us by our names. Compliments to the management on your excellent staff.Compared to the inflated prices we would have paid in Aus for a 5 star hotel (turn-down service and house-keeping every day) and restaurants like this, we were very, very happy with the final bill.We will be back and bring family next time!"

","Pool + Ocean view + Cocktails, yes please!","We went to Qunci Villas to celebrate our wedding and over all it was a great experience.The Positives: The pool area overlooking the ocean is a stunner! You just want to drink cocktails and enjoy this area as much as you can. Thanks to this area and the pool on our Villa, we didn't leave the Hotel much at all.The staff was very friendly and prompt. They were very personable and they seem to enjoy their work. We read reviews about the trainee program affecting the guests stay, but we actually found the trainees the most friendly and helpful of all and very enthusiastic about the program.I enjoyed a lot the Spa treatment I had and the outdoor bath. The staff was amazing and made sure the experience was unforgettable. We stayed at the Pool Villa, which was great. We loved the design of the outdoor bathroom and enjoyed our pool.We bought DVDs in Ubud, so the staff was prompt to install in our room a TV and a DVD. We felt like home.For our wedding, the wedding planners organized everything and were amazing. Initially I spoke with Scott, the owner, through tripadvisor, who was prompt to refer me to his staff. It was a beautiful memory for us. We had dinner at a private hut with a table and a sofa which was just by the ocean...this was amazing and unforgettable!What Could be Better (and this are all things that can be improve, don't get me wrong):The food honestly was not great and it could be improve to match this gorgeous paradise, we found it inconsistent. What we really liked of the menu were the Oysters, the sandwiches and the french fries. The price could be better.OVERALL, it was great and we would love to come back one day. We were very relaxed after our stay at Qunci's :)."

","Inconsistent","My fiancÃ© and I were excited about our stay at Qunci which we hoped would be the perfect end to a very special holiday.The website was impressive, as were the reviews, so we didn't think twice about looking around and booked an Ocean View villa.First off, make no mistake: this place is beautiful. It's immaculate and feels very exclusive and luxurious. Our room was lovely, the staff were friendly and well intentioned and the location could not have been better.That said, the longer we stayed the more inconsistencies we came across. There was a lot of staff training going on which we fully appreciate however there didn't seem to be any support in place to ensure our stay wasn't affected, eg the 1.5 hour wait for an engineer to fix our broken patio door on first night.Considering the hype, the food is really hit and miss - we sent back more meals than we care to mention (we really aren't fussy) but we at least expected the fish to be well cooked! Upon one food complaint the waiter told us he understood but it was due to the chef experimenting with new dishes and they welcomed our feedback (not exactly what you want to hear at their prices!!).Prayers disturbed our sleep significantly but as with all these reviews there isn't much that can be done with that we suppose. I think it needs to be mentioned at some point, ideally booking, to give guests a fair chance to make an informed decision.Finally, perhaps controversially, this place draws in the families.no offence and dont get us wrong, we don't hate children, but when your forking out for a stay here and sipping you London-priced cocktail while watching the sun go down in one of the most beautiful islands in the world, you hardly expect that to be disturbed by children running up and down behind you, calling to each other, crying, whatever. The place seems to market itself to romantic breaks and honeymooners but unfortunately, in our minds at least, that kind of break is simply impossible with children of a certain age dominating communal areas such as the pool. Perhaps an age restriction is a compromise?Ps unfortunately we won't be back to Lombok for awhile (world's a big place to explore!) but this review is purely to inform future guests and isn't intended to draw a sharp response from the management as we have seen on other slightly negative reviews, thank you."

","Outstanding!!","Qunci villa is one of a brilliant idea around Senggigi. It's a perfect combination between a place with quiet neighborhood, outstanding service quality, friendly staff and last but not least was tasteful food especially the breakfast. We stayed here for 5 nights at one of the ocean view room, my two kids are loved the room and it's just one step far from the swimming pool. I would like to thank the kitchen staff for their kindness to serve special food for my kids out of the menus. One more thing that cannot be forgotten is when one of my kid got fever, the guy from front office helping me to get drug fever from Senggigi immediately. I'm not very good with people names but one thing I noticed that all the Qunci staff are honest and truly care with their guest, another rare combination nowadays.The beach hawker are nice people even though you're not buying their stuff, they can be a friend and reliable source to get more info about the location. We hired a boat to gili's and we do really enjoy this trip, my kids are very pleased playing on the white sandy beach at Gili Air. Gili islands is an amazing place, with plenty eateries, I've seen no cars, no motorcycle, it's a perfect place to spend a holiday though. The boatman charge me with reasonable price (idr 550k) but it's worth nothing compare to his service and at the end of the trip I gave him extra payment. I'm not agree with people saying that price is over paid, at end of the day he only took roughly idr150k home after the fuel, paying the boat owner, boat association, etc etc..most of time still he has to pay for his lunch when waiting his customer relaxing. So that kind of money is barely enough to make a living and not every day he got a customer.There are many wonderful things that I want to share here but this report become a boring journal at the end..bottom line this was a precious vacation I ever had and I'm sure to comeback here again some other time. Thank you Qunci for making my holiday meaningful."

","Honeymoon","Just got back from our honeymoon. 4 days 3 nights at Qumbang villa which is the 1 bedroom private villa on the hill away from the main hotel. Let me just say this, if you want a romantic place to spend with your wife or partner, look no further. Words cannot describe how amazing this place is. It has a lovely pool of its own, loads of comfortable daybeds to lay on, and the bedroom itself is incredibly luxurious. All the staff members were cheerful and ready to help with anything. The level of service is outstanding. The daily breakfast is served in your villa. Two staff come at a time specified by you and prepare it fresh and serve it. The dinner by the beach (also a apt of the honeymoon package) was also brilliant. Tasty and romantic.As a really nice touch at the end, the staff arranged a free ride back to the airport at no cost.We will definitely be going back there."

","Charming Boutique Villas","We stayed here for a quick 3 night/3 day get away in September 2011. Qunci Villas is a charming little boutique hotel that has great service. We stayed in a second floor basic villa and were quite pleased with the room, especially the beautiful half-open air bathroom and large balcony with daybed for reading/relaxing. The breakfast is really nice and worth enjoying by the beach or on your balcony. We tried to book Villa 23 (facing the Ocean) but it was not available. It would have been nice to stay there.The spa is fantastic, with relatively good prices. The quality of service is excellent and the ambiance is very relaxing.We took a day trip to the Gili Islands for snorkeling (for IDR 550,000 - probably paid too much). We were given the guy's name and phone number by a friend, but there are plenty of boats if you walk down the beach to the right of the resort. I highly recommend a day trip to Gili, or even longer if you want to dive. One night we went into Semanggi for dinner. There are many restaurant options there.We wouldn't have stayed any longer than three nights but really enjoyed out time there. Next time we go to Lombok we plan to do a two-night hike of Renjani, which we've been told is amazing.In October the domestic airport was still open and it was a short 30 minute drive Qunci Villas. Now travelers need to plan on a longer drive to the International Airport so it's worth keeping that in mind."

","Great place in Lombok!","We just returned from a very relaxing 5 day trip to Lombok and had a great stay in Qunci Villas. We liked our partial ocean view spacious room with extra bed for our son (16) and nice verandah, close but no too close to restaurant pool and beach.What makes Qunci truly amazing is the staff, they are very friendly, pleasant, helpful and professional. The property is well designed, natural colours and well lay out along the beachfront and maintenance standards are high also.Our only issue was the wifi, that was not working well this week. The issue was resolved amicably and the manager Mrs Wiwit promised an upgrade taking place shortly. Happy hour sunsets, from your lounge chair near the rolling waves and jumping surfers, facing Bali Gunung Agung vulcanoe is unforgettable. We miss it already!Rob Caroline Jeroen"

","Okay","This review is mainly for the Qunci villas across the road from the main hotel.1. The villas are a five minute walk to the hotel.2. The employees are fabulous.3. The art and wood are gorgeous but other parts are beginning to look worn.4. The villas are quiet noisy -- lots of people, animals, and I respect the call to prayer, but this one is the loudest I've experienced. (I've lived in Indonesia for three years). Perhaps the rooms in the hotel area are more quiet. 5. BYOP-- bring your own pillow.6. Because the ceilings in the villas are high and the rooms are huge, it doesn't stay cool at night. There are AC issues.7. There are fabulous restaurants in town. Eat at those.8. The wifi worked very well.The price was not equal to the stay in the villas."

We were really wowed at arrival though it took longer than we thought to reach there (we were traveling from Singapore)We were there for a week with our 2 year old and we loved it. We stayed in the newest development and were not disappointed.Yes you can always find some things that are not perfect but overall we really liked it (and we will be writing about these little things that can make a difference to Qunci Villas itself).The room was a villa with ocean view with an opened air shower.It was very clean and the wood cotbed for our son was very nice.The possibility of having our meals on our terrace overlooking the ocean in the evenings while our son was asleep made a HUGE difference.The staff at Qunci was nice though we found the english-level can be improved.About the hawkers on the beach, i would like to say that they're a bit of a disturbance as you want to swim or have a meal with a view of the ocean, and you've got a bunch of guys staring at you for lengthy periods of time. No matter how nicely you are to them and even if you buy once from them, they keep on coming back. Yes they're trying to make a living, but you came to relax and nothing else. I feel this is something that should be addressed by Qunci, especially because of the fact that they stay for all days long around. If it was just passing by, I wouldn't mind.Apart from that, we really loved everything, even when it was raining, the landscape is beautiful. Internet doesn't work very well but that wasn't too much of an issue.The food was fine, would have liked more choice. It was nice to be able to order from the chef directly for our son though the kids menu is great. Don't order the cocktails, they were very bad!The swimming pools are fantastic but the overall environment is not very toddler-friendly. Our son fell twice on the marble and got hurt. He could fall anywhere but the angles of the marbles stairs are pretty sharp.The beach is not that great considering that we couldn't go into the ocean, the waves are way too powerful to have your child in there. He got swiped by the waves twice while we were holding him and it was hard pulling him back. The sand is black and the width of the sand area small so not very convenient to play. Best to stick to the swimming pool.We had a memorable holiday and would definitely come back. Thank you Qunci for a beautiful family holiday."

","Perfect","I loved everything about this place; friendly staff, good to excellent quality food and drinks, appealing architecture and beautiful rooms (though the paintings and their placement were not my taste), great location, cleanliness and attention to details, beautiful natural stone pools, free wifi, beach-facing seating for happy-hour drinks and dinner while watching sunset over Bali in the distance, sea with good surf at the doorstep etc. etc. Great value for money. Unrestricted recommendation for couples, friends, solo travelers and even families with little children. However, those who are dependent on TV... there is none. Also, while the Wifi connection is fast if you have a sufficiently strong signal, I had problems connecting in areas outside the shared facilities. This could however have had something to do with my MacBook Air and the OS X it runs on as I have regularly experienced similar problems in other places."

","Still the best!","Returned to Qunci a few weeks back - bigger than ever with more wonderful rooms and staff. Gorgeous spot for rest and relaxation. Improvements include wifi in all rooms (double check). And ya know what - the first place I have stayed in for years where the mini-bar prices are reasonable unlike so many places at Qunci it is a guest service and not a rip-off."

","My favourite place-ever - but, a little-but!","I recently stayed at Qunci for the second time - and it confirmed to me that it is one of the most beautiful places on this earth. I treasured every moment whilst there and continue to do so now that I have returned to ""the real world"" of making a living. As ever, the staff at Qunci are always smiling and helpful - some even remembered me from my last visit with my husband (2 years ago). I stayed in room 28 this time, and if you don't mind the sound of the surf at night, this is the perfect room (please keep this a secret). I am a keen sunset watcher and as it happens ""Happy Hour"" technician, (BUT) would like to perhaps suggest that both the cocktail menu (and consistency) be improved (found it very boring - and staff do need to impress a little more in this area) - I am lucky enough to be returning in Sept this year, so will see if my wish has come true - Hence - Perfection!!!"

","Class Act","Great hotel, beautifully presented, gardens stunning-day & night, staff amazing, brilliant food. What more could you need for a good holiday! Have stayed in many similar class hotels and this the first time we have not experienced the early morning ""bun fling"" for beds by pool/beach. Anytime of the day you could get one. And hotel was busy too.Our room was a garden view but the outdoor shower was covered due to the building work behind for new hotel. This we totally understand and was needed but it did ruin the effect a little bit. Building work was on going and initially did not notice it but came to head prior to the opening day/night of new hotel, restaurant and preparation for the owner arriving. Thankfully next day it quietened down.Had a few treatments at the spa, fantastic too.Hawkers on beach are there all day but nice people just trying to make a living.It's definitely is a hotel we will consider returning to. Shames it's so far from the UK! One thing that really stood out were the staff themselves. Engaging, attentive and gave the impression they were proud to work at The Qunci. Well done to all involved and thank you!"

","A Little Piece of Heaven","We could remember as if it was just yesterday. Bali was an amazing cultural experience and could be sensory overwhelming for those who never been there before. So I was determined to search for a villa, boutique style hotel to unwind and did nothing but that. I discovered the Qunci Villas by accident and took a chance. I was glad I took it because everyone was overly impressed and had a wonderful 2-night stay! It was beautiful, modern, chic, super private, and right at the ocean. Its location is quite secluded so prepare to take taxi everywhere. The breakfast overlooking the ocean at the open-air restaurant was amazing. Infiniti pool was totally sublime. Villas were heavenly and clean. We found out later on that itâs also gay-friendly. Thank you for wonderful memories and please keep up the great property + services, Qunci Villas!"

","Amazing Hotel!!","My partner and I recently stayed in a pool villa at Qunci Pool Villas. We were blown away by this hotel.The room decor was light,airy and very clean as was our own pool. The staff were incredibly friendly and engaging. We had many wonderful interactions with the staff, learning their language and teaching them some of our "" Aussie slang"". Nothing was ever a problem and we loved their ""can do"" attitude. Especially attentive was Nova on the front desk.The hotel is well set out and has some amazing artwork both inside and outside. We had high expectations after having stayed at some wonderful hotels in Bali, Qunci did not disappoint but in fact surpassed our expectations. This hotel is a number one stop for a relaxing and indulgent holiday.Last but not least the food, both restaurants were fantastic with a lot of variety on offer. My partner had the best ""Beef Rendang"" here that he has ever tasted and that is a big call.Hats off to Qunci Villas, we will be back!!"

","Service, attention to detail and value that's hard to match","I can't say enough about the amazing quality of service, beautiful layout and hotel decor, attention to detail from both staff and resort or the value that you get from staying at Qunci Villas. This was a honeymoon destination so expectations were reasonably high, but QV blew all those out of the water as it was an exceptional place to stay for so many reasons. We are not the type of people to stay in ""posh"" resorts (especially due to our modest budget), but QV excels in this area too, giving you much more than you'd expect from rooms at this price (our Garden Room price being the more than we'd pay for a tiny cubical Airporter Hotel room in Australia!). From turn-down service to beachside dining to rainfall-style private outdoor garden shower to pristine garden landscaping to original and delicious 5-star restaurant offerings at cafe prices to warm and genuine staff service at every turn, Qunci is one of the best hotel experiences I've had, especially for the price. Can't recommend it highly enough!"

","awesome, a hidden treasure!","We just returned from our holidays in Qunci Villas hotel.More than advisable. It is sold in some catalogs as a tourist class hotel but for us that was more than top class. Very friendly staff from the reception to the restaurant (Ayu, Sule...). Our ocean facing room was perfect. If I must say something...I was missing a couple of kymonos in the bathroom. Delicious food at very affordable rates, romantic dinners with candles on the beach. We found rain during 3 days but we enjoyed this hotel eventhough. Nice sunset in clear days with the balinese Agung volcano in front of our eyes. The landscape is terrific but no great activities to do in Lombok except going for snorkel to Gili Islands, so this hotel is perfect for just relaxing and enjoying the hotel itself. Friendly masseuses on the beach, we had a great time. I will recommend it to my clients in the travel agency, no doubt !"

","wow","Stayed at the Qunci Pool Villas in February'12 and loved it very much. The hotel is amazing, it is so clean and the gardens and grounds are immaculate. The staff are very polite and friendly and will go to great lengths to ensure your stay is memorable. we went to the spa during our stay and the girls there are so professional and really know what they're doing as we enjoyed our massages very much and would definitely go back, it was so relaxing. The restaurant is also very nice no need to go looking anywhere else for great food. Even though the hotel has some construction going on with the new wing being added, it did not interfere with our stay at all, we look forward to returning to Qunci in the near future. Thank You"

","Good spot to relax, do spa and good quality Indonesian food!","The location is great if you are looking for a rest at the resort, you would have to take a taxi to go to singgigi center which is approximately 15 min ride. Therefore there is not much to see just outside of the resort you would always need a car or a boat. Because of that you have not much choice than to eat at the resort itself, the food is very good but pricy. Spa is exceptionally good and really worth trying! It's amazing how many personnel are working at the resort ;we thought there was more stuff thank guests. We also asked the staff to organize the boat to Gili air,they did it but the price was 400.000 with the fast boat (a little expensive if you compare with other companies).The rooms are spacious and very clean which is very nice,although the airco is quite old and loud, for the price of the room I would expect newer airco. Breakfast is good but it's not a lot what you get, so you"" ll be surely hungry by lunch. A very big plus is very nice and spacious rain shower!"

","Surpassed all my expectations.","Before going to Qunci Villas, I was reading through the reviews here. I was expecting a lot of noise pollution from the construction work going on next door, as well as being harassed by the beach hawkers, but these were very mild annoyances. In fact, I didn't notice any noise at all until I walked by the beach and saw the construction site. My room was a partial ocean view, #39, which is away from the pool & restaurant area so the construction work was not audible.The beach hawkers did not shout or harass us, perhaps because we looked local and could speak some Indonesian. It's best to just ignore them or decline politely. After all, the beach is actually a public area and they have a right to make a living there.The restaurant had a special Valentine's day set menu (with VERY romantic tables and lamps set up, and an acoustic band) but we decided to go for the a la carte menu instead. Everything was delicious. But the best part is BREAKFAST. They have yummy set breakfast menus to choose from, which they can bring up to your room at no extra cost. We had ours on the room balcony and it felt very luxurious. The service feels 5-star although I expected this to be a 4-star hotel. All the staff at reception, spa and restaurant were very warm and friendly. They also went out of their way to do the little things. For instance, I had two local friends who dropped us off at the hotel, and they were also given the welcome drinks. They also sent us umbrellas to the rooms promptly when we called up the reception during the heavy rain."

","Going the Extra Mile","Although there was on-going construction just beside the villa, the service exceeded our expectations by far. The staff are friendly, approachable and very helpful. What impressed us the most was the impeccable service unlike any other. We had bought take out food from the main town, Sengiggi and by the time we had decided to eat it at Qunci Villa by the pool, it was cold. We requested for the restaurant staff to microwave the food. Surprisingly, the staff came back with not only the food heated, but had also beautifully plated the food as though it was being served like their own dish made fresh by the in-house restaurant. They also gave us napkins and utensils! We felt really bad but heartily chomped our Ayam Taliwang (signature local dish in Lombok)!While having the occasional laze by the pool side, facing the beautiful Mangsit beach, the staff would come over with refreshingly cold face towels, fruit sticks, and even a complimentary shoulder massage! (If you're lucky to see the 2 trainee masseuses walking around )The 5-star treatment we received made the Lombok experience unforgettable. We are sure to return some day.Thank you to Widi and your amazing team! Keep up the good work!"

","most beautiful sunset and garden","Luckily after a heavy rain when we arrived, staff friendliness and beauty of the well maintained gardens filled with local plants welcomed us. Our room was the type of partial ocean and garden view, very spacious, outdoor bathroom, minimalist and very natural, spacious veranda treat the wet day. We decided to have dinner in the room, wow .. all the food is delicious, the right ingredients were perfect for my Asian taste and my boyfriend's American taste. Next 2 days were surprisingly sunny, we started with the yummie breakfast and beautiful presentation at the restaurant right next to the swimming pool and beach. Staff are always ready to help. Seemed that souvenir hawkers have been filtered out by hotel and security staff always looks on guard but still relaxed and very friendly, so it made the whole Qunci Villas stay as the starter of our very romantic and relaxing vacation. Sunset was the most beautiful moment we had and massage for couple at Kamboja Spa was really relaxing. We love the lemon grass iced tea and ginger hot tea. We even asked restaurant to serve the same to our room. Oh..and after 2 hours checked out from hotel, hotel staff called us many times to apologize, because there is an error count that we actually have payed more than it was. Fortunate that we havent gone to Gili Trawangan. We really appreciate it. We hope that after the renovation, we could go back there to enjoy it. Hey, we actually stopped by for lunch after 5 days in Gili, mmh..mmh..yum."

","Construction noise dominants and impeeds holiday","WARNING - there is major construction noise from 7:30AM until after 10PM regularly until April. This construction will carry on till the end of march if not late April. Do not stay here if you want peace quiet and tranquillity in those months. After that date this is an awesome place. Our holiday was trashed by the noise as Qunci proceeds to build its third hotel on the same stretch of beach. The reality is that this cosy, well priced, beautifully located hotel can offer a 5 star experience. It is rich with many great features, its not a 5star hotel, probably a 4, but it can nail it and deliver something special. For me though I was not informed of the construction noise. when I arrived I was told it would start at 9am and complete at 5pm, it carried on throughout breakfast and through dinner ever day. I was compensated, I got one free meal ($30) which is not great when you spend close on $1000 for your entire stay.The Good Bit - Enough of the noise pollution story though, if you are coming or thinking of coming after April then here is what you can expect.Rooms - good sized with outdoor showers, balconies with views if you want. All rooms have a private balcony, upstairs ones offer some views, over the pool, to the sea. We chose one that had a great outlook as long as you do not mind looking past the pool. Rooms are sparse (great if you have kids) and have adequate amenities. They are not amazing, mind you for the price they are perfect.Service â hit and miss frankly. Sometimes a request would be met immediately, other times three conversations were required. No doubt the tea were friendly and worked to deliver a great experience â perhaps training and skills developing would assist in the tardiness of some request â who waits 15 minutes for a glass of water!Food â was good, seafood definitely was better. Breakfast offers a choice of set menus which is good â the bread is not high quality and the milk is long life. Coffee and tea are decent, not incredible. Overall I felt we enjoyed our meals, albeit not enthralled. Cocktail Time â from 5 till 7 daily is a two for one special on most drinks â seriously a very cool thing. Sunsets are nothing short of sensational and to while it away with a great drink, well seriously you have made my day if you manage that! Atmosphere â Qunci sits on a lovely bit of beach, grey volcanic sand, a reef, tranquil warm waters, great palm trees, high quality buildings and all in all is pretty darn perfect. I will be back to experience it again. Location â not far from sengigi, on a great beach. Go for a walk and you can wonder into Puri Mas (nearby hotel) for a lunch or dinner, although do not take kids they escorted me from the building as I brought tow kids, can ya believe it. But the beach is great, go for a stroll. Or catch a boat and head over to the giliâs for a day trip â uber coolBeach hawkers â ok these fellas are annoying, not only do they come into the hotel grounds (if only by a few inches) they sit their yelling at you all day. The fact that they say that they pay qunci a commission for their massages does not delight me. I got two massages on the beach cabana BUT I had to listen to all the hawkers talk to me and try and sell me stuff I do not want during the massageâ¦hmmm not good. Lose the hawkers Qunci, or better still as they need to eat, teach them how to behave. Trust me if they do not yell, present a decent image be patient and more people will buy!Value â over all the money is about right, somethingâs are too much money, other things are well priced. Conclusion: What a great place. Yes a few things are bad at the moment, wait till late April and go. My main concern here is that I am not convinced that Qunci cares for its clients enough. They have everything in place and the courtesy of client care is left wanting in view of construction noise and hawkers.Best â atmosphere and cocktail hourWorst â lack of concern for clients. Qunci is more concerned with completing its construction than ensuring its current clients are happyGo Again: I am, booked again in September â please Qunci fix the annoyances and deliver what you can, a very special experience"

Extremely helpful and friendly staff, beautiful landscaped gardens, spacious and comfortably hotel rooms, relaxing massage and stunning scenery especially at sunset across the horizon to Bali. The food and cocktails weren't half bad either! The only downsides were the construction dust and noise from next door (Qunci development) and the awakening for prayer by the nearby mosque at 4am."

","Amazing!!","We stayed for 5 nights during January and it was nothing short of incredible! We were met at the airport by a driver; Aziz (who also takes tours organised through the hotel), he was very knowledgeable and given more time, we would have booked a tour with this man through reception. Welcome drinks on arrival was lovely.Our room, a partial ocean view, was beautiful... Lovely big bed, nice veranda with a day bed, and the open air bathroom was a bit of a novelty... We were impressed with the food in the restaurant, the price was reasonable, however the serving sizes were a little on the small size.The upkeep and presentation of the hotel was exceptional... never a leaf out of place. The pool was beautiful, and on 2 occasions, the staff decorated the surrounds of the pool/restaurant for special occasions (Chinese New Year) which was really lovely. I wish I was able to see one of Qunci's famous sunsets over Bali...however weather did not permit!I guess the thing that most defines Qunci in its excellence is its staff. The staff working at Qunci are all so lovely, friendly, helpful and happy! On numerous occasions these wonderful people went above and beyond for us, be it helping with transport, booking tours or tracking down doctors! I'd like to mention Anie who works on reception: Anie was so helpful when my partner had a medical dilemma. She tracked down Lombok's best doctor and check on us right until the dilemma was sorted! Thanks Anie- You are amazing!One thing which I wish we had of made more use of was the SPA... The BEST facial I have ever had, and I indulge quite often! The new hotel should be great when its finished, it looks great already! We did not have any disturbance from the building whilst staying.All in all, Qunci is AMAZING! I really think twice before telling people about this place, as it is too special to want to share with everyone! :) Thanks, and we will be back!"

","Awesome hotel - great value","We have stayed at Qunci Pool Villas Hotel (not the older hotel, which is just a few doors down) two times and each time we loved the experience. The rooms are cute and the bathrooms are open under the sky. The infinity pool overlooks the ocean and it remains one of our favorite places from which to look out into the sea. The staff is courteous, helpful, and attentive. They often greet us by our names at breakfast. We have been to Qunci Pool Villas Hotel as a couple and as a family with our four month old baby and both times we found that it exceeded our expectations. We have lived in Singapore for five years and I lived in Indonesia for three years previously and there is no other hotel that we would more highly recommend, especially given the reasonable price. The restaurant is fantastic. Our only recommendation to the owner (since we know he reads these comments) is to provide refillable water jugs to help reduce the amount of bottled water guests consume."

","Lovely boutique hotel in Lombok","We stayed in an Ocean View Room (number 5) for 2 nights recently during our Gili/ Lombok pacakge trip and we were delighted with our room and the hotel in general. Originally wanted to stay in the sister hotel 2 doors down but we were not disappointed!Our ocean view room had a lovely terrace/ balcony which was lovely to hang out on when the heavens opened! The WIFI connection worked great from our room but works best in the Bar/ Restaurant and Pool areaThe room was spacious and comfortable - no TV but that didnt really bother us as it was nice to have a TV free room for a change. I understand that a TV is available on request.Great shower room and aircon was available and not too noisy.Beautiful gardens and lovely pool area with easy access to the beach. An excellent spot to watch the local surfers. We dined a few times at the restuarant and were very pleased with the quality of food which was fusion indonesia and western, the cost was very reasonable too! There is daily happy hour both in this and its sister hotel. The staff were all very friendly and attentive.The only mini gripes I would have is that their were building works happening next door - it didnt bother us too much but I can see how others might be annoyed by it.. The building works will make another hotel from the same company which will join Quinci Villa Hotel and its sister hotel Quinci Pool Villas, making 3 very nice boutiquey hotels. Another small gripe were the hawkers on the beach who woulf hover around the beach entrance to the hotel and try to get your attention to buy their wares. Generally if you ignore them or just say no, they will leave you alone so it wasnt a big problem for us as these types of sellers are generally everywhere in Lombok.I defintaly recommend this hotel and its sister (and pending new hotel inbetween) to any visitors to Lombok :)"

","Peace and relaxation.","Overall the villas were as promised in the photos you see in their website. Its a good place to stay. The garden villas (i stayed at top floor for more privacy) are spacious and comfortable. Only bad thing is their bathrooms are too dim but i can live with it. This is a no-tv kind of room. The breakfast is pretty good too and you eat by the beach. The beach outside this hotel is a black sand beach so if you are the kind that likes white sand, this is not for you. Sadly i did not notice the monsoon season so the waves were stronger than i am comfortable with. But the pool is nice and windy. The staff were excellent as they came by with a cool towel and fruit skewers. We hopped over to a nearby island called Gili Trawangan (you should not miss this). Boat details attached in the photos i posted. Overall Lombok is a very very quiet place. Nearest Sengigi town has only one row of shops and restaurants. Enjoy!!"

","Awesome Resort","I stayed at Qunci Pool Villas for 3 nights in January 2012 and it was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! We stayed at three different rooms: garden view, pool villa, and ocean view. The garden view room wasn't that good. The balcony was blocked by plants, so we decided to move to the pool villa (Qinggress, if not mistaken). The Villa was SO NICE! Ocean view was also good. We had a great view of the sea and the nearby swimming pool.The staffs were so welcoming and well-trained. Food was wonderful. We only went out for meals twice during our days in Lombok, and we spent the rest of meals at the hotel. I strongly recommend this hotel to anyone who's traveling to Lombok. It would make your holiday fabulous. Just a small suggestion: the fruit the hotel served wasn't very fresh, and the locks to 2 of the rooms we stayed were hard to use."

","Amazing","We stayed 4 heavenly nights at qunci pool vilas. This hotel is the best I have ever stayed in. The staff are amazing- friendly, professional, helpful but most of all they seem to genuinely enjoy their job. We stayed in an ocean view villa which had an awesome open air shower, king bed and two day beds. The ocean was less than 10 meters from our balcony. The qunci restaurants serve excellent food both eastern and western. I would recommend the ""pagi pagi"" for breakfast. The staff often bring around complimentary food such as fruit skewers if you are in the pool area. Sengiggi is a 3 minute cab ride away and is awash with restaurants, warungs and all things indonesian. It is a friendly, relaxed town that you can freely wander about without being hassled. We had an absolutely amazing stay at qunci and did not want to leave. This has to be the best kept secret in Lombok. We will definitely be back."

","Excellent!","We stayed at Qunci one week around New Year. What can I say. I still think about this beautiful hotel every day. Words can't really describe it. You will have to go and experience it. The whole layout and decoration of the hotel is just stunning. At least a few times a day I would just have to stop, look around and take it all in. The rooms are also very nice and the food in the restaurants is really good!But the best thing about Qunci is the staff though. exceptionally friendly and willing to do anything to make your stay a memorable one. It really brought a tear to our eyes when we had to go! Thanks for everything!We stayed in Qunci Villas (the smallest hotel) and had a room closest to the Mosque. If you are a light sleeper I would recommend staying at the pool villas, which are further away. The mosque is very loud in the morning. So we were up from 4.30 in the morning most of the time. Our 13 year old daughter slept through everything every single night so I guess it's not a big problem for everyone. The hawkers on the beach are addressed as a problem by some people but if you are friendly with them it really can be fun. They are trying to make a living after all. If you buy a few things from some hawkers and just have a laugh with the rest, you'll be fine. At least that's what we experienced. Our daughter learned to surf in front of the hotel. The 'surf school' is right beside the hotel. The instructors are incredibly friendly and fun. we can really recommend it. The only regret we have is not making use of the spa more often. We had a massage just before we had to check out of our room and it was the best massage we EVER had (and we had quite a few)!!!!! Lovely staff too and really enjoyed the ginger tea. This really is a must-do!We will definately try to come back to Qunci again. It was one of the best holidays we ever had."

After days of hard partying, Qunci Villa is the perfect choice for beautiful closure for our Lombok trip. I stayed in the Ocean View room, and I couldn't ask for more beautiful view. Looking from the window of our room is the ocean (d'uh) and the infinity pool. Room was very pretty, artsy and the cleanliness was immaculate.The pool side was perfect for sunbathing, and when I was there I got complimentary 5 minutes massage from the spa. The restaurant was pretty nice.Probably suit better for honeymooners and couples tho.I wish I stayed longer at this villa, will definitely choose this villa again when I go back to Lombok."

","Without fault","My husband and two children aged 14 and 10 (boys) stayed at Qunci Hotel Ocean View Room as part of my 50th birthday celebrations. This was our first overseas holiday together. We were so impressed with the detail in every aspect of the facility.The gardens are immaculate, and are attended constantly by a friendly gardening team making sure they are looking 100%. The attention to detail is so impressive. The rooms are stylish - the bedding luxurious, the open air bathroom exquisite, the front verandah furnished with a day bed and beautiful leather and hardwood chairs and coffee table. Each evening beds are folded down, mosquito repellant sprayed and electric mosquito unit plugged in.Shampoo and conditioner are supplied in little ceramic jugs, white fluffy towels adorned with frangipani flowers.We were very happy not to have a TV in our room or access to a DVD - we were away from home and wanted to enjoy the ambience that Qunci had to offer. Being a football Premier League family my husband could always go to the office and use the computer there to keep up with the goings on of English Premier League!We arrived at Lombok via a small boat from Gili Trawangan. We were met by a lovely driver and air conditioned new Toyota 4WD. The drive to the hotel was very pleasant and it was lovely to be offered fresh towels and a fruit punch on arrival. Our 10 year old said it was the best drink he had tasted.We languished around the pool and ordered cocktails at cocktail hour. The pool is beautiful and blends in with the ocean, and in the background is Bali and Mt Kintimani. Our 14 year old did a bit of surfing out the front while we swam in the pool.We wasted no time booking of an hour massage by a lovely lady on the beach for a cost of $10 an hour. Pure pleasure. The hotel has a large day bed by the pool and the ladies are allowed to use this space, courtesy of the hotel. I agree with the owner, (re previous comments) locals have a right to make a living and I did not find the sellers overpowering at all. In fact, a polite 'no' was all that was needed.We ate at the hotel and again the attention to detail was exemplary. Food fantastic and prices reasonable. Choice of three or four breakfasts. I had an opportunity of introducing myself to the owner to express our delight with the hotel. He was more than happy to take the time to listen to me ramble on about how delighted we were, and the reason why we were at Qunci. We ate at the hotel that night and come dessert the staff presented me with a birthday cake and a rendition of 'Happy Birthday'! It was lovely.We also used the spa next door at the Pool Villas. My 10 year old delighted in a coffee and chocolate body scrub and my older son and I had a wonderful facial. Pure heaven. The facilities around the pool, the furniture, lighting, use of wood and stone - everything is exquisite.I would recommend either Quinci complex to anyone wanting a relaxing holiday where you are made to feel special. Whether a honeymoon, a family holiday, a group of friends.... Qunci is exceptional. It is an oasis from the day to day trappings of life. The staff, management and owners should be highly commended for their efforts and service.As for the building construction next door - this did not bother us at all, and the noise was minimal if nothing at all. We even received a letter a couple of months before we left home that this construction was taking place which I thought was insightful and professional customer service.Communicate with the staff and I am sure they will go out of their way to please.Thank you Qunci for a remarkable experience - we are starting to fill our 'holiday money box once again'."

","Really Excellent Boutique resort on Lombok","Stayed at quinci villas in december just before new year. It is a fantastic place. The rooms are very nice and the grounds immaculate . The food is also very good and not unreasonably priced. most of all , though, the staff are excellent - very friendly and very polite . This place is one of the best on the island with a true boutique feel to it. it is not too far from sengigi - about $2 in a taxi where there are bars, shops and nightlife. quinci villas are highly recommended (note if you want a TV in room you should request in advance)"

","Paradise found","What an amazing place! Beautifully manicured and maintained surroundings. Clearly a lot of attention is paid to the details. Relaxed atmosphere. Nice minimalistically furnished rooms with great semi-open bathrooms. We had Qingrass with its own pool - well worth the extra cost. Breakfasts were great (interesting variations never boring) and dinners in both Pool Villas and neighbouring hotel restaurants were faultless - in fact some dishes amongst the best eaten anywhere. What makes this small resort truly great is probably its staff. All exceptionally friendly yet professional and helpful. The only downside was perhaps the aloofness of the omni-present ownership/senior management - possibly to conscious policy of remaining in the background?."

","Lovely, relaxing, low key, beautiful","We stayed at Qunici Villas early last year and loved the low key ambience, the attentive staff and the gorgeous pool. We were in one of the villa out the back, which were very nice, but probably better off staying in the slightly cheaper ""hotel rooms"" in the front as they have the better view. All in all a great place for a week of total relaxation far from the Bali rat race...."

","Great place - would go again","We stayed 6 nights in early December. This place is heaven. We had a pool villas but really with all the pools (once the finish the new part of the resort) there would be no need for a private one. The new part will be open in March. There is very little construction noise as it is all done by hand.The meals were great with sea food and other options available. Thanks to Beni for being creative with my drink. They have happy hour each afternoon which is good value. There were few children and we like it that way but expect that families do use this resort. The beach out the front is nice also with not much change with the tide. There is a spa and the rates are affordable.You can get a taxi to Senggigi for about 12,000 rupees. Some of the restuarants will pick up and deliver. There is a little shop across the road from the resort for supplies and laundry can be done at the resort or across the road. We also went into Mataram Mall and shopped.The resort is about 1 to 1.5 hours from the new airport depending on traffic. Treat the drive as a tour of Lombok. Lots to see along the way."

","Pure romance, excellent service, couldn't fault a single thing!","Apologies that this is a long review but there is so much to say.Let me start by saying the service we received started long before we even arrived! I was having difficulty booking my flights and the wonderful Viki sorted this out for us. Also the owner was incredibly patient with me - answering my many queries - all this before we'd even arrived.We arrived at the airport hot and bothered, our daughter had become ill in Singapoore and the heat made her feel worse, however the moment we walked out of the terminal the driver was there waiting for us with chilled water - I cannot tell you how welcome that was! The driver spoke perfect English, he was polite and helpful and happily pointed out interesting views etc along the way. The new airport had opened since our booking so it's now around 1 hr 20 minutes - but it didn't feel like it - the scenery and sights along the way are breathtaking and the time flew by!On arrival the fabulous service continued. It was as though they had just been waiting for us to arrive. We were handed cool scented towels and fruit drinks - so very welcome, before being escorted to our room.We were DELIGHTED with our room - it was an upstairs room with a view of the ocean - in fact the ocean was directly in front of our room and we were lulled to sleep every night to the sound of the waves - perfect! The room had a separate dressing area which was great as it enabled us to keep all our suitcases and clothes etc out of sight. The bathroom was charming - I hadn't expected an open air shower but was delighted that it was indeed partially open air - never been in a shower with a view like that before!Our balcony was great with a comfy day bed, chair and table - we enjoyed watching many amazing sunsets as well as fantastic tasty breakfasts on here.There are no TVs in the room - I was delighted about this but my husband wasn't too sure, however he soon saw the sense as no TV just adds to the peaceful and romantic ambience of the place, however we were assured that if we had wanted a TV one would be supplied.Housekeeping was probably the best we've ever encountered - never once had to ask for anything - it was always done in a timely way and on an evening they came and turned down the beds, plugged in mosquito machines and sprayed the room.If the staff know you are celebrating a special occasion they will come and decorate your room - its simply amazing- they arrange huge glass vases with fresh orchids in, from these are canes with glass vases hanging - each one containing a tea- light and a frangipani flower - then in the evening they come and light the candles - SOOO romantic!We were never really bothered with Mosquitos as the hotel sprays the area a couple of times a week - but this is a tropical location so it would be silly not to expect some bugs.The food in the restaurants (we ate at both) was top notch. Always fresh and top quality - we really loved everything we tried! Yes it is slightly more expensive than eating locally but well worth it for the quality. Breakfasts were simply delicious - none of this awful buffet affair here - everything was delivered to you perfectly presented, and there was lots of choice. A few mornings we had breakfast delivered to our balcony where it was beautifully laid out - what a way to start the day. The chef is very amenable and is happy to make anything else even if it's not on the menu.The pool is lovely - very peaceful and romantic. An infinity pool which looks out over the ocean. It's not your usual turquoise tiled affair - it's been very thoughtfully done with dark stone - I often saw it being cleaned, even the occasional leaf was quickly removed.The pool staff were also fabulous - the soft fluffy towels were all laid out with a fresh Frangipani flower each day - such a lovely touch! They were friendly and helpful and remembered our names from day 1!The beach was also lovely - we took a walk along the beach and the views were amazing. I hadn't expected to be able to snorkel at the beach in front of the hotel but Eko (a local guide who'd taken us to the Gillis) came along one day and took us snorkelling there and it was actually really good - we saw lots of fish and beautiful coral and our daughter even got to hold a puffer fish!A few people have mentioned the beach sellers here, let me give you my observations. Don't say you'll buy something another day if you won't - they will come back every day until you buy something. They are just trying to make a living and actually we had a laugh with them. My advice would be to buy anything at the start - then they'll leave you alone. Even if you don't want to buy anything they are still pleasant and are happy if you just politely say no thank you. My only suggestion would be that the security staff try to discourage the beach sellers from using the gazebo at the front of the property - a few times we wanted to lie there to enjoy the sea and get some shade from the sun - but all the beach sellers were either sitting in it or were all hanging around so you couldn't really relax as you were constantly being bothered by them - but if that's the only negative it's not really that bad.There were a few heavy thunderstorms while we were there but they were great entertainment and a relief from the sun.The area where Qunci Pool villas is situated was perfect for us. I wouldn't have liked to be in Sengiggi but it was easy to visit by taxi - very cheap and convenient.There was another (3rd) hotel being built whilst we were there so that the 3 hotels will all be linked - we hardly noticed any noise and were amazed how much work was done in the time we were there - don't know how they managed it so quietly!I've mentioned the fact that this place is very romantic quite a few times in this review - what I haven't mentioned is that it still managed to be romantic for us even though we had our (9/10yr old) daughter with us - that's a first for us!Some said that 12 nights would be too long for us but it really wasn't - we all loved it and I'm not ashamed to say that we shed a few tears to leave this place. During our trip we also stayed at the Pan Pacific in Singapore, Shangri la's Rasa Sentosa, and Raffles in Dubai - I hadn't expected this hotel to be anywhere up to the standard of these hotels but I can honestly say - hand-on-heart that this was by FAR the very best service we have ever encountered - ANYHWERE! We never once felt as though the service was insincere or for tips, we never found a single member of staff who wasn't of the same extremely high standard. All our food and drink orders were always exactly correct. I really don't know how the owner does it - he should be applauded for what he's done here! I did wonder if perhaps he rules with a rod of iron - but no - even the lovely driver who took us back to the airport on our last morning was telling us how very happy all the staff are, how they love working for 'Mr Scott' and what a great and happy atmosphere there is.We are very well travelled and have stayed in many 'high end' hotels - this is one of the very few that I would recommend unreservedly to anyone, and would without doubt be very happy to return to again and again!"

","Suits for those who need extra-relaxing hollidays","ok, this place is not for everyone..on our honemoon in Feb 2011 we stayed at two different hotels during our stay in Lombok. The first place we stayed on 2 nights was Vila Ombak at Gili Trawangan isle..which is amazing.Then we moved to the mainlain and stayed at Qunci..dont get me wrong the place is rather small-yet-intimate.The qunci has 2 different locations apart, yet within walking distance and both of the guess can enjoy both of the facilities.But i would not say its suits everyone, first the room we stayed at Qunci Ocean View room doesnt have any TV..which is maybe all of their room doesnt have..and mayben the Hotel puposely do this in attemp to have all their guess get-into-relaxing-mood.However our relaxing-mood a bit ruins during the day..where when we tried to relaxing by thepool (which great, since it has beach view), the street vendor/local walking by in large number and waiting right in front of entrance connecting the beach to the villa and tried to sell anything from necklace..rings..anything..Which is a bit distracting..so maybe the hotel needs to have private entrance to sort things out.Overall it was great but probably next time will try other hotel with private beach."

","Relaxing... but please have a barrier to enter the villas","I stayed with my family from 12 to 17 Dec at Qima room at Qunci Pool villas.Pros:- Staff are all friendly, efficient and is an asset to the resort - from Samsul at front office to Iskandar at restaurant and the housekeeping boys- Meals are tasty and appetising when plated, we hardly ate elsewhere though there were cheaper options- Grounds are immaculate- Serene setting- Rather extensive menuCons:- We didn't like the fact that we paid so much for a villa that could be seen from both flanks from the outside i.e. the main entrance which was open for all to see and the side where the private pool fountain was. This is a villa, and like other villas we stayed in, they had a door to enter and the occupants had privacy when in the villa -> so I won't recommend your villas for a romantic getaway. While I'm not a hotel developer, I would place Qima further away from the main path and tucked at a corner with the garden view rooms nearer the main path- Master room air-con wasn't so cold even at 16 Celsius. To the owner, your maintenance guy came on the second day and he tried his best to get the most out of the a/c - so pls don't censure him.Cannot be the gas as he topped it up I believe and it may be something is inherently wrong with the machine/condenser itself- Meal portions were small compared to a similar resort a mile up north in Lombok that we stayed in before and the eateries at Trawangan - Look into the containers / receptacles where still water percolates. Take a preventive measure pls.Overall, I would come back but won't book any of the villas at all."

","diamond in the rough","value for money here was great, ticked every box and were treated to luxury without having to pay to much for it, only negative is there was no TV in garden view room so when it rained there wasnt much to do.

","I am truly impressed","I will only checkout this Thursday but the experience in this place is simply hospitable. I paid a premium price for a tailored trip to Lombok as I have aged parents who prefer a laid back and comfy room. Price is not a problem for us but before choosing this hotel, we were considering the premium room of Sheraton and Puri Mas. Took a gamble and go for Quincy based on the reviews. We were taken aback when the room given upon arrival was a garden room. We were assured of an ocean view room in the service order by our travel consultant. I am truly impressed by the professionalism of the hotel reception staff to honour the room. No questions were asked and I am already feeling that I am an SPG member in any Sheraton hotels that I have stayed in numerous cities. We love our room and the assistance given by all staffs. Even though the local agency handling our room booked a partial ocean view ?! , the staff explained to us with regards to the discrepancy and assured us that we can still stay in our present room. That is the best hospitality that a boutique hotel can provide to its guests. It would be frustrating if we were to move out to another room despite the discrepancy made by our travel consultant and local agent. I am thankful to the management for their sensitivity and sincere hospitality. We are definitely bringing our relatives to Quincy next June to chill and this time round, book with them directly to avoid miscommunication. Ocean View Room.The Spa is equally good and looking forward to step onto the beach 50 m in front of the room. tomorrow! For the discrepancy, I am going to inform our travel consultant about the room booked for us in this rustic island.I just love Quincy now."

","Amazing property but can be improved =)","ProsThe infinity pool at the pool villas hotel is really wonderful and tranquil which allows us to have a relaxing holiday, and the Spa is great as well. We had several meals at the Quali restaurant and it was quite tasty as wellConThe call operator / reception staff need to adapt / be empowered more in terms of addressing pertinent issues raised by guests. I had booked a 1 bedroom villa with personal pool which was great (Qumbara), however, due to the ongoing construction at the neighbouring site, we were able to see at rather close range, construction workers walking around on the higher levels of the construction, from our open-air shower (which means they could look at us from above while we were showering)!!! Now, I have no issues with the construction, but clearly the hotel shouldn't make these ""compromised"" rooms available for stay when toilet privacy is not even guaranteed! Called the operator to politely request for a change to another villa with pool where we can at least have basic privacy OR downgrade us to another room type if the private pool villa is not available, but she said that construction would end soon at 5pm, and we can shower after that .... **faint** That's not solving the problem, plus how am I going to shower the next day in the morning? I can't possibly be expected to wear my swimwear everytime I wish to shower in my own room ? Voiced my concern and she said she would call us back. Another guy called back after a long 20 min wait, and he said they would arrange for a separate room for us to go to for our showers, now that's even more ridiculous as I have to travel around the resort each time I want to shower??!!?? At this point, I insisted on speaking to the Manager or person-in-charge, and the operator said they didn't know who he was and would have to get back to us. After another long 15 min wait, by which time I was almost running late for a Spa appointment at the hotel, a manager finally arrived to speak to us, and agreed to move us to another room after assessing the situation.Although we ""downgraded"" to another room type, at least the problem has been solved. Point which I wish to make is that the frontline staff really need to be empowered and allowed to make certain decisions to meet the basic comfort of the guests, and not always have rely on the Manager solving the problem (which took almost an hour to be resolved). Plus the options of (1) showering after 5pm when construction has ended; and (2) showering in another room clearly doesnt make sense from a customer perspective, which only seems to be inconveniencing the guestsWould I stay in Qunci in future? Possibly yes, but more attention needs to be paid to guests and providing guests with feasible options when issues arise. In comparison, having stayed at the neighbouring Puri Mas before staying at Qunci, I would say that the front-line staff at Puri Mas are generally more friendly and sincere, and able to acceed to guests' requests effectively"

","Qunci Pool Villas Hotel....STAY HERE!!!!","Wow! Seriously...Wow! Although I had never been to Lombok, I have been to Bali many, many times. So, when four of us decided to fly over for two nights, we didn't know what we would find. The Qunci Villa Pool Hotel is where we decided to book and it was FABULOUS! Beautiful beach, tranquil setting, impeccable service,, great food and spa. I met the owner...(hi owner...if you read this!) and he was laid back, just hanging out at the restaurant and a really nice guy. Our rooms both overlooked the pool and ocean. My friends enjoyed the hotel's private romantic dinner on the beach option. It looked impossibly romantic!! Little touches like a delivered fruit basket and turn down service made it all over the top for this very, very reasonably prices hotel. I WILL be going back. Of all the hotels we stayed in our 3 weeks...it won the blue ribbon. GOOD JOB!The only drawbacks..if you could even call them that...Were that the vendors on the beach would very nicely...I might add...hassle you to buy things while you were in the pool. But, we did buy some crafts out of respect for them trying to make a living. And that the new airport makes this hotel an extra hour away from the airport. But, staring out the car window made the time fly by. Better get to Lombok before it becomes congested like Bali!"

","Lovely and peaceful stay","My husband and I stayed here in May 2011 and were impressed by the quality of accommodation at competitive prices.The room didn't have a TV or mini bar/room service menu, however the room and hotel grounds were lovely and made up for this.Unfortunately it rained our whole stay, but we enjoyed the spa services at the sister hotel and made the most of the onsite bar and restaurant. Plenty of time was also spent on the suite's comfortable balcony lounges reading our novels.Of our 3 or 4 night stay, we went into town one evening for dinner. You must get taxi or hotel transfer as it's too far to walk.Although I don't personally plan to return to mainland Lombok anytime soon, I do highly recommend this hotel."

While we didn't book any specific honeymoon package, we were treated to it! Our room was the most gorgeous room in the resort #23; overlooking the infinity pool and ocean. It was decorated with fresh orchids and lit tea light candles throughout when we arrived; absolutely stunning! The food was more than amazing; so delicious.

The only negative point of this place is the amount of vendors waiting for the clients on their way to the beach.....some of them just stand for hours staring at you while at the pool trying to get some attention....frankly speaking it was a bit too much. The management of the resort should find a solution (like other establishments in the area have done) such as asking the vendors to display their things outside the resort and leave the clients in peace."

","Qunci in late 2011","I have stayed at Qunci a couple of times. Very relaxing, great pool and very friendly and attentive staff. From late 2011 to early 2012, the hotel is constructing a new hotel next door. This was not so annoying during our recent stay but management could think of some clever strategy to keep guests happy about the construction which could easily spoil their stay at Qunci. (Some form of discounts ?) I stayed in the Ocean View Villa and thought the slabs of boarding placed in the bathroom to hide me from the construction work was a little tacky. Some more attention to detail would be good. Apart from this small detail, Qunci was a great experience"

","Would definitely stay again","I stayed at Qunci Villas for three nights, and I really enjoyed it. The location was perfect, and the beach outside the hotel was clean and swimmable. There are tour guides on the beach by the hotel who can get a little annoying, but we were really happy with them when we used one to go on a day trip to the Gili Islands for snorkeling. The hotel was gorgeous. We had one beach view room and one garden room, and the beach view is absolutely worth the extra money. Breakfast was included in our rate, and it was excellent. In fact, everything I ordered from the restaurants was really good, including food and drinks, and the happy hour prices are very reasonable. I was a little worried when I read that they have outdoor bathrooms, because in my past experience, those have been dirty and unpleasant, but they were really nice at Qunci Villas and even added to its charm. The bathrooms were spotlessly clean, and the showers were great. The atmosphere is laid back, not really close to any nightlife, but I view that as a positive. I couldn't believe how great Qunci Villas was for the price, and I would definitely stay there again."

","welcome to paradise","Qunci villas was recommended by friends, tripadvisor and lonely planet and yes, it is absolutely true, you are pretty close to paradise. It consists of currently two places, the Qunci villas and the Qunci pool villas, with the later being a little bit the more posh version of Qunci villas. We stayed at the Qunci villas, which we felt was the right choice as the place was really calm and mellow and as the majority of the guests headed to Qunci pool villas we had the lovely pool all for ourselves. We took a villa with ocean view but any other villa (also the villa with garden view) would be great as the villa resort is lovely, flowers, a little bit of jungle and water. The lower level of the villas does have outdoor showers which is great but buy some mosquito repellent (available at the local shops in sengiggi) as mosquitos during the evening can become quite a hassle during rainy season. Food is really nice at Qunci villas: even if you are not a romantic do an evening dinner at Qunci pool villas, seats are directly set in the sand and you have the ocean just right in front of you. There is happy hour every day from 5 to 7pm, good possibility to stay on your front bench and watch the sunset over Bali. If it happens to rain good alternative is the Spa at Qunci pool villas which offer great treatments at reasonable prices in an absolutely relaxing surrounding. As mentioned by other travellers, now with the new airport finally open (dont expect the facilities to be new though) it is 1,5 hours drive to Qunci. Hotel will pick you up from the airport. Otherwise take a Bluebird taxi which are completely reliable and will cost around 200.000 Rupiah. Going to Sengiggi it is only 10 minutes drive (hotel will order a bluebird taxi) and costs you only around 12.000 rupiah. Here you have also more restaurants to choose from for dinner options, e.g. de quake, a very inexpensive but nicely set eatery directly at the beach. There is construction going on as Qunci is currently building a third Qunci directly in between qunci villas and qunci pool villas but do not worry noise is managable as Indonesian construction sites involve lots of manual working."

","A dream place, so relaxing","We stayed here on our honemoon in August 2009 and we couldn't have picked a better place. Spent 4 days here after 3 days in Hongkong. Beautiful place although the pool is very cold. There is waiter service on the sun loungers and luch and dinner were fantastic. We ventured out a couple of times and went to town for dinner. The horse and cart ride back was hillarious and the driver said that the horse liked all the bells and the horn. There was a power cut one night but it just made it all the more beautiful with candles everywhere. Just like the pictures and a great price. Only regret was that we didn't stay longer. There are some people selling stuff along the beach (beach buns) but if you are friendly to them they are friendly to you. I wish i could go back but im away to Japan in a few weeks so will reoprt back on that."

A good tip which I wish Id know before we left is (as annoyning as the beach hawkers are) we found they have some of the coolest stuff. For 25,000 IDR we had personalised bracelets woven, they had some of the nicest fabrics and designs for sarongs and we got them for 50,000 and smile right and they have some pretty good pearl jewellery that was hard to find once back in Bali.Be warned: We stayed in the smaller wing at Quinci and at 4:30am there is a prayer on loud speaker that is impossible to sleep through. Though it was wonderful to hear on our first morning ear plugs can not keep at bay what will promise to be a early morning wake up each and everyday.Aside from that they were fab, we needed to fly from Lombok to Bali very early in the Morning and as we left very early the manager organised to bring kettles with coffee and tea to us before we left (at 6am) and packed us some danishes and toast. It was such a wonderful gesture.:)"

","Great place on Lombok","We stayed here as the first part of my honeymoon and was greeted by a honeymoon cake and heart of flowers which was a nice touch. We stayed in the garden view room for the first couple of nights and then partial ocean view room - both were similar but we did prefer being on the first floor of the partial ocean view room as the balcony felt more private. Both rooms had an outdoor bathroom which worked well.The food was really nice and the two restaurants over this site and sister hotel provided a good selection of food at a reasonable price (not cheap but slightly less than in UK for a good quality feed), although cocktails and wine were more expensive than in UK.The pool was lovely and the view incredible. We used the spa for 2hours of treatment and a 'spice bath' and both were really good in a great setting. This is a 10-15 minute drive from Sengiiggi but having gone into town this seems like a good thing so that you can relax more. The hotel provides transport into town but not a pick-up which is a little disappointing."

","Qunci staff are gems!","Everything about the hotel is beautiful and clean but the real highlight of Qunci is the exceptionally attentive and amazing staff. Despite having arrived very late from Singapore, we were not rushed through check-in. In fact, we were warmly welcomed by the reception team. We were offered drinks and face towels and Anie patiently waited till everyone had settled down before any of paper procedures took place. Throughout the entire duration of our stay, the staff have handled all of our requests with aplomb and professionalism. Rooms were always clean and scented & food from both restaurants did not disappoint.A million thanks to Anie, Bambang, Shan (reception), Syamsul, Wiwit (restaurant), Ramli (security), the guys who helped to set up the televisions in both rooms 03 & 04 (I didn't catch any of your names but the parents & in-laws were especially grateful) & to the rest of the team I might have missed out accidentally, do help convey my thanks. A bouquet of thanks too for the reservations desk (Echa, Viki) - who handled all of my queries tirelessly & promptly. The whole experience was just simply superb from start to end. On behalf of my entire family, I thank ALL of you for the impeccable service and the genuine display of care and concern for our well being and comfort. :)Warm Regards,Sri Bayu & Raimie"

","great stay except !!!!!!","This was our third visit to Qunci Pool Villas and it is a wonderful place to relax. The rooms beautiful, the service amazing !!!!!!, the pool and sunbeds fantastic, the view is divine,the spa and the beach massage ladies are great .The food could improve a little,not a lot of meatless meals but its still good, breakfast is huge and choices are great.The but is......the music !!!! Generally we want to get away from it all !!!! ,the sound of the ocean is beautiful, as you are literally on the beachfront, but music is constantly played to drown it out. The management really need to look at this ,even if they played traditional music but is loud western that is just awful.My second but is !!!.We chose Qunci again because we don't want to spend our holidays with young children,been there and done that . but this visit !!!! Qunci is not designed in a way that is child friendly nor does the advertising imply this ,yet so many times this visit there were screaming children in the restaurant and pool (the pool is deep no shallow end etc) When we holiday we never go where there is lots of families etc for this reason.Perhaps the new hotel could accomadate families. The majority of people staying are honeymooners ,couples both young and older. We really felt we were unlikely to return because of this aspect. So beware if you have done the holidays with children and are just wanting a quiet child free holiday you may be dissappointed.The new airport does make for a much longer car trip maybe one and a half hours and a charge .The building didn't impact on our stay.We headed off to Gili Air for 3 weeks of diving after our 5 days here so keep Gili air in mind for your next holiday.Great placeDespite my two negatives Qunci is a beautiful holiday spot........"

","Nirvana is here in Lombok.","Looking out to the east coast of Bali seems another world away. But this is Nirvana. Blissful surroundings, set as a haven from the world- this is where you can lose yourself and forget work and the world in general. Close to Gilli islands (boat access) if you seek active time out from Qunci. Need a break? Breather? Regroup? Chill! This is the address!"

","Fantastic spot","This is my first time staying at a small hotel and I've got to say that I was quite impressed. Despite the construction next door which you can only hear if you're in your room during the day. Although, my wife was taking a shower in our outdoor shower this morning and there were the construction guys out where we could clearly see them. So she called to get them moved.We were here for 2 days as part if our honeymoon.Some of the highlights are:- fantastic service. Hardly gets any better. They accommodate for all requests. We missed the key to the lock for one of our suitcases and they came to cut it at our request. We needed to borrow and adaptor for a charger and they came right away with one. - the garden and the pool is really well decorated. They put fresh flowers everyday.- there set up candlelight dinner tables as close to the beach as you can. You can see the waves crashing next to you at the high evening. - the food is pretty good. Alcohol is quite expensive though. They charge almost 5 star western hotel prices."

","Nice","Qunci was nice and the service good, but not stellar. When we first arrived, they did not tell us that the generators were on, just outside of our room and nearly drove us mad because the outdoor shower caused an echoing that didn't make it pleasant to go into the bathroom. Once that was rectified, it was fine. The private pool was also too cold to use. However, the spa was grand and the treatments good. The food was also tasty. On the whole nice, just too touristed and large for our personal liking."

","Confused ?","Let me start by saying I have stayed at Qunci two times already and really like it. The 1st time was just after the Tsunami and then again about 2 years ago. I am looking at the reviews again as I am thinking about going back for a third time.The thing I find strange about the reviews (and annoying about the hotel) is that there seems to be no mention of the beach hawkers and their constant hassle of guests. When I stayed the beach was public (has that changed ?) and was mere feet from the pool. Don't get me wrong, I understand that people need to make money, but the attention foisted upon guests here was over the top and eventually just annoying. Q : has this changed ? are there fewer / less aggressive beach vendors ? Are the pool villas facing / near the beach, these are a new addition and of interest."

","Nothing short of paradise!","As we were unable to leave Gili Trawangan by boat to Bali due to rough seas, we ended up on Lombok for a night before flying to Bali the following morning. Qunci Villas Hotel was recommended to us by our driver, and his recommendations didn't fall short! These villas were wonderful, great beach location & atmosphere, lovely grounds and fantastic staff!The room was spacious and lovely and the outdoor bathroom was fantastic!We received a fruit platter on arrival and impeccable service throughout our stay and had 2 of the most amazing massages we have ever had at the Villa's spa - Second to none!The hotel also hosts an amazing sunset - Highly recommended!!"

","Satisfying except some minor occasional thing","We were staying in qunci villa for 2 nights, got an excellent service from the staff and such a wonderful honeymoon room set up for the first night. It was very nice of them to decorate the room with candles and flowers, totally sweet :)The breakfast was great, very fresh and not disappointing. Couldn't stop adoring the view of the beach and the morning air of the hotel's backyard. The only thing that we found very annoying was the fact that our bathroom was very dusty on the first minute we arrived there. It was the same thing for tomorrow morning too, after the clean up time. At first we thought it was just the standard (can be very disappointing if it's true), but to be fair.. we found out that it was because of the development progress that they are having beside our hotel area. They are currently expanding their hotels and villas, and working on a new building between the two area that are already there. So, we found out that the sea wind has brought those dust and dirty sands to our room.. because our bathroom was actually ""semi outdoor"" (but the bedroom was save and clean). Anyhow, it was quite a surprise because everything in the bathroom was dirty and dusty (clothes hangers, wash table, and the top of cabinet). Hopefully this thing will be solved once the development progress is done."

","Words can't describe...","We have just returned from 6 nights in a 1 Bedroom Pool Villa - this resort exceeded ALL our expectations as did Lombok... we have already booked our return visit for next April and we will be taking our two teenagers with us to show them this unspoiled beautiful island. The pool villa is stunning, as are the grounds, the pool, the view & the restaurant. The photo's on the website are great but do not truly show how stunning this place is. The food is very nice and we enjoyed the breakfast, which was very different to having a buffet, but a nice change - you can opt to have this in your villa or at either of the restaurants. Contrary to a recent review posted here, we found the food and alcohol (excluding the wine due to import tax) to be very reasonably priced. We usually stay at 4-4.5* resorts in Asia and we found Qunci prices to be similar or less. Most of the main meals at dinner were $10-15 AUD which is very reasonable. The staff are SUPERB - they have such pleasant placid natures and will go out of their way to see to your needs. They are polite and never invasive to your privacy. Sometimes the language barrier was difficult but usually ended in a good laugh!At first we didn't think there was very much to see/do in Lombok (Mataram & Sengigi are a dump!) - then we went up north to the Waterfall and saw what a beautiful place Lombok is. Then down to the South, Kuta beach is awesome and so is the village there. Very traditional and simple. A trip to a Sasak village is a must to understand the culture and appreciate their world. Sengigi is close for supermarket supplies and money exchange (only $2 in taxi to get there) - however the exchange rate at Qunci was only slighter lower, which was another sweet surprise compared to bigger resorts. Basically whenever we paid for something at Qunci; food, drinks, spa, money exchange etc we never felt like we were being ripped off, we felt they were fair with their costs.Of course lazing around Qunci is wonderful too and sadly we would've enjoyed a couple more days to do this. Have a massage at the beachfront from Sap (under the resorts gazebo) - she is amazing and such a lovely soul. The people on the beach do NOT hassle you - they ask you to buy their wares (this is legal AND it is their job) but they do not hassle. Daily we sat and chatted with them - their culture is amazing and so are their stories. We bought them drinks when we wanted to but never felt obligated. Yes the praying, especially at 4.30am is loud but it is their culture and it just adds to the beauty of the island and it's people (and I am not religious in any way). After a couple of days it didn't really wake us, but if it did we soon went back to sleep, or got on with our day - after all, you're on holidays so it's not really a big deal. Chooks?? Yes we heard them, so what???..... Oh and the school is across the road and the sounds of children happily playing may wake you up (they start early) but is that so tragic??The resort was very quiet, yes there were children there but they were very well behaved, thank you to those two families :-) On our second last day a large wedding party did arrive and it did change the dynamics somewhat - it felt busier/noisier but certainly not in a disturbing way. As it is such a serene place most people seem to feel that way so they are mindful of their noise. As we are taking our teenagers next year, we will be making sure we keep the noise level down.Our review... Qunci is perfect in every way and great value for money. Lombok and its people are beautiful and we cannot wait to return."

","Awesome place, beach, villas & people","This place is great for short escapes nor long holiday. Food, room, staff, pool, restaurant are great. Spa is the best one. Natural facial is awesome. Great value, great sunset. Breakfast by the ocean.. Overall this is the type of accommodation you should visit and stay while youre in Lombok. The only ""not so good"" things here is people will try to sell you things all the time when youre at the ocean or sitting near to the ocean. This is very disturbing, but I understand that local try to make a living."

","Wonderful vacation- great hotel and fantastic staff","Spent 3 nights in Qumbang Villa (1BR) on the hill and then 2 nights in Garden View villa at QPV.Qumbang is unique- a few quirks, but we'd return in a heartbeat. A 3-5 minute walk across the street from the main property and up the hill. Two levels- with private plunge pool (infinity), bathroom, kitchen and living room at ground level. Bedroom, master bathroom and huge walk-out deck upstairs. Also the master bath is open air which was wonderful. I don't recommend this place for small kids- lots of sharp edges. But perfect for a couple. I've read other reviews complaining about the noise. Yes- there is a lot of noise. It is the first villa on the hill adjacent to a small village. You definitely get the mosque noise (chanting, humming are nice but the sermon was a bit jarring at 5am), also roosters, goats, cats fighting, dogs barking and babies crying. We got accustomed to the noise- it wasn't a big deal and it added to our experience. There are bugs from time to time, but I'd expect that with the open air. Two nice gentlemen came each morning to make breakfast. In the evenings, we'd stumble down the main property for happy hour and dinner.Our final two nights at QPV were a bit of a let-down after Qumbang. Our room was comfortable and clean and we liked the outdoor bathroom but we obviously missed the privacy of our own villa. The pool area at QPV is nice- we didn't go to the pool at the other property. There are hawkers at the beach selling their goods. But they are quite genteel and will not bother you after they know you are not interested. One nice thing about the pool is the hushed environment. Other guest were all couples- lots of honeymooners. Some guests had small children/toddlers. However, on the last day a large family of large and loud guests arrived which changed the peaceful atmosphere. I realized how easily the overall experience can change at a small hotel after their teenager's first cannonball into the pool.Slight complaint about the food. We ate at both restaurants and weren't impressed. This is contrary to other reviews so it could be our own taste. Most guests were European so perhaps the menu wasn't made for our California palate. On the last evening, we opted for appetizers by the pool and enjoyed that more than the sit-down dinner. Also we've had better breakfasts at other Asian beach resorts. QPV's breakfast was not buffet so you miss out on a huge selection. There are few choices at breakfast (e.g. eggs, egg toast, asian, continental). We found breakfast, like dinner at the restaurants, to be underwhelming. But since our activity was limited to lying by the pool, we didn't need the calories of a buffet breakfast.Finally- can't write this review without mentioning the wonderful staff. They are warm and engaging, They may not provide polished service a la Ritz Carlton or Four Season, but we weren't looking for that. QPV's staff goes out of their way to deliver friendly welcoming service."

","Great hotel","Fantastic boutique hotel (incredible design, amazing pools with a view on Bali's volcano Agung at sunset, comfortable rooms, great breakfast, food and cocktails). The staff is 5-star. No need to say more in view of all the psoitive comments already posted (and deserved).It is overall great value for the price of the rooms. Food and drinks are, however, very expensive for Lombok standards and more in the price range of Bali 5-stars hotels. This is also valid for the Spa, but the Spa is 5-star (massages on the beach is, however, of good quality cheaper)."

","Great value","A close friend (thanks, John) told us about Qunci, adding to the list of reasons we are grateful to him. This is, in our view, the best all around value place to stay in Lombok. Itâs beautiful here. Tasteful, soothing, chic, Qunci Villas is really three small hotels â two are beachfront almost next door to each other, save for the small guest house owned by someone else. But itâs a quick, easy walk on the beach to get between the two properties. Even the least expensive garden view room in Qunci Hotel is charming. Itâs worth it to spend a little bit more and stay at the almost-adjoining, more upscale Pool Villas Hotel. The third property is perched on a nearby hill, offering stunning views of the surrounding area. It is the most exclusive of the three properties.One of the best things about Qunci is their breakfasts, which can be served on your verandah â a feature of all of the rooms. The selection of American/European and Indonesian options is great and improves all the time. On our last visit, we loved their pancakes â an elegant version of the McGriddle, involving two proper American pancakes served with a layer of beef bacon, thin slices of apples, and cheese tucked in between, and finished with a light dressing of maple (sadly, maple-flavored, rather than the real thing) syrup. If you seek quiet solitude, avoid a room near the restaurant, where each evening beginning at about 4pm, there is somewhat loud club music emanating from the ample speakers, reverberating to nearby guest rooms."

","Excellent place ! ! !","We stayed four night at this hotel, and really enjoyed it ! !The swimming pool with sea view is just perfect, and comfortable. The staff is very friendly, the happy hours during sunset unforgettable and the Spa is . . . .heaven. It is 30 minutes walk to Sengigi or a few minutes by car or scooter ( to be hired in front of the hotel). The food was however very typical of Indonesia, and we prefered definitely the restaurant of the smallest part of the hotel.A very good address in Lombock ! !I am however not sure that it is worth paying for a sea view villa, given the disposal of villas in the hotel."

","Love this place","We have stayed at Qunci twice in the past year and are already looking forward to returning. The rooms are well appointed (we've always had ground floor - for the outdoor shower) and relaxing and the grounds are beautiful. We travelled with our 6 month old son and was provided with on of the sturdiest cots i've ever seen in my life. I'd recommend the older section for parents with kids - it seems more open to kids and a little less adult orientated. You can still go across there, but there seems to be mroe honeymooners over there!This is a small resort, so you don't have acres of land to avoid others on holiday, but i've never found that to be an issue. What Qunci provides is some great relaxation oppurtunities and amazing service.You will find cheaper hotels and food in Indonesia, but after living in the country for 6 months, you'll find the cheapness comes at a cost of quality and attention to detail. Qunci is quite obviously under foreign ownership and strives to achieve. THe food is gerat, the cocktails are sensational and lounging by the pool is brilliant.Few quick tings: Hawkers do try and sell to you from the beach, as is their right. It is a public beach. Have a chat to them and be nice. Being a rude and obnoxious foreigner will just put a dampener on your holiday. Go have a laugh with them or hang out at the warung to the right of the villa if you have kids. There is two wonderful ladies that give very decent massages on the hotel grounds thatt work from the beach (they have an agreement to be their, they're not tresspassing). There is always some sort of renovation going on or gardening - better than letting the place fall apart. And finally - there are no TV's. AAARRRGHHHH!! You might have to talk to your partner or children! Heavens above! By far one of my favourite things about this place is the lack of a TV - you have to talk, and whatever else. Not watching Die Hard with Indonesian subtitles.We always found the staff incredibly helpful to us and with our baby, you might occasionaly get a temporary babysitter if the restaraunt is quiet and the staff are keen. Make the most of it to finish you meal!"

","Amazing views, definately worth a stay","My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon. We were welcomed with cold towels and fruit juice - very refreshing! Our villa was really nice, private pool and sunbeds, we even got a honeymoon cake:) The open air shower is quite different, but if you shower in the evening or early in the morning when its slightly windy, it feels quite cool and uncomfortable if you are like me and prefers steaming hot water!The restaurant is really nice and has the most amazing views of the ocean. Breakfast menu is quite extensive and very very filling! The hotel staff are very friendly right down to the gardeners who say hello to you as you walk by. The beach is very nice and relatively clean, the only disadvantage is that here are locals who try and sell you their products, but that is to be expected and once you say no, they usually don't bother you again. The hotel also has a sister hotel 5 minutes walk down the beach where you can also go and have dinner. Options were limited for dinner being veggies, but they managed to cater for us which was nice.Definitely worth a stay, as its is really peaceful and quite and as I said before the restaurant has the most amazing views."

","Service was the best ever experienced!","There are three types of property (Luxury Villas, Pool Villas and lastly, Hotel) at Qunci and we stayed at all three during our 5 nights at Qunci. We arrived at the one bedroom villa, Qumbang, and were not happy to find the place not living up to our expectations. The villa did not work for our one year old baby plus the loud prayers from the nearby mosque did not help matters. However, one phone call and trip to the ever efficient Manager, Witwit solved all problems! We were offered a transfer to the luxury three bedroom villa (sharing with other guests) for the first two nights before moving to the Qunci Pool villas. I was hesitant on sharing but they took me to view the villa at 9.30pm and I was sold! The three bedroom villa is simply gorgeous! Spread out over a large space and with an open lounge and dinning areas, it felt like a mini boutique hotel on its own! We also ended up having a great dinner on the second night with the other guests staying in the villa. On the third day, we had to move to the Qunci Pool Villas and again, we were surprised at how great the accommodation it is. All the rooms have a great balcony with great comfy furniture and outdoor showers. It was also minutes away from the beach. The last property we were given was the oldest of the three - the Hotel. Our flight was late at night but the staff arranged a room at the Hotel for us so that our baby could take his nap and our shower there before heading to the airport - a great lifesaver!All the staff members we came across were friendly and very very helpful! The staff made the holiday truly great and they would help solve any problems you may have. They never once complained and also seemed genuinely pleased and happy to help. I'm the most impressed with the staff and their help was an added bonus to us, traveling with a one year old. And the food is great as well! Qunci is definitely a place that is on our list of regular holidays and the only headache we have now is to decide which of their properties to go to when we next head back to Lombok!"

","Excellent hotel where you can admire a beautiful sunset view on Gunung Agung","We arrived at this hotel just by coincidence, having booked before a room in a hotel in Singgigi from where we ran away!Qunci hotel is located at the Mangsit beach. We were given a room close to the entrance which was a bit noisy because of the traffic. However, the room was confortable with airco, modern bathroom and terrace. But if you look for a quiet place, just book a room with ocean view, a little bit more expensive but it really worths. The staff is very friendly and helpful, having breakfast is almost like having lunch, very complete and various!! We had diner twice and the food was really excellent. You may want to try delicious dishes with fish such as Mahi Mahi.If you need to rent a scooter, the hotel can arrange it for you. Don't hesitate to negociate it, we paid 55,000/day for a 3-days trip.The hotel also organises dance performance on Thursday night with typical sassak music."

","Noisy","I am surprised to read ""quiet"" or ""peacefull"" in some reviews as this was the noisier place we stayed in Indonesia. The mosq was the least of the disturbances. From very early in the morning you could hear the noises from nearby construction works, this gave way to children screams and crying, the motorcicles on the road, the thumping of the staff cleaning the matrasses, gardening and finally the unnecesary music on the beach area. Outside and inside the room as the thatched roof has no insulation.I would not recommend this hotel to tranquility lovers."

The word is out, Qunci was very busy with all pool side beds taken up very quickly. Still I would go back, the staff are lovely and views gorgeous. Special thanks to Iskandar for great service!"

","We totally loved it, except the private villa","I booked one of the private villas first. It was a nightmare, because:1. villa is in the village, which is full of very vocal roosters and chickens, also at night2. people from the village can see you swimming in your pool3. there are 2 mosques close by. Around 4 am they are getting loud and vocal as well...4. in order to get to the hotel and its facilities you need to call for a car. It takes 5-7 min, but if you forgot something....We stayed there only for 1 night (obviously could not sleep), manager of the hotel totally understood our concern and moved us to a bungalow at ""Qunci pool villas"" (go to their website and check the difference!). We loved the place - great pool, restaurant, and attentive staff. They are really trying to do their best for the guests. We would love to stay there (not in the private villa :) again."

","Great hotel, beautiful beach and perfect sunsets","We stayed at Qunci Villas for ten nights. We enjoyed our stay very much. It's a lovely and stylish hotel with only 22 rooms. We had a garden view room on the ground floor. Our room had indoor and outdoor sitting areas (as do all other rooms) and an outdoor bathroom. The garden looks beautiful and provides enough privacy. The pool has the clearest water I've ever seen. The beach is narrow in front of the hotel, but when you walk a few meters to the right you will find a quiet and magnificent looking beach almost all to yourself. Breakfast was very tasteful and so was the food served in the restaurant. The waiters looked after us in a personal manner. Very friendly people and great service! The staff at the reception was helpful as well. Best part of the day: watching the sun go down behind Bali's Gunung Agung vulcano while enjoying a cocktail on a deckchair..."

","My favourite stay in Lombok","Great hotel not far from the more touristy area of Sengigi. We stayed for 2 nights and had a garden view room which was enormous with a lovely terrace area. The small personal touches were nice such as cold towels and drink on arrival and sometimes complementary fruit kebabs were brought around for those relaxing by the pool. We were also left a complementary plate of fruit in our room. The restaurant served good food and the staff were really friendly."

","I missed my flight just so I could stay here another night","I stayed here as part 2 of my honeymoon(with the first part in Grand Hyatt Bali) and it perfectly exemplifies why when on vacation I prefer hotels like Qunci Villas over your Starwoods/Hyatts and all. There is so much charm and personality to this hotel and I seriously did miss my flight and stayed here for another night. I stayed back in December in the private pool villas which was lovely and comfy and was everything that I could have hoped for in a honeymoon destination in Lombok. You get your privacy in your own mini pool but the main pool itself was a beautiful infinity pool with a gorgeous view. The staff were amongst the friendliest and personable hotel staff i have ever encountered. The fact that there was no television in the room makes it an even better honeymoon hotel. All in all such a lovely property with such lovely people.Next part I have to mention deserves a seperate paragraph of its own. The food in the hotel is simply the awesomest food in a hotel I have ever tasted. Everything I ate there during my stay was simply awesome. Apparently the chef also has a restaurant in the town area and we ate there as well and it was just as awesome. I want to go back!"

","Great value for money","We arrived to QV after a few days of the backpacker grunginess of Gili Air, and were generally delighted with what we discovered. Rooms are large and airy, although very close together so your personal balcony may well be within view of several other rooms nearby. We had a room on the ground floor facing out to the swimming pool - fantastic in that you get the ocean view, but not so great in that for much of the time your view is of other people sitting around the pool! Make sure you keep those curtains closed...!The happy hour is a great touch - and allows you to get stuck into some of the cocktails at relatively decent prices (for a high-end resort). The food in general is excellent - the traditional breakfast buffet of tired fruit and cold fried eggs has thankfully been omitted, and you order your omelette/fruit etc. to have it freshly made. A snack of fresh fruit around tea time is great.For me the downside was never-ending (and mildly aggressive) insistence of the hawkers on the beach trying to flog their T-shirts/handicrafts from morning til night. I know this is a constant issue in many parts of the world, and have no problem with people trying to sell their goods to tourists... but.... when you're paying for seclusion, relaxation and private time alone, the last thing I want to be doing is trying to avoid a hawker's gaze, cries and incessant bother. I also don't want to be forced to move elsewhere in the resort, away from the beach just to get away from the sales pitch. If you want to feel like a walking wallet, take a sun lounger at the end of the resort and wait to be offered all manner of trips, taxi rides, T-shirts, marijuana etc. I know this isn't officially the hotel's problem - all this officially takes place OFF the hotel property - but it does impact on the enjoyment of your stay if you have precisely ZERO interest in expanding your collection of South East Asian beer brand T-shirts.Despite all this, my lingering memory of QV will be sipping an ice-cold Bintang watching the sun set behind the enormous volcano on next-island-along Bali. Sometimes Indonesia just gets it so, so right."

","Feels like home!","This is my 2nd stay in Qunci Villas, I have to apologise to Wiwit for not putting in my review for my first stay especially since they made us all feel so welcomed. I previously spent 1 week in Qunci - Qusia for our 5th year wedding renewal of vows. Wiwit was lovely in helping with all my planning and organising the event for me and my 20 guests. This time round, I spent another week with 6 of our friends in Qusia as well as Qunang. Hotel:I've had the opportunity to spend quite a bit of time in Qusia. Can i just say it is well worth every cent! 3 generous bedrooms, 5 bathrooms, 1 large infinity pool and 1 dipping pool, 2 dining tables, a gym and lots of sitting areas to chill. Everything is oversized, comfortable and well decorated. Qunang on the other hand has a different sort of charm. It is cosier and smaller but i feel it somehow wasn't as homey or well maintained as Qusia. It does have a very interesting outdoor shower. Food:The food is amazing in Qunci. I was very surprised to read that someone complained about the breakfast. The portions of fruit are very generous (definitely not 3 slices!) and they even noticed that i do not eat bananas or paw paw and replaced it with something that i do it! My friends seem to particularly enjoy the Mangsit beach breakfast, I'm adore the mee goreng. The only upsetting thing, they've taken away my bubur ayam!!! The highlights of staying in the luxury villa is the personal chef (USD10 per day?) The chef took us to the local markets to buy our produce as well as cooked us a lovely bbq and of coz malva pudding!!!Service:I can go on forever with examples of how wonderful the service is in Qunci (although to be truly honest, it didn't feel as personal as 3 years ago). The service is still amazing and they put in every little bit of effort to make sure that you are relaxed happy and content. Each time you come back, it really feels like you're home. I'm looking forward to my next trip 'home'!"

","Smashing Hotel","Stayed at the Qunci Villa in June weather was beautiful. Although the hotel is on a narrow block the feel of the hotel is quite spacious. The rooms are large airy and spotlessly clean, a very nice touch was an outdoor loo and shower very swish. Beds are comfortable and there is a turndown service at night, the staff spray the rooms for those dreaded mozzies, and if needed give you clean towels. Laundry service is also good and cheap.  I did wake on the call to prayer a couple of mornings but it was quite nice and the Island is Muslim. The restaurant is good mix of Indonesian and European meals and well-priced. An excellent breakfast is served at the pool restaurant or in your room.The service from the staff was spot on; I nearly had a heart attack when I realized there was no kettle in the room. I asked at reception and within a blink of an eye a kettle was in the room. The pool is delightful and overlooking the ocean; just donât make eye contact with the sellers on the beach. The hawking of goods is a bit constant but this happens all over the island, but a simple NO or shake of the head and they do move on. A thing to bear in mind that there is 60% unemployment on the island and that does make people a bit desperate. Altogether this is a smashing hotel."

","Amazing place...we will be back!","A fabulous place to stay. We went with our four year old son and eventhough it is more of a couples resort, children are very welcome and our son had lots of fun. The service is great - yes maybe a few very minor hiccups but having lived in Asia for a few years now we have come to expect this. We stayed one night in a hotel room and then moved for 7 nights into Qumbang Villa, one of the private villas up a hill just a very short walk from the main resort. It was fabulous! the villa was stunning and it was nice to have our own pool especially for my son so he could be a little noisier as the main pools in the resort are quite quiet. The decor and facilities were great and it was so nice having a jungle surrounding. The one drawback was the mosque nearby so one did experience the call to prayer at around 6am and then the chickens would join in! but it did not deter as after a while you got used to it so could ignore it or you just got up to enjoy the early delights of the day. Since it is not a wild crazy place in terms of nightlife it does mean you can have lovely early nights for a change!! We then stayed 2 nights in a pool villa which was great too and good to try a different type of accommodation in the resort. I would recommend this place as my family and I had the most relaxing holiday ever. If you want to go crazy with trips and hiking etc you can though. A trip to the Gillis islands snorkelling and fishing is recommended - we went with a guy called Ahmed who was on the beach and the only guy to have a goatee and he was great. If you are going to Lombok for a relaxing holiday this is the place to go - we will definitely be returning at some stage in the future."

","Great Place for Couples","We originally plan to book for 2 nites in this hotel however we only manage to get 1 nite. We managed to get the garden view room in the hotel.The hotel is really cute with the small infinity pool facing the ocean. The small bar area facing the ocean as well. Room is not bad (very ethnic style) and the bathroom is really something unique. It is purely open air, we bath surrounded by the plants and a grasshopper. It would be lovely for couples but maybe not for family with children as the pool is not so fun and the beach is kind of rocky.The bed room itself is quite ok, the ,matress was not heavenly comfy though, We love our terrace which we can lie down in the sofa and chat the nite away. It was really quiet and we really enjoyed the serenity while listening to the sound of the ocean's wave. The room rate was included airport transfer and an ala carte breakfast. The food was amazingly delicious. It was something different from the usual hotel buffet where we got all those oily bacon, egg, bread etc. In Qunci we can choose the menu such as : quesadillas or pancake. It all came witha fresh fruit platter and choice of coffee and tea. All in all for the price of Rp 780.000 per nite it was a really good deal and we would love to come again and try the Qunci Villas Pool. as a couple."

","Anniversary in Paradise","We recently stayed at the Qunci Pool Villa's in Lombok and we thoroughly enjoyed our time at the villas and hope to be back.We enjoyed the Qunci Villa's location and design of the villa's as it was easy to get around and not over crowed like some complexes can be. The intimacy makes it a good place to get away and celebrate special events or just relax and enjoy the serenity.As we were celebrating our 20th Anniversary we had asked for flowers and candles to be placed in our room on arrival, which were beautiful, but totally surprised when we also received a cake.On the night (10th) of our anniversary we organised to have the Romantic dinner. We could see your staff setting up the Gazebo early in the afternoon, when we arrived at 7pm for pre dinner drinks, staff were still trying to place flowers around on the floor, unfortunately that night was very windy and no matter how hard they tried the flowers were just blowing away. We told them they could stop placing the flowers around as they were just not going to stay. They were so apologetic for not being able to set up the gazebo with all decorations. We greatly appreciate the effort they went to trying to ensure we had the perfect night for our anniversary.We can not thank your staff enough for the wonderful time we had at the Qunci Pool Villa's, it will always be a fond memory and we are glad we chose it to celebrate our anniversary and have no hesitation in recommending Qunci villa's to our friends.We ask you to please pass on to all staff at the Qunci Pool Villa's our thanks for their hospitality to have their guest feel comfortable and making sure they have an enjoyable time at the villa's."

","Excellent!","We're doing a Bali-Lombok tour in which we visit a number of hotels in the 3* - 5* range. Qunci offers the best value yet. Apart from the staff, the friendliest I've ever seen (they almost all know your name in 1 day, 'hello's' all the time), the layout of the villa's and rooms is well thought out, everything is clean and being cleaned all time and the food and drinks are very good and nicely presented (though a little bit expensive sometimes). Breakfast is also more than ok, with the Padi Padi wrap, the culinary upgrade of the banana pancake, being a favorite.One small disadvantage, which Qunci not really can help, is the hawking taking place on the beach and at the border of the hotel area (close to the pool side). When you are looking for sarongs, scarfs, wrist bands, necklaces, massages, boat trips or many other products and services, you can be busy for days. When you're not interested, well, be prepared to having to say 'no, thank you', with a smile of course, a lot. The hawkers are not very annoying or persistant, they will not keep on bothering you for a long time.To conclude: stay here when you want to go to Lombok, you won't be disappointed!"

","Great hotel, but maybe a case of style over substance?","We stayed at the Pool Villas, the newer part of the qunci villas hotels in Mangsit, in a private villa with own pool - the equivalent of their best room available. The villa was amazing, spacious with a stunning private pool and decked area, and a fab open air shower and bathroom. Modern decor, very clean and well maintained and having own pool was a massive treat! The hotel itself exudes cool, chic, stylish design (think marble paving and grass lawns, wooden bale's, seating in teak or polished pieces of natural wood, and lots of rattan screens), is pretty, well maintained, with a great beachside infinity pool, nice bar/restaurant and a good spa. (wife had manicure and pedicure, I had Javan salt scrub and Lulur massage). The downside, if you can call it that, is that the level of spoken English by staff was nit that great so service suffered as a result- they manage simple restaurant and poolside ordered well, but no banter or chatter, except stock phrases. Also a lot of 'lingering' when Serving food and drinks, which felt like they were waiting for tips from their 'cash cow' tourist guests. As we were staying for over a week this got a little tiresome. No one seemed able to understand even slightly complicated requests (e.g please may I have a large jug of COLD milk for my coffee, which in spite of rephrasing many different ways over the week we stayed always resulted in a little jug of hot milk!) The lack of basic english and poor service training meant the overall level of service in adequate but not world class given this is a fairly pricey hotel for the region and was a real shame. There was lots of willingness overall, but jus not the aility to understand and get things done. Food - both lunchtime and evening meals was fine, but not world beating, some oddities, like their beef burger was made with a bolognase (?spelling) meat so tasted totally unlike any burger i've ever eaten! Seafood and local Indonesian style curries were good, flavoursome affairs but again nit as great as lonely planet would have you believe they are. So overall, a great hotel environment, but on,y average service and food. That said, we really enjoyed our stay here and felt the place to be friendly, relaxed, teas bale valuefor money and will definitely come again, aware of the places flaws but willing to accept this for the great atmosphere, style and amazing sunset.(in view of bali's mount agung)."

","Great value. Amazing.","This is a great value hotel. We paid USD 110 (+21% tax and service charge) per night, but the quality of the hotel is more like a $200+ luxury hotel.We stayed at the Qunci Pool Villas, which is about 50 meters down the beach/road from Qunci Villas Hotel (and I'd recommend the Pool Villas - the other hotel looked very similar, but the Pool Villas has - you guessed it - the much nicer pool).Our room was really nice, with an outdoor lounge area and a huge open air bathroom. The 'infinity' pool overlooking the beach is the main appeal, perfect for lounging around. The food was good, albeit more expensive that restaurants in nearby Senggigi. The staff were genuinely warm and attentive. Breakfast was included, and there was a good choice of options. The gardens and buildings all have really nice design touches, everywhere you look. I don't think this would be an ideal choice for people seeking lots of activities. Nearby Senggigi is relatively quiet. A trip to the Gili islands is the natural day trip. Besides the hotel is so nice there is no need to leave! It's more of a relaxing destination - perfect for couples but also great for families looking for a pool holiday (75% of the people in the hotel when we stayed were on honeymoon!)."

","A place for ultimate relaxation","We booked the foremost ocean view villa. And what a view it was except for the gazebo right out front but that gave us a birdseye view for the romantic dinners. The sound of the ocean at night was quite soothing. And the bathroom with shower that you look up to the sky. The meals were delicious also. Strange that there was a tv so you could have something to do but if you love reading which most people out on sun lounges seemed to do then you are set. Sengiggi is closest town and cost only 15000 rupee. Mataram was a waste of time as not much there. We didnt do any sightseeing but we just wanted to lay around pool really."

","It has to be Qunci","I am writing this as I sit on the balcony of Room 28 of the Qunci Pool Villas Resort where we are enjoying our final breakfast before departing to Bali from Mataram Airport on our 12:35 flight with Wings/Lion Air............well that's the scheduled time, if it's anything like the journey out here from Bali it will actually depart nearer to 4pm!I can't see why anyone would stay anywhere on Lombok other than Qunci. It's not the biggest (original Qunci Villas is 20 rooms/bungalows/villas and the newer Pool Villas is just 22 rooms) but this is what makes it what it is. Not sure what the total staff to guest ratios are but it must be almost one to one or at least it has been this week as the hotel(s) certainly don't seem at capacity.Â Both hotels (although they are actually in reality one hotel split by 100m of beach) have fantastic restaurants. We ate out a lot in nearby Sengiggi but the food at Qunci is amazing and isn't actually expensive at all compared to UK hotels and others in Europe. An appetiser is going to cost you Â£2.50-Â£4.00 and a main course around Â£5.00 - Â£7.50. All prices are subject to 21% tax and I assume service as there is no space on bill to add a tip when you sign for your bill. Locally you can eat for half of that but as we learnt it can be a bit hit and miss. Drinks are very expensive, particularly wine which is about Â£30 for the cheapest bottle of what we buy in the supermarket back home for Â£7 and don't forget that Â£30 is subject to a further 21% tax. To be fair, wine is extremely expensive all over Asia it seems.Â We had a first floor Ocean View room (No 28). Large comfortable loft style queen size bed, a day bed in the room as well as another on the very large balcony. Aircon is very efficient, a bit noisy though and occasionally a funny smell. I shall mention this on checkout although it really didn't bother us enough to warrant a complaint. Bathroom is semi outside in that the actual shower area is open to the elements. No one can see you showering of course unless they have climbed one of the 50 ft high palm trees that are next to the room. Our only complaint about the room was the lack of storage. No bathroom cabinet, an exposed hanging rail in dressing area with 6 hangers and only 2 small drawers. We lived out of a suitcase for 5 days but it was not a problem. Room has a fridge/mini bar stocked with water, soft drinks and a couple of Bintang (beer). Drinks from the mini bar are actually not that expensive. About Â£1 for a can of coke and Â£1.75 for a can of Bintang. You get two complimentary mini bottles of water a day and further water is available at around Â£0.80 per bottle.The resort has free WiFi all over the place. Extremely good fast coverage so if you have a smart phone or iPad or laptop with you, you can stay in touch with the world and write your trip advisor reviews for the various restaurants you have visited in the area (as I have done). if you don't have a wifi device with you, Internet is available in reception at 1000 Rupiah per minute which works out at Â£4.00 per hour.No TV in rooms which did not bother us one bit and there is a good sized safe in every room.Whilst here, we ventured onto the beach and met a local man called OKi. He arranged a one day snorkelling trip to the 3 Gili Islands for us for around Â£20 each and yesterday, he and his friend took us on a one day tour of the West, Central, East and North of the island by car which was fantastic. OKi took us to the small remote town where he grew up and we visited his mothers tiny house in a side street for Lombok Kopi (coffee) and freshly made deep fried banana fritters. We became celebrities for an hour whilst the local children peered through the windows gasping at us as word spread that White faced westerners were in Town. We went from there up Mount Rinjami and to the waterfalls. A long day but probably one of the best days of our traveling life.Â As for the beach hawkers at Qunci. They are lovely local people, working on a public Lombok beach (no beaches in Indonesia are private), trying to make a small living on their island. They will happily barter for their goods (some of which are very nice souvenirs) and they will happily chat to you and say hello. If you don't want to buy from them just smile and say no thank you. Of course, you could always leave the hotel for a day and explore beautiful Lombok rather than fly to the other side of the earth just to sit by a pool and get upset by people trying to make a pittance of a living.In short, it HAS to be Qunci if you are intending to visit the Sengiggi area of Lombok.Â 10/10"

Simple yet stylish and practical with some lovely arty touches. This hotel is not even trying to be 5 star but has an edge that almost makes it above and beyond traditional hotel rankings. The pool is amazing, with views over the ocean, immaculately presented each day with a team if staff only too happy to help. Its all about relaxing at quncy and the happy hour cocktails are great. As for the hawkers... No big deal. They are the nicest I have met in a long time and at the end of the day everyone needs to make a living! An excellent choice in Lombok with a definite 'wow' factor. Just don't tell everyone!"

","Relaxing Villa","Commendable points on Qunci Villa:- Clean rooms- Friendly staff who greets you now and then- Staff knows English well- Wonderful breakfast- Nice setting for an awesome sunset- Surprise free fruits platter on first day- Free wifi- Clean towels- Outdoor toilet (can be a pro or con depending) Areas of improvements:- Stronger hair dryer - Perhaps can ban the beachside hawkers from selling their products at the villa's beach area- No nearby provision shops/supermarket - bring your own mineral water, tidbits, snacks before checking in. Overall a very enjoyable stay there. At first, we could not get used to having no TV at the resort, but after a short while, we began to appreciate the birds chirping and sound of waves and truly soak in the relaxing atmosphere. Would go back again."

","Wow","This place was just incredible. The staff were amazing, and nothing was too much trouble. The grounds and rooms were kept clean and tidy at all times. The food in the restaurant was of a good standard. I would happily return and have already recommended Qunci to others. It is the special little touches that make a place like this, and the value for money is great!"

","Fantastic Villas","This place is a must if you are travelling to Lombok! We stayed in the pool villas and I can't wait to go back again. The resort is located right on the beach so the sunsets are beautiful. I really can't fault anything as the restaurant, staff and facilities were amazing."

","Boutique and beautiful","This is a cute little place. we stayed at the hotel villas, rather than the pool villas - but it was great to have access to both sets of facilities. On reflection, I preferred the atmosphere at the hotel villas, it was smaller and certainly had fewer people around the pool, mainly because space there is limited - a good thing.Love the set-up of this resort too. The hotels area is quite small, but with lush vegetation and superbly priced rooms. We stayed in a garden villa, which for 85 bucks a night was fantastic value I thought. The food was good, reasonable too. However, the spa was brilliant, so much so my wife and I went every day, such is the value you get.I'd go back here in a heartbeat, as what makes the resort is the people, the atmosphere and general vibe of the place. The only slight downside is the hawkers who constantly stand in front of the hotel walls trying to catch your eye. At the end of the day though, they're only trying to do a job and they in no way enter the hotel grounds, it's all fun. Anyone who lets it get to them is obviously a little too highly strung."

","Loved Qunci and fell in love with Lombok too...","First visit to Lombok and we really loved Lombok and Qunci. Lombok is so much better value, quieter and more relaxing then BALI. We stayed in Qunci pool villas and had a awesome beach front room. The service here is fantastic, the food is great and you must try the day spa (Ask for Puji in the day spa she was my favourite) We will definitely be coming back......"

","It isn't the biggest or most expensive but it is one of the best","Check out their website and read their reviews - Qunci is terrific in all ways - across the range an excellent choice.

","Magical, breathtaking, rejuvenating","This was an amazing find and so cheap compared to what you'd pay for it's equivalent in Bali. The staff were great, the pool and beach were great. Watch out for the very persistent locals touting their wares.The garden villas had an outdoor shower which really made you feel like you were on a tropical holiday. Hotel staff (who are extremely lovely and speak excellent English) can arrange any tours for you - hop on a private boat to take you to the Gili Islands for USD65 per couple.Drinks weren't cheap, but they had 2 for 1 cocktail hour every day and who's to complain when you have an incredible sunset over the ocean each night. The food in this restaurant and its more exclusive hotel 50m up the beach was AMAZING! Be sure to specify if you want your food mild or spicy!Beautiful grounds. So quiet, so peaceful."

","Serene and Stylish - Fabulous Value","We stayed in the Villas Hotel in a Garden room (as we travel with a fairly large group needing 4 rooms and need to keep costs manageable). The Villas Hotel is slighly separated from the larger and more spacious Pool Villas, however, dont let this put you off, the ambience is identical and it has the same top quality delightful service and the rooms were actually the best we had all trip anyway. You can use any of the facilities on either property, they are only separated by a 3 minute walk along the beach.The location is good, on a very nice beach with good learner surfing and decent snorkelling, all a 5 minute taxi ride from town. Lovely infinity pool, nice to have the choice of moving out onto the beach too and braving the hawkers (but the security is ever present and the banter was always very good natured anyway).We had a great stay and highly recommend the hotel."

","Fabulous stay - should have stayed longer","This hotel was just wondeful. After 8 days in Lombok staying in plenty of basic budget hotels it was a delight to arrive here with lovely welcome drinks, fruit platter and fragrant towels to get us started. We booked a garden view in the hotel (not villas) and were upgraded to a partial sea view. The outdoor bathrooms are lovely and all very clean and tastefully furnishd. The staff are so friendly and kind and very efficient. The gardens were lovely - one morning we got up early and watched the staff cuting the grass with scissors by hand and making sure all the towels were in line with each other perfectly around the pool and evening picking off the leaves turning yellow on the trees and collecting fragipani to go in the bowls where you rinse your feet from sand. We had a fabulous lunch on the villa side but dinner was really disappointing and i suspect it was because there was a wedding on and a different chef? You just cannot beat the setting. The pools were both beautiful and I loved the chilled out music they played at a nice leve at sunset. I must admit the hawkers are a little irritating .. I was happy to buy and chat to them when I wanted to, but you could never sit on the chairs right by the sea because you would be swamped with people trying to sell you things. I think perhaps it would have been okay if the people were allowed to come and try to sell you something and then after a minute or so be asked to carry on down the beach to sell to others. Some times they just sat there for 20 minutes looking at you and calling out 'sarong' etc when you had already said no kindly many times. I felt uncomfortable reading my book and ignoring them but i had already bought so much stuff! The thing is in Lombok they are all so kind and friendly that didn't like to be mean - the solution was to sit in the chair set back away from the beach or day beds out of the view. After all everyone needs to make a living : )"

","Nice and Quiet","I stayed 2 nights from 31st mar to 2nd apr with my gf at Qunci Pool Villas (not Qunci Villas) and we booked e ""Partial Ocean View"" room. it was nice and quiet and we were given e room on e upper floor. the ground floor unit was the Garden view room. well the partial view was indeed very limited view of the ocean. however, the close proximity of the resort to the beach was close enough for us to hear the waves of the ocean splashing on the beach. the room is clean when we checked in, beautiful and aircon was good. But many ants or bugs after a day but the housekeeping does helps alot! food was nice and not too pricey at the restaurant. try their asian food. delicious! the staff everywhere was helpful and pleasant. i'd definitely return to try their ""ocean view"" room!"

","Hosted our wedding here and it surpassed our expectations!","We hosted our wedding at Qunci Pool Villas and it was not just us, but all our guests who commented on how good their experience was. We will definitely have very fond memories of our big day and this would not have been possible without the location, friendly staff, quality of food from and general ambience of Qunci Pool Villas.The staff could not do enough for us, the grounds and rooms were immaculate and the reception staff helped all our guests to book day trips if needed. The kitchen, bar and restaurant staff coped well with the pressure of a full restaurant morning and night and the wedding evening itself seemed to run perfectly.I wasn't sure exactly how the restaurant would look once converted into the evening reception venue but we were more than pleasantly surprised.My one tip for anyone thinking about having their wedding there would be to be keep it simple, be clear and organised in what you want. The venue itself is beautiful and they know how to decorate it!I think it is difficult to explain your ideal wedding to someone in the same language so you need to remember that the staff at Qunci are trying to translate your 'concepts' and themes so you may need to send a few emails back and forth to clarify this but it's worth it to have such a beautiful private wedding setting.As in a previous review i have made, i am a light sleeper so require earplugs for the 5am call to prayer that blasts across the island. I gave a pair to each guest and did not hear a single negative comment about not being able to sleep, you just need to be prepared!If you're looking for a small and intimate wedding venue (max 45 guests) where you can really feel like you have the whole place to yourself then i would definitely recommend."

","Great for Honeymooners and the Brain Dead","Spent 7 days in Qunci Pools villa hotel because of the wonderful reviews but was disappointed for a number of reasons. The friendly staff has to be asked 2 or 3 times for things like; a rack to dry swim costumes, coffee, etc. There was no TV, no Radio, no stationery, insufficient newspapers, ""library"" books only in German, The DVD player stopped working mid way thru the film, etc. etc. When it rains, what is one to do except go to bed or vegetate. The skills of a mountain goat are required to access the beach, (why not build steps?). and the walk along the beach is limited, and the sleazy town of Sengiggi is a taxi ride away. Anyone wishing to keep body and mind active would be wise to choose a different place."

","Peaceful enclave","Had a peaceful 4D3N stay at Qunci Pool Villa. I stayed in Room 33 which was on the 2nd storey. It had a view of the beach, sunset and a the verandah became my chillax place every night. A relative small and flat compound means that the staff actually know you after the first day, which was a nice touch. No TV and kettle in the room but with free wifi, it was good enough for me. :)Massage, body wraps and other beauty services are available in the hotel (I had 90min Balinese massage for USD40) but feel free to try the other masseurs along the beach (esp the ladies nearer to the hotel pool). Paid about 100,000 rupiah for a 60min session.We had an evening flight so the hotel staff was nice enough to loan us a room for a quick shower before we go. Very grateful!I loved:1) the serenity and peacefulness2) outdoor shower3) the self-sufficient resortWould be better if:1) there was food/room service available after 11pm2) more theme nights at the restaurants (there was a BBQ buffet dinner on a Thurs)All in all, I had a wonderful time.

","Affordable Luxury","I have recently returned from a 14 day stay at the Qunci Pool Villa Hotel and have to say it is one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in round the world and couldn't recommend it more. The staff were friendly and helpful and the food was excellent as well. I could only find one fault during my entire stay. We stayed in one of the 1 bedroom pool villas and although it was lovely they are sited close to the reception end of the hotel. There is a mosque very close to the hotel and we were woken by the call to prayers both at night and first thing in the morning. Had I known this was going to happen I would have booked one of the rooms nearer to the pool/beach end of the hotel as the sound doesn't carry (I believe rooms 23,28 and 29 are the ones to try and get). Although as a mainly muslim island I expected to hear this, I didn't expect to be quite as loud in the bedrooms. Even with this we had a fantastic holiday and I would recommend this hotel for anyone going to Lombok."

","Amazing Hotel and Villas","We took our family, who were visiting from the US, to Lombok for a week of sun, beach and relaxation. We decided to book Quinci Pool Villas as it had the best reviews on tripadvisor and we ended up booking the 3 bedroom lavish villa Quisa for our week's stay. To say that the villa was lavish is an understatement!! We were blown away!!! The villa, hotel, food and friendly accommodating staff all surpassed our expectations. We had two personal butlers that attended to our every need, both were so very friendly and helpful with all our questions and needs. The villa its self was stunning, and I highly recommend this to anyone who travels in groups/family. We loved having our own private pool, dining area, CHEF and space and yet we were able to utilize the hotel's amenities when needed. The spa services were relaxing and reasonably priced (we also hired a few of the massage women by the beach to come up to our villa for some pool side afternoon massages!) For many of our meals the hotel offered a private chef, at a minimal cost, to help us design our menu for each meal, highly recommend that you do this if you stay at one of the villas, the food was amazing and we gained about 10 pounds each during our weeks stay, you must get the chocolate lava cake for dessert! If you have the time, highly recommend that you take a day and explore the Gili Islands, rent a car with a driver (hotel will arrange) or rent a motor bike and hike the waterfalls around the island and go through the Monkey road!The only downside we had to our week (which has nothing to do with the hotel) was that we tried to book our own boat to the Gili Islands from Bangsal which is about a 30 min drive up north (even though the hotel offered to provide us with a boat we wanted to explore the island on our own) WARNING do not go to Bangsal EVER! We were harassed, threatened and assaulted by the local ""gang"" and when traveling with your family and young children this is not the best situation to be in. AVOID this area at all costs!!!!! In light of this incident, Qunci Hotel took the matter seriously, filing our police report and ensured that the remainder of our stay was well taken care for (having arranged for our private boat with captain the very next day!) including a personal apology from the hotel GM, Hotel Manager and Owner. We definitely appreciated that added personal touch and care and we did not let our incident damper our family holiday.Over all, I HIGHLY recommend Qunci Pool Villas and Lombok Island! Staying at this hotel and villa was the highlight of our trip!!!!!"

","Wonderful 4 days","This is the second time we have stayed at Qunci - the grounds are lush and green the service, food and surroundings are beautiful. The only downside for us, is the hawkers that hover between the beach and the pool. As much as we understand they have a right to be there, it is the calling you across the pool to your day bed with offers of ""happy hour"" prices, trying to negotiate which is rather distracting and waving the sarongs and calling you by name if you have given it to them. Rather than enjoy the peace and quiet of the location, and the wonderful views across the ocean to Mt Agung, you will see a friendly group of people waving their wares at you to entice you to buy. They are particularly persistent."

","Very memorable Valentines Day","My husband and I spent two wonderful nights at Qunci Pool Villas. We spent the morning visiting several hotels in the area and this one was certainly the best for a reasonable price. The first evening was Valentines Day. They provided a live band that set up beside the pool. There was a set menu option as well as the standard menu. The food was great! There were plenty of options for breakfast-, which was included in the room price. The room was beautiful, clean and the bathroom was open air. The outdoor space in our villa had a lovely day bed. The pool area is beautiful, overlooking a deserted beach. There is surf right in front of the resort with surfboards for rent a few steps away on the beach. We really enjoyed our stay at Qunci Pool Villas and would highly recommend it to anyone going to Lombok."

","Very relaxing holiday","I went back to Qunci Villas - the original hotel rather than the new Qunci Pool Villas - with my husband and two children under two. This was my third time (I think) going there but my first time with the family and we had a great time. The rooms as discussed here are lovely and while not the top end luxury, are very good for the price. We had the best ocean facing room at Qunci Villas right by the pool. A few things: The restaurant at the new Qunci Pool is definitely better. They have a better fish selection and more interesting Asian food options. The Quah restaurant at the main Qunci Villas is fine for breakfast and lunch but I wouldn't bother for dinner. I had a tour of some of the rooms at Qunci Pool Villas and they're gorgeous. Because it's newer, they're higher end, with bigger bathrooms and cleaner lines. They also have rooms with private pools though frankly I'm not sure it's worth it as you'll likely spend your time at the excellent main pool. Still, while Qunci Pool is nicer overall, we were still very happy at Qunci Villas as it's quieter and just a bit less hectic. We got a great rate there too that included breakfast and of course you can use all the Qunci Pool Villas facilities anyway, including the spa. If we didn't have kids, we would have gone to eat in town more. Because they are small, we ate at the Qunci properties exclusively and while it seems reasonable, everything adds up - especially with the 21% tax/service charge - and it's definitely more expensive than the restaurants in Sengiggi. Overall, I would definitely go back. Its waterfront location is fantastic and the staff are so friendly and lovely, especially the staff at both restaurants. We were treated a little like celebrities because we have a small baby and they just loved him!"

","Prefer hotel to villas","Stayed at the hotel over Christmas and moved into a villa for new year. We prefered the hotel simply becuase of the bugs/creepy crawlies and the slow service up in the villas. However both the hotel and villas are stunning, so it was a close call.The service problems were evident in both properties - in the hotel there were forgotten drinks orders, dessert never arrived, etc and in the villa it took them 45m to set up our room service dinner but they had forgotten half of the order which wasn't discovered until after the 45m! Also, the hotel is a little out of the way, don't expect to be able to walk into town easily. One last thing, the beach really needs steps from the hotel - not sure why this hasn't been installed....This sounds like a negative review but it's not, I would stay here again and the rooms and smiling staff are delicious. Also, since you are a captive audience (with the distance into town) the food, drinks and spa are quite resonable."

","Excellent views","Stayed in one of their ocean facing villas - room 27 at the pool villa side if I remember correctly - wonderful view of the ocean and Bali, falling asleep and waking up to the waves every day. Did not hear the mosque at all from where we were - and I'm a very light sleeper. (but having said that we walked over to the smaller hotel property one afternoon and I can understand why people were kept awake from the morning prayers...it really is very loud...)The volcanic sand beach was wonderful but on weekends not really accessible because it's swamped with localsBoth restaurants served really nice food at reasonable prices...one can also head over to the Puri Mas hotel ballroom restaurant next door...they have interesting cocktails and a decent dinner menu in a very nice setting entirely different to qunci...classier in my opinion. Just be careful when walking back to qunci from puri mas at night during high tide - if it wasnt for the moonlight I honestly think we needed to take a taxi for the 50m back to our room - and we almost got swept away by the strong waves while navigating through the beach back to qunci - the wife was screaming everytime the waves hit at us and lost her flip flops in the process....Also try the wood wire pizzas at the restaurant in between the 2 qunci properties.. very nice pizza but that's about all they have that's nice. Don't try anything else!...it's just not worth it. Had very good weather during our 5 days ...rained on the last 2 days and only for an hour each time. Went to Gili with Arip, one of the guides on the beach - really good guide who went snorkeling with us and saved us from jelly fish and strong currents. His charges are the same as what others have mentioned in this thread - 600000Rp for the entire day. He is a small skinny man with fairly poor complexion. The Gili trip was the highlight of our holiday thanks to Arip...if we went with any other guide it would have been a different scenario - at Gili we saw guides literally dumping their customers on the beach to ""fend for themselves""...One thing I cannot understand is how reviews on this thread mentioned that the beds were comfortable...they are most certainly not and the pillows are terrible! I'm not complaining about it because for the price you pay one cannot expect super luxurious down pillows and mattresses, I just cannot comprehend how other reviewers can say that the bed can be comfortable - it is anything but..."

","Killer Sunsets","This is the first time I travelled alone to a beach resort and may I say that it's exactly what I had envisioned!!Qunci Pool Villas may not be a huge property but it's enough for a solo traveller to occupy myself with meaningful activities like reading a book, stop and listen to the waves playing their symphony and simply breathe in the fresh air that most of us city dwellers are deprived of.I was pleasantly impressed by the staff who worked together to get the functioning of the resort at such efficiency. The security guards were helping to sweep the pool deck each morning to prepare for the day, staff dashed to the deck to clear the sunbeds once it started raining and promptly fished out all the leaves floating in the pool after the passing rain. They had to do this constantly just to keep the pool area inviting to their guests.The sunsets in my 5D4N trip was completely different from each other. And magnificent! I had a really difficult time choosing the photographs to be posted with this review. So enjoy. p/s: all my photos were taken using iPhone and the scenery beautifies the photos naturally without much efforts.Much of the aspects of my stay were reflected accurately and positively by the other reviewers so let's just put it this way. I would definitely ask my friends along the next time to experience the beauty and serenity of what Qunci Pool Villas truly represent.A big thank you for all the staff working together as a family and team to bring comfort and joy to the guests. And I must say, I'm so glad to have Murri (from the spa) to give me one of the best aromatherapy treatments just before I left for the airport. And that, sums up my near perfection experience in Qunci Pool Villas."

","A little piece of paradise","This hotel has 2 locations. The older one is Qunci Villas and the newer one is Qunci Pool Villas. We stayed at the older one which is smaller and more intimate. The rooms are very nice and because it's small, most rooms are close to the pool and beach. We had an amazing outdoor bathroom and it was like showering in a garden each time. The mosquitoes didn't seem to be a problem in the room because they provided electrical repellent that we used throughout the day and closed the bathroom door. The restaurant is very small as well. If it's fully booked, then it's difficult to find a pool chair early enough or a place to sit at the restaurant. The good thing is you have full access to their larger resort which is just a few doors down, easily accessed from the beach or street. The larger location houses a spa, full restaurant, with a more Asian menu, and a very large pool with plenty of deck chairs and space. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and we felt we were treated like VIP the entire time we were there. The hotel is in a great location and when the sun sets, there are breathtaking views. It is about a 10 min cab ride into the main part of town where most of the restaurants and bars are located but most of the establishments provide free shuttle service to and from your hotel which was very convenient. We were only there for 2 days and enjoyed the resort so much we didn't do any sightseeing on the island. I would definitely go back and stay at this hotel."

","Great getaway on the hill at Qunang","We stayed 5 nights at the hilltop private Qunang villa at Qunci with our family of four. The entire complex at Qunci is first rate, though I had a hard time envisioning the setup when organizing the trip. There are two beachside resorts, that are seperated by about 30 meters. One is older (Qunci Villas) and one is newer (Qunci Pool Villas), and you can use facilities at either. Both though are top notch facilities. In addition, there are three private villas across the road and a 5 minute walk up the hill. We stayed at the 2BR Qunang private villa and it was superb. There is dedicated butler service there (Ony and Chunc) and they rotate coverage from 7am to 11PM. We had breakfast prepared at our villa avery morning, and typically ventured down the hill for dinner. I had rented a scooter for all 4 days for buzzing around the island (highly recommend this) so I used it to get up and down to the resort, though the walk is pretty easy, and they offer a car service if you are feeling lazy. The food at the resort is very good, and selection is decent. We only went into town for dinner one night, and were not to impressed by eitehr the food or the value. We did have Christmas dinner at Jeeve Klui resort just up the road, and that was a very enjoyable experience. Qunang facilities are fabulous. Plenty of space, very clean, air con rooms and outdoor bathrooms. The pool is wonderful, there are 4 chaises outside next to it, and you can just hang there all day and be waited on if you want. A daily trip down to the pool at the resort (around happy hour !) was typical for us as it does get a bit ""lonely""up there.As far as value goes, coming from SIngapore, it seems reasonable, but by Lombok standards I am sure it is on the high end. We did have lunch at the Oberoi on day while we were out exploring, and while it is very quiet and serene (almost too much so), it was clear that Qunci offers much better value.We left on 28Dec for 4 nights on Gili T, and on the way back to the airport our last day, we again spent the day at the Qunci, swimming, eating and getting massages. We were all delighted to return to Qunci after 4 days on Gili as it was surprisingly dirty (see my review for teh ""Beachouse""under Gili T)Overall, big thumbs up for Qunci. First rate resort that you will not be disappointed in.JohnSingapore and USAPS - If you are a wine lover, Lombok will leave you disappointed. Evidently they tax wine 400% so it is prohibitively expensive, and selection is typically pretty poor."

","Amazing place to relax with family or friends","We stayed at Qunci Villas Hotel for 3 nights, I wish it was for longer we just didn't want to leave. We had a lovely private room garden view on ground floor with roomy balcony and day bed, fab open air bathroom and plenty of room for our bags. We have a 3 year old daughter and the King bed was very comfortable for all 3 of us, didn't miss having T.V who needs it when there is a stunning pool and view, divine day Spa and great restaurant and share all this with your loved ones. You don't need to leave this Hotel when you come to Lombok just enjoy the service and amenities here, we hired a scooter for 2 days had a look around the Island for a few hours the first day then didn't use the second day as all the beauty was at Qunci. I'm not sure how people can be negative about this place there's absolutely nothing negative about it, even the prayer in the morning I only heard once and that was because hubby left the open air bathroom door open even then it was quite nice and relaxing after all we are in their environment. If you are heading to Lombok don't look any further just book at Qunci the staff are Fab and friendly and you won't be disappointed, Spa is a must as well I tried the Volcanic Mud wrap so relaxing. Thank you Qunci.P.S the hawkers are quite entertaining if you are relaxing just ignore them and they won't hound you."

","Hotel Great, Sengiggi a Dump","For my family and I this was our first trip to Lombok having been Bali regulars for years. What struck us most about the area known as Sengiggi was how run down it was and how few tourist attractions there are in the area.With that background Qunci Villas is first class, from airport pick up service, check-in, villas, pool and restaurant we could find little to be disappointed with. A highlight was the exceptional staff who were incredibly attentive, friendly and helpful.The villa complex (and its neighbour separated by one block) stretches from the main coastal road located in a small village Mangsit a few kilometres north of Sengiggi, through pretty gardens to a wonderful pool and beachside cafÃ© overlooking the Lombok Strait with stunning and evocative views of Baliâs holiest of mountains Gunung Agung.We stayed in a 2 bedroom pool villa which featured a sundeck and two bedrooms with en-suites with semi enclosed showers. The beds were king size and comfortable and the en-suites are well designed and ultra clean. The small villa pool was partially secluded from the walkways by pleasant shrubs although it is not totally private.The beach side cafÃ© and pool are beautiful and provide a wonderful setting for well prepared and tasty meals featuring an Indo menu but with some western options.The beach however is narrow at high tide, volcanic black sand in texture and full of annoying hawkers constantly trying to get eye contact as you gaze at the sublime ocean views.The villa spa was pleasant and you can also have a massage under a bale on the beachfront but that does mean haggling with the hawkers.A highlight was a day trip to the Gilliâs where we snorkelled over pristine coral and swan with turtles. The trip to the islands in a tradional outrigger (albeit with a noisey Yammy outboard on the back!) was part of the fun. Touring on scooters to the North of Sengiggi along a recently upgraded coastal road was also pleasant with spectacular bay and headland vistas.As previous guests have noted there are very loud calls to prayer from muezzin squawking through a louspeaker at all hours (particularly around 4:30am in the morning) from the nearby Mosque, but donât act out your fantasy of wandering over to pull out the plug. An American has recently tried to do just that in Southern Lombok and is now serving 6 months in jail for blasphemy.Overall we enjoyed our stayed at Qunci Villas and could not fault the hotel. We do question why you would want to go to Sengiggi."

","Fantastic Location and Atmosphere, an absolute must stay place in Lombok","My partner, son and I stayed at Qunci Pool Villas for 4 nights and highly recommend it to anyone. This is an outstanding place to stay and ticked ALL the boxes for us...Fantastic service of staff who were efficient and always very friendly. Every day we got to know members of staff who were genuine and attentive and who looked after us and made us feel special.Beautiful food and gorgeous wine at good prices. We had some fantastic wine here, and the most amazing oysters. Did miss out on the Seafood Platter the first night, so just make sure you let them know what you want in advance as this is not frozen, but fresh from the local fisherman.Bigger than great service and food, Qunci has the most beautiful location and atmosphere we found in Lombok. Stunning wood and stone furniture, a gorgeous pool and gardens with the ocean lapping right in front. With spa treatments costing $40 US for 90mins we had one every day!! Snorkelling and surf on your doorstep, Sengiggi only a 5-10 minute bike/ car ride away. You really must stay at Qunci Pool Villas as it is an unforgettable experience that far exceeded my expectations. We will be back again and highly recommend it to anyone travelling in Lombok as we cannot fault it.Oh,... and did love the idea of no TV, this made us spend much more time together which is what holidays are about for us."

","Eka Culture in Hospitality Haven","What a place! The team at Qunci provide a truly magical experience in a location that delivers island ambience, teamed with unsurpassed service across all facets of hospitality. Fantastically priced, you know you are having a great holiday when you just canât have another Thai or Balineses massage, after having sensational massages daily. All staff at Qunci Pool Villas were friendly and eager to genuinely make our stay unforgettable, however special mention goes to Eka who made our stay simply fantastic. From oysters that were as big as my palm and as fresh as the ocean we looked out to while dining, to finding older vintages of french wine from the cellar, there were no bounds to Ekaâs willingness to make our stay exceed expectations. This place is easily equal to Oberoi or the Nam Hai with regards to quality and service and should not be missed. For the surfers amongst you, there is a wave out front and ramdom 10ft bombs, but as Eka would say âyouâre crazy!â Hilarious.... Big thanks to the team at Qunci Pool Villas."

","Pure Paradise!","Just a quick review to highly praise both the Qunang and Qusia Luxury Villas. We stayed for 5 nights in December and it was pure paradise. It was the first time we had booked a villa and now we are spoilt for ever more. The butlers were fantastic and did everything possible to take all the stress away - the boys (11 and 8) had an absolute ball and my husband and I actually had a holiday where we could finally chill and relax ... and read books!Both villas are just stunning ... fabulous location, fantastic food, fantastic everything. We even got used to the call to prayer early in the morning and found it strangely relaxing too (and the boys slept through it completely).We ventured out to both the Villas and Hotel and again we were nothing but impressed. The food was delicious (how lovely to be away with the boys and not to have a pizza in sight) and the staff so polite and lovely. It may not be the fastest service but this wasn't a holiday for rushing, it was one for relaxing so we kicked back and enjoyed every minute.The trip to the Gilli Isles was fabulous (favourite restaurant = Scallywags, perfectly named and again wonderfully tasty food). The trip was arranged by the butler so again no stress on our part.The spa at the hotel was also fabulous and very reasonably priced ... I had a papaya wrap which was a completely different experience!We can't wait to get out there again and would recommend it to anyone!"

","Beautiful Location Spoilt By Totally Overpriced Meals and Lack of Facilties","I have to agree with some of the other negative reviews about this so called 5 star place. As an expat living in Senggigi Lombok I had business guests arrive. They asked where was a good quality place to stay and in my ignorance(because I had never stayed there suggested the Qunci Pool Villas. On arrival we were shown to our rooms, we noticed there were no TV's in the room and asked, they said they could provide a TV/ DVD for hire if we wanted in our room so I requested the TV only to be told an hour later that there were none available(FOR THE PRICE OF THIS PLACE THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE). Next we decided to sit at the pool and have a few drinks, although beautiful surroundings we were disappointed in the time it took the staff to bring the drinks(THE PLACE WAS NOT BUSY) I thought they were making a home brew in the kitchen for the length of time it took to receive the drinks(FOR THE PRICE OF THIS PLACE THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE). After the pool episode we then went to dinner at the restaurant. Everybody ordered, myself and a business colleague asked for the Oysters on the Half Shell, 12 pieces each we requested @ Rp. 20.000 a piece, in Indonesian terms this is pricey for one piece. After a 20 minute wait we were approached by a waiter who informed us that there was only 10 pieces available so we asked for 5 pieces each as an appetizer. Another 10 minutes and he was back this time to tell us that on opening the oysters they found that they were no good or fresh. My business colleague by now was becoming annoyed, we then ordered the Asian Moon Scallops as a replacement( the waiter said he would provide a few extra because of the no show of the Oysters. On receiving our scallops, 3 scallops sat on a plate Iooking at us, what happened to the extra he said he would bring us, well it did not happen, and the Scallops were cold and for 3 small scallops for Rp. 58.000 it is not worth it (FOR THE PRICE OF THIS PLACE THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE). The next to come was the main meal, I went for the Seafood Combination Platter @ Rp.250.000.00( Again pricey in Indonesian terms), the menu said it contains, Grilled Lobster, King Prawns, Scallops, Fish Fillet and Squid with French Fries and Salad, sound nice right, well wrong let me write what it should say, 1 KING PRAWN ( WELL IF IT WAS A LOBSTER IT WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM ITS MOTHER TO EARLY), 3 PRAWNS, 2 SCALLOPS, I FISH FINGER, 1 LITTLE RUBBER SQUID, the only correct thing about this menu was the French Fries and Salad. (FOR THE PRICE OF THIS PLACE THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE). MY colleagues wife ordered the Whole Grilled Fish of the Day with a note underneath saying MARKET PRICE. Their was no menu price until the bill, the price for this unacceptable dish was R.250.000.00 which is totally incorrect. The fish was small and in the MARKET would have cost approximately between 20.000 to 40.000 Rupiah. After leaving the restaurant my business colleague and wife were so annoyed that four of us left the hotel while the other 2 stayed. So the hotel got lucky again and pocketed our money for the rooms which were not used. Overall I find that this is the worst place I have eaten in Lombok and I have been here for 3 years now, any cheap restaurant in Senggigi Lombok have what they say on the menu, as for this place it is not value for money both in service and food. Oh and by the way, if because there were no TV's available because all guests wanted them, does this tell you maybe you should put TV's in all rooms, just a thought, with the money their making from the restaurant it should not be too hard."

","Paradise with a view!","Pronounced coon-chi villas, a stunning little boutique hotel located on a beautiful strip of beach. Location couldn't be more perfect! I think it has only 28 rooms, and a few villas with private pool. The design is modern Bali-esque, with an infinity pool right on the beach. Having breakfast on tables made out of beautiful black slabs of stone, next to the pool, right on the beach with Bali's mother volcano Mt. Agung right in front of you and the waves breaking right at your feet ... well, that's paradise. And to mention that you're having a cocktail by the pool, as the sun is setting right next to Agung in the distance? It's what South-East Asia is all about! If you're staying in the rooms, make sure you ask for a room that has an ocean-view. There are also beautiful villas with a private pool ... however, no ocean view. Also, beware that there's Qunci Hotel and Qunci Pool Villas ... I'm talking about the latter, which is the one I recommend. If you're looking for a larger villa with several bedrooms, they have two beautiful villas about a 5 minute walk up the hill that are gorgeous. Perfect for a family or large group of friends."

","What a honeymoon!","My husband and I recently went to Lombok on our honeymoon and had thoroughly researched our accommodation - we were not dissapointed with Qunci one bit! We stayed in the Qunang Villa for 10 nights (November/December) behind the pool villas hotel and it was absolutely amazing. The service was impecible from the moment we were picked up from the airport. We were greeted by our butler on our arrival who was always checking that we were happy. Happy hour from 5-7pm was without a doubt my favourite time of the day - the cocktails were devine and watching the sunset whilst sitting back next to the pool with drink in hand - well it was my ideal honeymoon and we have not stopped raving about it since we got home. The restaurant at the hotel is also highly recommended although once we did venture into town a couple of times we appreciated a few more adventurous options whilst enjoying the privacy away from Sengeggi that Qunci offered. Our villa itself was just beautiful and exactly what we wanted for seclusion and privacy. The villa had amazing facilities including great sound system, television, outdoor shower, air conditioning and fully equipped kitchen out the back. We spent late afternoons laying in the upstairs sitting area on the lounge overlooking the pool and mountain. I cannot rave about this place enough - I have nothing to criticise - all staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, our honeymoon was made that much better because of them. Counting down the day until I can come back.Nat"

","This place offered almost all I wanted on my holiday.","It was the first time traveling down to Gili Island from Lombok for us. We always traveled from Bali only. So it was kind of inevitable to have a over night stay in Lombok.As usual we didn't plan our journey and went quite a few places to check out if this is the place we would like to pay.Starting from Senggigi central , we went to Sheraton(150USD), Manna Villa(300USD),Puri Mas(100USD - which I liked the most with the Lombok set up and nice price) and finally Qunci(130USD - which my partner liked).It's a very clean place with nice pool right at the beach and beautiful trunk furnitures. Also the best thing is, the staffs are really really attentive. One of the staff Echo runs a warung with his mom, selling Mee Soto(curry flavored chicken noodle soup). Give a try on real local food. They also have satay and nasi goreng next to them. All three of them are very clean and good. - We met him back at the hotel after being at his warung recommended by a local expat lady/This place had the value for the money in terms of everything. The beach is nice for beginning surfers not so much for snorkling if this helps.It was ok for me because we had a few days of good snorkling in Gili Island.BTW if you're traveling down to Gili Islands, Do not use Lombok family for your transportation. I'm not even sure if they'll show up for your return trip. And from the Gili side, they won't accept your return ticket and ask you to get refund from them when you're back in Lombok. We used them for going to Gili and the driver did his best to sell the return trip but it just didn't feel right. And on the way back from Gili we saw the sign at the harbor ticket office that they won't accept Lombok family's ticket and few other companies.If you get a chance to go to Lombok , find a way to go to Gili slands too. It's the best place to relax."

","Lovely, stylish, low key boutique","5 km outside Senggi this a great place to stay. Comfortable clean rooms, friendly but not servile staff (they even seem to like their jobs), great pool (not huge but adequate), good food.Really enjoyed my stay here especially after Bali which has become just an exercise in extracting maximum cash out of visitors for minimal service. For the time being Lombok remains blissfully different. Qunci is a good example of this attitude."

We didn't even leave the hotel the whole time we were there as it was so relaxing. The staff are fantastic, restaurant great and half price cocktails watching the sunset at 5pm every night make it even more perfect. I will definitely go back and wouldn't hesitate to recommend!"

","Great place for spa & relaxation","We stayed in the 2 bedroom Qunang Villa with private pool & free butler service. Rooms were clean & great staff services. Open concept living. Everything was great except that when darkness came, lizards starts roaming in the villa. The lizards are big!! I hate lizards so you might think I'm exagerrating but I'm not. At night, my only fear is the thought of having lizards dropping on my bed. I was frighten on a few occassions because of the loud sound made by geckos at night. The sound was so loud that i thought it's just beside me. Other than that, I'm fine with the great food, views, beaches. Don't expect to do shopping here, but hotel offers affordable spa packages.We went to Gili Trawangan & Gili Meno. I prefer Trawangan cos the beach is safer for kids to play in. Nice white sand & clear water with small waves.Food were amazing in resort. Good breakfast. We had personal chef for USD25 for 1 day where he prepared great lunch & BBQ dinner for us. We had Lobster, Calamaris, Chickens & Large shrimps for BBQ. Everything freshly chosen in their traditional market & didn't really cost us much. Overall great stay!! Will come back, but with my pest controller next time."

","Quality boutique hotel which never drops its standards","We have stayed at Qunci on three occasions now over the last 2 years and have enjoyed every visit.We find the staff extremely helpful and courteous - from reception to the restaurant, security, gardeners....all of the staff go out of their way to assist you.We have traveled around many countries in Asia as well as Europe and Qunci is without doubt excellent value for money and one of our favourite hotels.For new travellers to Lombok, if you want the equivalent of a luxury branded large chain hotel that you would find in developed tourist spots like Bali or a city break then this is not what Qunci is trying to offer and is also why we enjoy our visits here so much. If you want a high quality finished hotel with a great relaxed ambience and excellent restaurant with amazing views over the ocean - this is the place!We think it's that good we have decided to invite 40 guests(who have never visited Lombok before) to our wedding next year to stay at the Qunci pool villas and we are confident that they will all enjoy their stay.My only advice about staying at Qunci would be to bring earplugs if you are a very light sleeper. As Lombok is majority Muslim then the morning call to prayer may wake some people who are very light sleepers like myself but this is out of Qunci's control and you would experience this at any of the hotels you stay in whilst visiting Lombok unless it is very remote.Overall, great boutique resort, great service and a great price!"

","divine location will return again and again","This was our second stay at Qunci pool villas both times have been fantastic, sitting either on your balcony by the pool the view and sounds of the ocean are gorgeous.The staff are so pleasant and willing to help.The rooms are light, airy and simply, but elegantly furnished, they also have an open shower and a balconyThe king size bed is very comfortable, the rooms are cleaned each day, with fresh towels (if you choose.) Breakfast is lovely with enough choice and may be served on your balcony or at the resturant which overlooks the beach.The other meals are reasonably priced with snacks ,lunch and dinner.Perhaps more vegetarian options would be nice but i am being a little picky to mention that really ! And best of all rarely any children so it is very relaxingThe spa is peaceful and well priced you can also have a massage on the bale next to the pool by the local ladies who are quite lovely.There are some sellers but they are not insistent and add to the atmosphere.We moved on to Gili Air and were able to find transport on the beach to take us across easily . This is a paradise if you are wanting comfort and quality and a truly relaxing special holidayWe will return next year on our way to Gili Air again. Thanks to you all"

","Charming & pleasant","I absolutely loved Quincy Villas in Sengiggi...my friend and I stayed here for 2 nights after a few days in Bali, a pitstop before heading over to Gili Trawangan. It is a lovely hotel, situated right on the beach about a 20-minute drive from where the ferries land. We arrived in the morning, and our room wasn't yet ready, so we booked a 2-hour treatment in the Qunci spa while we waited. Phenomenal -- one of my favorite treatments I had during my stay in Bali, wrapping up with a flower bath in an outdoor lava-rock bathtub.We booked late, and had to switch from an ocean-front room to a private-pool villa. The pool villa had no view, but was $50 more. I'd rather have paid a premium for an ocean-view room, personally, though both rooms were lovely. There have been some complaints here about the morning call to prayer -- I actually found it quite beautiful to hear the prayers in the early-morning. I'd actually get up and go into the open-air bath so that I could hear the praying more clearly, before going back to bed.The staff was also very friendly and helpful, especially in making bookings and recommending a diving company to take us to Gili Air for a day trip. I look forward to returning to Qunci in the future!"

We stayed 13 nights.The weather was great , the rooms were very clean had everything we needed, A/C kept us very comfortable through the night. Our room was a Ocean View room at the Pool Villias. Spa was amazing, food was really good, snacks at the pool good value for money. Tours can be arranged by the staff all you have to do is ask and you will receive! Highly recommend snorkling at the Gilli islands ask for Barhram he will really look after you. We loved it so much we are going back in May 2011 can not wait."

","A lovely hotel for a relaxing break","We stayed at the quinci villas hotel in oct 2010. This place has a strong reputation, as we booked a good 6 months in advance and still could not secure a booking in the more upmarket part of this resort, the quinci villas.Overall the grounds of both sides of this resort were gorgeous and the service Devine. If you are looking for a modern designed resort then quinci is the place to be on Lombok.We found the staff exceptionally friendly and the views from the pools were great.There were a few opportunities for improvement however, the bathrooms in the ocean view hotel rooms were poorly lit and lacked much wow factor. We were also told that we could request a tv and DVD from reception but asked on all 4 days we stayed there and they were always already in use (fine when the sun shines, but when the rain comes in Lombok there is not much to do!). The praying in morning at 5pm also woke us, but reception provided ear plugs on request.Overall a lovely place to stay, the best by far we saw on Lombok and a steal for the price."

","great vibe in hip beach hotel","We recently stayed at Qunci Villas and found it to be everything we envisioned after reading the reviews. We stayed at Qunci Pool Villas which we preferred over the adjacent Qunci Hotel as it had just a bit nicer grounds and definitely a nicer pool area. However, either way you can not go wrong. The resort is esthetically pleasing and well laid out. There are always plenty of pool loungers available at any time of the day. The breakfast choices are varied and incredibly tasty and the lunch/ dinner menu is wonderful and inexpensive by western standards. All the staff is over-the-top friendly and extremely helpful at all times. The room was spacious and comfortable ( OK....beds in SE Asia are just harder that in the US, not even close to pillow top) and the bathroom was well appointed ( even though it was an outdoor bathroom, it was very private.) Our room was #23 (best room in the resort) which I would highly recommend for privacy and views. Personally I prefer the 2nd floor rooms as the ground floor rooms somewhat lack privacy. The mosque across the street was a non-issue for us as we never really heard it ( only a few times during the day...and very faint.) I was also super worried about the hawkers based on previous reviews. Again a total non- issue. There are about 5 hawkers who come by a few times a day, always the same hawkers. They hold their wares up quietly ( except for the mouthy sarong lady ;)) and do not disturb anyone. Also, the hawkers are not allowed on the property, which they respect. There are however a few minor things that would have made our stay even better ( and these things are so minor, I almost do not want to mention them.) The spa at the resort was very nice but I thought it was a bit pricey by Indonesian standards. I probably would have gone daily if it would have been just a bit cheaper. Also, the manicure was just so so. Granted, there are ""independent"" massage ladies on the beach for a lot less, but it is just not my thing. I wish there would have been more than one copy of the newspaper at the resort. They charge for internet use. Not that I care about that minor expense, it just gave me that ""nickle and dime"" feel. I wish the hotel would provide the option to purchase water shoes ( can not go into the ocean without them due to rocks and coral.) My last gripe: when we arrived there was this rock propped by the pool engraved with the words : happy hour 4-7pm ( ""written in stone"") By day three of our stay the rock was gone and the staff seemed very vague about happy hour. One staff member told us ( after we asked) that it was now from 5-7. Again, not a big deal but just weird. We absolutely enjoyed our stay at Qunci Villas and highly recommend it for a great combo of luxury and value."

","Shame about the noise","After Silk Air lost my boyfriends bag we were not in the best of moods arriving in Lombok.I expected the hotel to be more accomodating in helping us locate the bag but their English was very limited. eventually a kind lady on the desk helped us call after numerous failed attempts on the room phone.Aside from the lost bag we were very impressed with the garden view room which was always cleaned to the highest standard.they even came to spray the room every evening to avoid mosquito bites.a nice added touch.breakfast was lovely although too much for so early in the morning personally. The plates do come warm even at breakfast which was a downfall, no-one wants warm cereal!Drinks were expensive but expected in a Muslim country. The major dissapointment for me was the very loud call for prayer at 5am every morning. Be warned you will be woken up by how loud the speakers are and becomes irritating. Of course the hotel can do nothing about this but ear plugs would help have a peaceful nights sleep. There was also some maintenance work next door which woke us up at 9.The pool and views are lush and you get used to the locals trying to sell you things on the beach.they go away if you ignore them.All in all a lovely hotel and ideal location but feel the noise doesn't help for a good nights sleep!"

","Very very good","Staff - kind, helpful, polite with pretty good English. We had a problem with our room which was sorted out quickly and politely. Hotel - beautiful grounds beautifully lit at night. Excellent pool, Plenty of v comfortable sun lounger - only hotel I've been to where there are more lounger than guests which means you don't have to get up at 4.00am to reserve one. Pool service excellent. Beach - quite nice beach but not like Maldives or Seychelles - typical volcanic island beach so don't think about running into the water 'cos you'll get cut on the coral bits on the sand under the surface. Water warm and clear - 26degrees. Beach hawkers - yes, they are always there and a trifle irritating but not so bad. Worst is the guilty conscious one has bearing in mind they are just trying to scratch a living. Guests - mostly mid twenties & early thirties. French, Italian, German and English without (thankfully) tattoos, football shirts and sleeveless T shirts. Very few young children. Food - we only had breakfast and dinner. Breakfast has 7 'hot' mix and match menus. No bacon because of the Muslim thing. Strange as on Bali (Oberoi) we were offered bacon. Fruit fantastic as was the coffee - best I've had. The only real problem at breakfast was that tacky little 'portion control' containers were used for jam and butter - rather let the experience down. And no choice for jam - only strawberry. Dinner menu really good as was the food - never had dinner that was less than excellent. Just one point - all the 'hot' meals were actually only warm as the plates were never ever heated before serving. Maybe they don't do plate warming in Lombok as in other restaurants we also experienced only warm food. Wine was eye wateringly expensive. The very average Sauvignon Blanc on their menu retails in Cape Town at R$3.50 - at Qunci $39! Room - contemporary, clean, comfortable with great outdoor shower. The bed was very comfortable. Room was cleaned everyday and immaculate when we returned. The partial sea view rooms are very 'partial'. The Mosque - yes I agree with others, this was irritating as every morning at 4.30 am and at 10.00 pm the chanting would start. Diving - average with average viz. Not a patch on the Maldives. Burnt coral and a really crummy and dank disused restaurant to meet before boarding their boat. We used Lombok Dive at the 'Tourist Information' office in Seniggi. They were pretty tacky and equipment was shoddy as was their organising ability. There is a price cartel with all the dive operators i.e. $80 x 2 dives but you get could the price down to $70. Blue Manta looked the best. Having said that they organised a guide and a scooter to drive me 'off piste' to take some shots. The guide was very good. Airport - a circus disguised as an airport, especially Arrivals. Typical of a sub Saharan African experience with uniformed unsmiling staff in a sea of chaos. Make sure you have enough money for your visa as the two ATM machines were not working. The driver from Qunci came to our rescue - he was fantastic as was the hotel in organising a loan at the airport. Also make sure you have $11 in IR when you leave as there is a sneaky departure tax. Opposite - there is a laundry opposite which did a good job on our clothes. Next to it is a small shop open for a couple of hours a day where one can buy beer at a good price. A great hotel with style, amazing service, great food in a fab position and fantastic value for money. Nothing was too much trouble. This is Bali 20 years ago. I would definitely go back if the price stays reasonable."

","Paradise on earth, no place like it!","Qunci Villas was our preferred accommodation; however, was showing as fully booked online when we were making a booking, so we had to opt for our second. This turned out to be a disaster and 60 minutes after we checked in, we checked out. Took a gamble, walked down the road to the Qunci and asked if they had any available rooms. To our surprise the receptionist smiled, said yes and moments later we were whisked off to view a room. The moment we entered the room we knew we would take it. Our room was a large ground floor ocean view villa, right next to the pool, which had a huge bed, outdoor shower room, complimentary toiletries, water, and a fridge. There is no TV in room, but the receptionist kindly provided us with a TV, DVD player and even a selection of DVDs to watch, impressive. All rooms come with either a balcony or patio area, complete with a chaise and patio furniture. Nothing beats sitting on the patio, drinking Mai Tai's watching the sun go down,Heaven.The pool is not large, but is still a good size and is surrounded by comfortable sun loungers, with huge parasols. If you want to dip your toes into the sea, then the beach is a hop, skip and a jump away, no more than 20 yards from the restaurant.Whilst Qunci Pool villas does not have a spa on site, it's sister hotel, Qunci Villas, located next door does, and they give the most magnificent massages, body scrubs., manicure and pedicures. Having a treatment there is a must!Like with most hotels (except for large chains such as the Hyatt) in Bali and Lombok, the Qunci offers free Wi-Fi.Whilst we did not eat dinner at the hotel (chose to sample the delights of the numerous restaurants in town), I can definitely recommend the breakfast and lunch menus, good selection on the menu and food is absolutely scrummy.Staff are helpful and treat you as though you are the only guest in the hotel; no request is too large or small. If you're into diving then the nearby dive schools will collect you from your hotel and take you to Gilli Islands for the dive of your life. It was an absolute pleasure staying at the Qunci and I would recommend this hotel to anybody who wants a relaxing, stress free, chilled out holiday. We will definitely return."

","We stayed in the qunci hotel not knowing...","We stayed in the qunci hotel not knowing there was the pool villas as well 2 doors down. The hotel part was nice but small and the sundeck soon got busy. We used the pool villas most days to sunbathe. The pools/sundecks in both and sunset ate amazing as is the food. The rooms in the hotel were nice but basic although the views are good from your balcony. One of the best trips we took was to the Gili Islands. If you want to take a boat trip (including snorkelling) to the Gilli islands please contact Eko Suprajitno on +[-------------] or on the local beach for a great day. He can be found outside hotels wearing white t-shirt with orange writing. Eko organised a boat to take us to the islands and was our guide for a day and looked after us and showed us the best spots and manged to locate 3 turtles while snorkelling for us to see plus he knows about all the sealife and local areas and will personalise your trip to whatever you want to do."

","Qusia - Beyond our wildest dreams","We stayed at Qusia, the 3 bedroom private villa up the hill from the two main hotels and so this reveiw is for Qusia only as we didn't really use the main hotel apart from a trip to the spa which was very good (and great value) and a couple of trips to the main bar for a drink and to enjoy the views of the beach.For a special occasion or a treat do book the large villa - it is breathtakingly beautiful and worth the indulgence. We were there for 4 nights for our honeymoon. It is located across the road from the main two hotels (so not on the beach) but the villa is high up so overlooks the jungle and the sea. The hotel willingly shuttles guests to the villa but we often walked as it was only a 5 minute stroll.The outdoor living area is vast and the views and the infinity pool are breathtaking. The decor throughout is lovely and it is a very special place. It is the owner's villa so it is decorated with artwork and various artifacts and there is a good dvd collection, cds and a library.The master bedroom is very big and has a huge balcony with a day bed, perfect for lounging and an enormous bathroom with floor to ceiling windows with a huge free standing bath and the biggest rain shower I have ever seen. There are no pictures of the bathroom on the internet (that I could find) so the bathroom was a really shock (a nice one) when we saw it. There is another double room with a balcony and a good bathroom, the third bedroom is a twin. The other bedrooms are in two different buildings within the villa complex so this would be a good place to stay with friends or as a family. The villa comes with a butler (2 butlers who split their shifts) and a chef and the butlers looked after us really well. In the morning there are also pool attendants and cleaners who clean the villa before you really surface. It was quite comical one morning to realise we had one chef, a butler, a pool attendant and 2 cleaners. That said after about 11 am you have the place to yourself and the butler keeps a low profile unless you ""need"" him.I've read the other reviews and yes you can hear the Mosque during the day and at sundown. However we kept all the doors and windows closed at night and only heard prayers once during the morning (my husband didnt hear it at all) and I am a light sleeper. So at the villa it wasn't really a problem.We took breakfast every day outside. For lunch and dinner you can eat at the villa either off the main hotel menu or you can pay extra and the chef will do his own menu for you. We did this on our last day and it was better value for the day overall if you have lunch and dinner - it was $25 dollars for the chef for the day and he did lunch and a BBQ dinner for us (which was what we requested). We chose what we wanted to eat with his help the night before and the chef went to the early morning market to buy our food which for the day came to about Â£25 in total. Thus for under Â£50 we had our own chef and a huge lunch and lovely BBQ. We could have gone to the market with him but decided to laze by the pool instead.We booked a trip to the Gili islands via the hotel as we didnât know where to go direct to book it. It was well worth the trip (although I'd say the snorkelling was good but not amazing). This was the best place we have ever stayed at and I could not fault a thing. We did not want to leave."

","One of the best","We stayed at Qunci Villas as part of our honeymoon and we had the best time there. This was actually the cheapest of 3 honeymoon hotels and we didn't expect ... but when we got there we were blown away. The resort is great and staff is even better. Somewhere in the resort booklet it says the tag line 'consider it done' and that's so true.I can just highly recommend this place and am hoping to be back there very soon.THANKS to Qunci and the wonderfull staff for a truly wonderful honeymoon."

","Overrated- 5AM wakeup every morning is absolutely brutal","Quinci Villas consists of two separate beachfront plots of land that are separated by about 100 meters. The villa portion is larger and appears newer, while the hotel room portion is still well maintained, but a little tired. We were very excited for our stay here after reading the many positive reviews, but we were very disappointed. We stayed in an Ocean view room. It was a simple room with a balcony and bathroom. There was no furniture to store clothing, so we were living out of our suitcases. The room was nice, but simple. We had to pay for our transfers because we booked our stay through a third party website. The biggest negative was the noise. At around 5am every morning before the sun comes up, we were awoken by the prayers from the Mosque next door. I had read the reviews so I heard about this previously, but I figured that I currently live near the ground floor in the middle of NYC so I would have no problem with this. I was sorely mistaken. The Mosque is about 50 m from the Hotel portion and has speakers that blast the prayers on and off from about 5am to about 7am. There is no way to sleep while this is going on. Now I don't expect the hotel to have any control over local houses of worship, but they should consider some sound proofing or at least provide some ear plugs (we asked, they did nto have them). I imagine this problem is better at the villa portion as it is further away. It's also probably better at the cheaper garden view rooms, because they are lower and more protected from the sound. We chose to book two activities at separate times through the hotel. It costs more than other operators, but we figured going through the hotel would be easier and more convenient. However, both times when we showed up for the activities, they had no record of the reservation. The staff was very helpful in then hustling around to set it up, but in both times it meant about 20 minutes of wasted time sitting in the lobby. I don't want to be all negative though as we did have a nice stay in Lombok (ideally I probably would have given 2.5 stars). The staff at the hotel was very friendly, and very helpful. This was the high season and the hotel was booked fully (I know because we tried to change rooms) , so I think they were understaffed to handle the influx of visitors at the time. The location overlooking the ocean is beautiful. We ate at the restaurant at the villas and hotel, and the food at both was excellent. There were some beach vendors hawking goods and massages, but I found them respectful and friendly so I was glad the hotel didn't do anything to chase them away. I did not get a chance to see inside the villas so I can't really speak about those. Because the reviews are so high I have to assume they are much better, or Quinci is very good at manipulating Trip Advisor."

","Great place with a ""few scratches in the paint""","We enjoyed our stay at QV, approachable personell, good food, beautiful location. But still room for improvement - no pick-up at the arranged time, when driver finally arrived after I called the hotel we had to drive the opposite direction for 25min to put gaz. Upon arrival we were told our room would be ready in an hour - it took 3. We booked a relatively expensive car for an island tour - it came late and without any seatbelts for the kids (we had to wait another hour before one with seatbelts came and then a smaller car. In any of the above cases where any compensation given - but I guess you can get a long way with smiles and apologies. Room was nice but ours had an A/C problem which hotel didnt manage to fix during our 3 nights stay. Food was really good but expensive especially given the amount served (i.e. very small portions). If you can live with these small inconsistencies it is a really nice place with really wellkeept surroundings. Try to get rid of all the beach sellers calling you out when lying at the pool."

","The reviews are true!","We stayed at Qunci Villas for 4 nights in a garden villa. This area is smaller and more like a high quality boutique hotel than the larger Qunci Villas property which is 2 properties down the road.The level of staff service was very good and the ambience was great. The food provided at the hotel restaurants is very good and slightly more expensive than the restaurants you can find in Senggigi.If you want to take a boat trip (including snorkelling) to the Gilli islands please contact Eko Suprajitno on +6281805711190 or on the local beach for a great day. Eko organised a boat to take us to the islands and was our guide for a day and looked after us and showed us the best spots and manged to locate 3 turtles while snorkelling for us to see. His rates are reasonable and were around 600000 Rp for the day.If you feel like hiring a board and surfing out the front of the resort (smaller waves only) then see Abdul (contact 087865592891) who also can organise surfing trips to other places in Lombok.We would love to return to stay at this wonderful hotel in future."

","In Love with Qunci","What can I say ? My first trip to Lombok was made truly enjoyable, thanks to Qunci. The staff especially are warm and friendly and always with a smile on their faces. We stayed in an ocean view room at Qunci Pool Villas, 4 steps away from the main pool. I had emailed Qunci weeks in advance for a TV in the room, which came without programs but attached to the DVD player, you can request for dvds from reception. Wi-fi is free so feel free to bring your laptop, good idea especially when it rains and there's nothing much to do. We were initially disappointed upon checking in and not seeing any coffeemaker but were pleased when our request for one and bedroom slippers were accommodated. We weren't bothered much by the vendors on the beach, they weren't as persistent as what some reviewers made them out to be. We made small talk with them, but they were friendly enough to move on without pushing for a sale.I rate the food at Qunci (Quali Restaurant) highly although there were a few hits and misses. The banana flower salad and grilled seafood combination at dinner were just superb but the seafood soup at lunch the next day was a letdown (too watery).The breakfast toast and mie goreng were rather on the salty side. (Don't know if the hotel notices this but I saw many untouched pieces of toast from other guests when the staff cleared the tables, could be they found them salty too) A lot of thought had been put into preparing the food, everything was aesthetically pleasing, what a delight to the senses, And the service ? Outstanding. I had a peek at the hotel next door, Puri Mas, which has a more traditional Indonesian decor but I'm glad I made the right choice by staying at Qunci with its hip, modern design. The outdoor rain shower is fabulous, only available if you stay on the ground floor. The gardens are beautiful and well-tended (they grow lemongrass, did you know? ) The beach in front of the hotel has black sand and at low tide, it's littered with dead corals so wear your booties, which I did. Since the beach is not private, you may find the locals surfing in the water or just hanging out by the beach, in close proximity. If there's one thing I'd love Qunci to add, it would be a full length mirror in the room. Currently, there's only one above the sink in the bathroom and that only shows one-half of the body, waist-up. Oh well, maybe it's not important for some people but I think women generally tend to want their creature comforts like a full length mirror to see if their dresses match their shoes, etc.All in all, I had a great time and will tell all my friends and clients how wonderful Qunci Pool Villas is."

","long overdue review...i guess there is no keeping it a secret!","So my review will... in October this year... be a year overdue - perhaps subconsciously I wanted to keep this absolute gem resort to myself ;-) but Quinci deserve the most glowing reviews and I couldn't just not give one, even though there is not much I can say that hasn't been said already. Apart from I cannot believe this place isn't rated no. 1 on trip advisor! For those that havenât rated top marks â take a look at yourself, are you one of âthoseâ people â thereâs always one! This is not a 5 star chain resort â itâs a unique boutique hotel, you get idiosyncrasies, but you also get much more than a room number! For the rest of you, you probably have a good idea already - this place is heaven on earth - treasure it and only share with those that deserve it! :-) And for what you pay â good lord how many horses do you want to look in the mouth! The resort is just fabulous: the food divine and reasonably priced, the setting the true meaning of beautiful - I tried mesmerising it in the last few days and those images are now my 'happy place'. The pool is just glorious, the spa offers the most beautiful relaxation and the staff throughout are just so so lovely. This place makes it impossible when you look for other holidays to find somewhere comparable. It really was the most relaxing and romantic trip I have ever had, and I have been fortunate to travel A LOT!We actually stayed for 10 days, which with our busy work careers we needed for the rest so we werenât too active or desperate for lots of activities. We visited Singapore friends for a few days either side so this was the 'relaxation pieceâ of the holiday after lots of fun, late nights and long activity and shopping in Singapore (which I love!). Over and above what the resort offers, we went to the local town one night (Senngigi) - good to see but to be honest not what we were after. We went snorkeling to the Gillis which I would highly recommend - go to Eddie on the beach direct (he is who the hotel use after taking their cut) and you can recognise him by seeing my picture on the boat above. We asked how much if we'd gone direct and it was about a 1/3rd of what the hotel charged - they have to make their cut to be fair. In any case it was the BEST snorkeling of my life, I've done Caribbean, Egypt etc this was still by far the BEST! We swam with sea turtles and stroked them (v emotional for me!) and saw/ were surrounded by, more fish that I would ever believe possible - so vibrant and beautiful, Good advice? Don't forget your suntan lotion, and a long sleeved lightweight shirt to swim in to avoid burning! and sun-block for your bottom ;-) and we also did the couples romantic dinner - yes corny - but hey we soon forgot there were other people at the resort...there was WAY too much food (wasteful) and the white wine was awful BUT the ambience...romanceâ¦mmmmm. And after dinner a lovely lie on the bed next to the table listening to the waves and watching the stars. On that note â there is v little to do in the evenings so generally you make your own entertainment!We had many visits to the spa which while more expensive than the ladies on the beach with oil bottles won wholeheartedly on the ambience, materials and setting. The coconilla scrub is to die for. They scrub you with fresh grated coconut and milk then massage you and end with a flower bath (sprinkled with flowers and smelling sweetly)and ginger tea which you can share with partner if they too have a had a treatment which is especially lovely at night when candlelight - so so exquisite - I don't think my skin will ever feel that good again. The coconut milk bath is another one to go for - bliss! The reflexology also highly recommended. I also had a body wrap and felt like I was floating as all the 'bad stuff' left my body.All you need is your bikini, your loved one and Quinci will do the rest! Oh and ladies - don't even think about taking sarongs - Â£1.50-3 for gorgeous ones. And pearls on the beach, I bought necklaces for max Â£10 each (even though they started at nearly 10x that! be firm esp. if buying in bulk!)Bad bits: the hawkers are the only thing that lets the resort down - having said that be firm and they will stop pestering you quickly.We will 100% be returning to Quinci villas - maybe we'll see you there? :-)"

","Would have rated Qunci 3.5 stars but I can't so I'll top up to 4 instead","Maybe my expectations were set too high from reading the reviews here but I wasn't completely bowled over by Qunci Villas. It is a lovely, relaxing resort but I wouldn't say it's breathtaking. However it is extremely good value for money - you'd definitely pay more for something similar in Bali or at other 5 star resorts in Lombok. We stayed in the ocean view room at Qunci Pool Villas. We were in room 28 and that along with room 23 have the best views (in my opinion). The view was fantastic from a generous balcony overlooking the pool and beach - we had some gorgeous sunsets. It was also very calming to wake up and watch the waves roll in. The room itself was a little tired-looking though, the floors looked a bit stained and the wood a bit worn. But overall it was clean and comfortable. It would've been nice to have an ipod dock in the room since there is no TV. Always good to have some music to add to the ambience. Luckily I brought little travel speakers with me.I enjoyed the food at the restaurant and I loved happy hour! One for one cocktails from 4pm to 7pm everyday. Fantastic way to unwind while watching the waves roll in. They had a good selection for breakfast which you can have delivered to your room. However I felt service at the restaurant was a bit slow. It seemed to take ages for our food to be served even when there were hardly any customers in the restaurant. Staff seemed a bit forgetful, I'd have to ask for milk/water/cutlery two or three times before they remembered. And more than once (I stayed here for 5 days), I would sit at a table which hadn't been cleared and when the staff cleared it, they wouldn't clear the paper placemats even if they were soiled, and they would forget to give us cutlery. The staff are generally friendly and keen to help but I did encounter some issues. The soap in our shower wasn't replaced after 3 days even though it was a sad little lump in the soapdish. And our transfer to the airport was meant to come at 5pm but didn't rock up till 5.30pm. The up side was I got to spend less time in Lombok airport but the down side was I am an anxious flyer and I prefer to be at the airport earlier. That said, it was my first trip to Lombok and I absolutely loved it so I will definitely be back."

","Great...but room lighten up a little","We stayed at three resorts during our trip to Lombok. The Quinci was the first we stayed at, and all in all it was a really nice place to holiday. The rooms are large and better than both the Alang Alang and the Novotel Lombok. The resort is on quite a small plot, so the accommodation does seem very close together. The restaurant was nice, and I will always remember dinner on the beach...fantastic.The only thing I can comment on is the staff. I think they have been extremely well trained to do their jobs...in fact even a little too well, if that is possible. For example, the pool attendant putting the pool towels on the lounges in the morning, would take a long time to sight them all, so they were all 100% in a row. The place felt like there wasn't anything out of place, which almost became disturbing...if a leaf fell in the pool while I was swimming, i almost felt compelled to go over and remove it. Maybe it's just me, or an Australian point of view, but I think the staff could be given some lattitude to lighten up a bit, and not seem so process driven. I found the staff at Alang Aland better for this very reason.The only other negatives were the call to prayers every morning from the mosque, and the crowing of the roosters. I'm not sure which started first, but both made sure I was woken early every morning. We had a room near the road, and this problem may not be so bad if you have on closer to the beach.A really nice boutique resort though, would definitely recommend it to others."

","Beautiful, peaceful, amazing value!","My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights in June/July 2010. We stayed in a partial-ocean view villa, which was all that was available when we booked. While we were initially disappointed to not stay in a full-ocean view villa, we were pleasantly surprised by our room, which offered much more privacy than the full-ocean view villas. We had breakfast (included in the room rate) served daily to our balcony (alternatively, you can eat it in the restaurant), which was lovely. While the beach is small, the pool deck is paradise, with the option to swim out front in the ocean or in the gorgeous pool. There are also fun, playful waves right out front of the hotel, and locals rent surfboards and offer surf lessons. Still, it is not difficult to swim past the waves and enjoy some calm swimming. Qunci offers a buy one-get one happy hour from 4pm-7pm, an ideal way to enjoy the beautiful sunset from the deck (and when the clouds cooperate, you can see Bali!). Through the hotel, we organized a day trip to the Gili Islands, which are a 45-minute boat ride away, and we had a fabulous time snorkelling (the sea turtles were a highlight!). In addition to breakfast, we ate one lunch and one dinner at the hotel (on Thursday nights, the hotel offers a seafood bbq with live music), and the food was good, but be sure to venture out to the restaurants in Senggiggi (about a $2 cab ride away) -- we especially enjoyed Square Restaurant and Asmari. The ONLY downside to our stay were the mosquitoes in our room, which were particularly bad one night after it rained. Because the bathrooms are open-air, going in and out of the bathroom easily allows mosquitoes to sneak into the room. Still, this was not enough to detract from our overall satisfaction with Qunci (despite seeing a number of mosquitoes in our room, we were quick to kill them and didn't get bitten once!). Plus, the hotel is doing everything it can to deal with the bugs -- they regularly fog the grounds and spray nightly in the rooms. Overall, Qunci offers incredible value for your money, in a beautiful, peaceful setting, with easy access to the main attractions of Lombok. The staff is also friendly and accommodating. After leaving Qunci, we spent 3 nights at the Novotel in south Lombok and wish we had stayed the entire week at Qunci. Stay at Qunci, and you won't be disappointed!"

","The most amazing place we have ever been to!","We stayed at Qunci for 4 nights as part of our honeymoon and had the best ever experience! The breakfast is absolutely amazing and the service here is second to none. The whole place is impressively clean and is kept in great condition. We have to recommend room 23 where the views are something else, we sat on the balcony for hours just soaking it all up! The outdoor shower was great and definately something everyone should experience in life!! We would like to say a massive thank you to everyone at Qunci who made our stay so special and especially for the honeymoon decorations that we absolutely loved! I have never seen so many orchids all in one place!To sum up Qunci in one word we would say... Perfection!!!"

","Soliciting and loitering are just blatantly allowed!","Yes, great villas, decent food. But how can you enjoy them when there is ALWAYS somebody bugging you about buying sarong, DVDs, massage, souvenirs. The worst is you just don't get any help keeping this at bay -- the staff just don't even pretend to try to keep these guys from bugging you. You don't even get to enjoy the view of the ocean -- they are like a cordon on the beach. Here's an example: it starts to rain so I retreat from my chaise from the rear of the pool to covered cabanas (bale) next to the beach. All the hawkers RUN to the bale themselves. The security guard is also there. I tell the security guard ""These guys are on hotel property, please ask them to go"", he just waves his hand, says something about the rain! So imagine me, in my bikini, laying on the bed, with 20 muslim men sitting around me, not only can I not see the ocean from them, but some of them just casually lit a cigarette and I was so obviously pregnant at that time! And then they start ""Massage, maybe"" !!!Other downsides: -mosquitoes-the food could be better -- the balsamic seared tuna is still the highlight of their menu (it must be several years old now given that it was in my lonely planet). I really wanted to like this place. It was the most expensive place and I gave up checking the south end of the island just to stay here. Was disappointed! The service can try to do better by their guests!"

","The best hotel I have ever stayed in anywhere in the world","An absolute haven. Beautiful grounds, an amazing view (we stayed in an Ocean View room, number 28), wonderful staff, a spa that was amazingly good value and the treatments were sublime, very few mozzies, fantastic food and the most beautiful sunsets night after night.I can honestly say that I am not able to fault this hotel in any way. Everything was perfect and we even stayed an extra two nights as we did not really want to leave! I would highly recommended this hotel, especially if you are looking for somewhere which does not have too many children in residence.Tips:If you can afford the little bit extra then definitely take a room at the Pool Villas site rather than the main hotel - the pool, restaurant and grounds are much nicer.For lunch ask for the Finger Food menu. We were only made aware of this on our 4th day but it is much cheaper and offers smaller dishes to the main menu which works well in the hot weather.The restaurant is quite expensive (by Indonesian standards at least) but you get what you pay for and the food is extremely good. Take advantage of the bar happy hour as this will save you a lot of cash, although be aware you need to actually be served the drinks within the time frame, they will not keep them back for you even if it is the last one of a pair and you are only just outside of the slot. As far as the 21% tax, it's the norm and most restaurants charge it, it is like service charge over here with 11% going straight to the government (especially the ones at this level) you just need to remember to factor it in.Nothing to do with the hotel but remember when you leave Indo you have to pay a departure tax (on top of the entry visa on the way in) of 150,000 IRP each so make sure to keep some cash on you for that."

","A Little Slice of Paradise","I arrived for a 2-night stay with my wife, and was overwhelmed by the welcome we received. From the personalised check-in, to the welcome cocktail, to the flowers arranged in a heart shape on the bed and strewn around the room, this was a welcome guaranteed to put us in the holiday mood.I had a private pool villa with outdoor bathroom for a fraction of the price you would pay in a similar-standard resort in Bali. Decors are minimalist chic, with local touches in the form of sculptures and paintings used in the villas. The real attraction of Qunci, though, is the infinity pool facing the limitless expanse of the Indian Ocean. You can have breakfast on tables set up facing the sea, and one has a choice of American, Continental or Archipelago (Indonesian) breakfast.Staff were charming and seemed genuinely happy to serve. Having checked in late due to the scheduled late arrival of our flight, Qunci was happy to extend us a late checkout till 4 pm. All in all, Qunci provides a value-for-money experience and shows that you don't have to charge the moon to deliver a little slice of paradise."

","It was even better than our 1st honeymoon","I have mixed feeling when I return to work today. Part of me wanted to share the experience with others and the other part says I should just keep it to myself so that QPV remains as our private retreat. :-)I was so looking forward to this trip ever since reading the reviews here and we just came back last night. Simply put, by the 2nd night there, my wife and I have decided make QPV and Lombok our annual retreat if we can. I can really find faullts on anything and it was just perfect for us. From the airport transfer, checking in, the surprise romantic dinner for my wife, Qamboja Spa, the food and of course the the amazing people of QPV. My advise is if you plan to venture Lombok, you need stay there more than 5 days. Othwerwise, just sit down and enjoy what they offer in QPV which is ""peace of mind"". We stayed in the One bedroom Pool Villa for 2 nights called Qingrass and the Partial Ocean Sea View on the last night. The only difference to these rooms are actually the private pool and the larger bathroom. For the Partial Ocean View, we stayed at the upper unit which is actually our preference. I think it offers a better view (although limited) and it offers more privacy so that you dont get people passing by your villa every now and then although in QPV you actually hardly see any people moving around. There are no TV in the room but they can provide you with a TV and a DVD player so that you can bring your own disc to watch, in case watching movies is a must for your holidays.For the highlight of the stay was watching the sunset with the view of Mt Agung on our last evening there. Thanks QPV for everything and please do not change anything about the resort. Counting my days now until my next trip there."

","AMAZING!!!!","My husband and I spent 9 nights at Quinci Villas, and it was one of the best holidays we've ever had! We flew in from Bruxelles, Belgium for a relaxing holiday. Full of curiosity and excitment, as this was our first time in SE Asia. To our delight, everything exceeded expectations. The resort, even though enjoys very pretty pictures on their website, it is actually a lot nicer in reality. We were impressed with the careful attention to detail not only in the architecctural design of the hotel, but also the landscaping, the choice of materials, the music, and more generally the ambiance created. Celarly, somebody thought through every detail, invested soul and beauty, and I think this makes this place so much different than many other 'tropical resorts' we vacationed before. But, what won our hearts most, was the excellent service, and the very kind, polite and hard working nature of the people. It was really refreshing to be surrounded by people who constantly smile, and seem so genuinely happy to make you feel welcomed. I loved that this came naturally, and not like a 'commercial duty' learned in some training - 'you have to smile to please the client' sort of thing. I can go on and on praising this place. Ah, and of course the Ocean, the diving/snorkeling is wonderful! The best compliment probably comes from my husband, who is eager for us to go back to Lombok soon. He normally doesn't like to go back to the same place twice; and neither do I. But we would like to return, this time, to hike Mount Rinjani. We'll most likely stay at Quinci Villas again. And if the manager, reads this post, as I thought I saw him doing on one of the terraces at Quinci Pool Villas, while we were there, big congratulations for the two resorts!! If I have a recommendation for improvment - please change the pillows with some that are softer and more pleasant :-)) Other than that, we give you a big thumb up and look forward to returning!"

","Boutique wonderland","Qunci pool villas is a sensory delight inspired with artistic touches, gorgeous rooms and sublime pool area and outlook.We had a one bed pool villa which was well appointed and a nice retreat when you felt like getting away from it all. The hotel area was just as special with good food and service in a spectacular oceanside setting.The main pool restuarnt area is a romantic setting with candles completing the atmosphere. There were always lots of staff to attend to our needs with cocktail hour being a nice time to enjoy the sunset and mix with other guests. Qunci also organised a driver to take us to Kuta for the day. There was a little surf break right in front of the resort to enjoy.I recommend this resort as a beautiful experience to enjoy, you won't be disappointed!"

","Beautiful Villa with excellent service","My husband and I decided to reserve this villa soon as we see the pictures. We are so delighted to find the Villa looked more beautiful than the pictures. We took the Standard Garden View room for 1 night. However, due to emergency, we have to fly back to Jakarta, and we only stayed for 6 hours. But the memory remains unbelievable. I called the staff to have early checked-in and it was really surprising that they're willing to help you to find any available room (cos our room is not ready yet, we checked in at 6 am). We finally stayed at the Standard Sea view Villa. The room is clean and very calming. There's no TV, but who need one when you have the sea to watch. The only downside is, I did not find any restaurants around the area, but you can get a Bluebird taxi or Bemo to catch a 5 minutes ride to the restaurant area. Just ask the front office staff, they'll help you with this. Overall, the staffs are very professional, they greed you by your name and they surely going to take care of you during the stay. Definitely the place for honeymooners."

","5 star location, 4 star room and 3 star service","My wife and I stayed at Qunci Villas on the last leg of our honeymoon. We had previously been to the Samaya and Komaneka in Bali as well as the Grand Sanford in Hong Kong (see separate reviews). We had already enjoyed the best service and some of the most luxurious rooms ever so coming to Lombok and staying at another 5 star retreat we were expecting nothing different. Upon arrival we were greeted by smiling staff but after that the actual service always seemed to fall flat â since we arrived early they said we would have to wait for our room to be cleaned which is fair âbut there was no offer of a room to get changed after our flight from Bali and after waiting in the reception area without anyone really acknowledging our presence we practically had to beg to get a temporary room just to get changed. In the end when we arrived at our proper room (we were staying in one of the pool villas) the rooms were very minimalist and contemporary. There is no TV and the bathroom is outdoors, there is also no in house safe and you have to use the safe which is in the reception â none of these are necessarily bad but could be a hindrance for some people. The hotel itself is set on a beautiful part of the coast with a lovely infinity pool you can easily relax by the pool and watch the day go by with a view that will truly take your breath away. The hotel restaurant was nice but again the service wasnât up to the usual 5 star quality that you would expect from hotels of this calibre in the Far East. We tried the spa a few times which again like the restaurant was good but not 5 star good. For the Muslim traveller the whole country operates under a halal banner and there is no pork or non halal meat at all â even though they still do serve alcohol but only in hotels and restaurants. There are plenty of restaurants around to visit and also plenty of mosques so you will be spoilt for choice. A word of warning that all the rooms do have large paintings with faces on them so for praying this can be difficult, I couldnât find a way to take them down also!In summary â despite seeming like a negative review I did like this hotel a lot especially as for the price you pay you do get a lot, but I felt let down by the service which would have put it on par with other 5 star luxury hotels in Bali, but I guess so far in Lombok your choice is between Qunci Villas and The Oberoi and at a fraction of the cost you canât go wrong with the Qunci Villas if you are willing to put with the minor foibles of the hotel service and concentrate on enjoying the wonderful views!"

","Romantic, Relaxing, and Amazing!","The Qunci Villas is heavenly and the spectacular service began with the polite, but quite, person who met us at the airport. Our villa with a private pool was comfortable, fashionable (even artistic), and reinvigorated our spirits and relaxed our minds. The food was excellent. The drinks were tasty. The service was always attentive but unobtrusive. The outdoor shower seemed odd at first (I'm a bit shy), but it turned out to be one of the lovely parts of the experience. It was one of the best vacations we've ever had, bringing us closer together after many years of marriage. I highly recommend this little jewel on a beautiful island."

","Dreaming of being back at Qunci Villas","I had an all-around fabulous experience at Qunci Villas starting at the pre-booking stage. I was going during peak season but the staff was extremely friendly even though I pestered them quite a bit to find the type of room that I wanted for the dates that worked for me.My girlfriend and I were flying through Bali and Qunci even helped me figure out the flight schedule from Bali to Lombok and gave me tips on which airline to fly. When we arrived in Lombok, they had sent a comfortable car to the airport to pick us up. The driver was extremely friendly and helped me find a place to rent a motorcycle which is usually not available for rent on Lombok Island (for a perfectly reasonable rate). In fact he even went to the place and picked up the motorcycle and brought it to the hotel.At the hotel the service was absolutely fantastic and the staff went out of their way to cater to our needs.As for the ""hard product,"" everything is what you would expect and more. The landscaping at the facility is very pleasant and does a good job of separating the rooms a bit to create a better sense of privacy. The rooms are spacious and well-built for the most part. They aren't 100% closed off though so there is some outside noise you can hear (I'm a light sleeper and it didn't bother me enough to keep me up or wake me up). The pool is a very nice place to chill out and take in the amazing sunsets over Bali. We only had our breakfasts at the hotel and while the menu was limited, the food was pretty good.All in all, Qunci Villas is a fabulous place to stay, especially given the price that you are paying for the accommodations. A similar villa would cost significantly more in Bali."

","I wish I lived here....","We were met at the airport, late at night, by a driver for the hotel. My first trip back to Lombok since 1984. Back then, there was just one empty hotel, and Sengiggi was a village. On getting to Qunci Villas, we were welcomed with a cold drink, and checked in in a couple of minutes. The staff were superb, as they were every single day. Breakfast was delivered to us every morning. The food was superb (and I know Indonesian cuisine inside out) and a great value. When management is ""invisible"", you know a hotel is well run. Not once did we see anyone being told what they had to doâthe staff are one of the best things about this placeâgenuinely friendly, and actually interested in their guests. It is a matter of personal pride for them, in my opinion, to ensure that the guests are well looked after.The attention to detail in the design of the place is really outstanding. As a designer myself, I look for rooms and spaces that are well thought out and intelligently appointed, and Qunci Villas is exceptionally well designed, down to the smallest detail evenâI was looking at how the deck chairs by the pools were built, at sight lines, at lighting, at use of colour, you name it.. A lot of thought went into Qunci Villas. It is the most enjoyable place I have ever stayed, and having travelled from the high Arctic to South East Asia over the last 30 years, I have stayed in a lot of places. Qunci Villas is outstanding. I wish i could buy shares in it.Take a look at these photos. You know what youâre looking at, but keep in mind what youâre NOT looking atâhordes of lobster-coloured inebriated tourists, never-ending line-ups for mediocre buffet food, screaming children urinating in the pool, embarrassing âactivitiesâ like dance lessons and sleazy, sexist drinking games, no inane Disney characters, and not a single person with a bubba-mug full of cheap rum at 10 AM. Qunci Villas is an oasis, on every level."

","The Best Kept Secret in the World ...","My family and I traveled to Lombok in July 2009. We were so awestruck with our entire trip that we are still talking about it and will for some time to come. The staff at Qunci Villas is by far the best we have ever met. They remembered our names from the start and were most helpful and courteous at every encounter. The lovely atmosphere of the villa and the surrounding beauty was absolutely the best. We were never without a drink in hand, advice and help at the asking, a ride whenever we needed, and the staff even helped us rearrange a very complicated itinerary with our flight back to the US. Always with a smile and respect. The villa itself is situated along the beautiful coastline. There are tables and lounges to relax the day away. The rooms are quite spacious and spotless! Whenever we were out the staff would tidy up immediately and make sure our every need was met. The food was delicious and the service beyond reproach.We had the privilege of meeting the proprietor and were quite impressed with his overall concern for our comfort and stay. He even arranged a trek up Mount Rinjani for our family and a day trip over to do some snorkeling. Very classy.Qunici Villas is like a piece of heaven. Our daughter called it ""the best kept secret in the world"". We have and will continue to recommend this amazing place to all our friends and family. We can't wait to go back ..."

The Bathroom amazing and beautifully decorated and clean. spotless every day we were there.2nd day room service top notch!! on time and well presented, who can say no to the bannana pancakes with syrup, fresh juices, croissants, roll on the pounds.!!!!!.At night we were presented with a special meal on behalf of the hotel(lovely suprise)Nasi Tumpeng one of the best meals Ä± have ever tasted, so much so that Ä± asked the waiter to write down all the ingredients which he very kindly obliged by doing so, I just wish Ä± learnt how to cook it!!! but maybe next time.Every day we were there, it just got better and better, beautiful pool, fabulous staff, always with a smile and very helpful, nothing too much trouble for them.From the minute you check-in all the staff seem to know your name.which is a beautiful touch.We travelled all over the island booked the hotel driver which was amazing.attempted to eat a couple of times in sengiggi De Quake was very good, and yessy cafe very good.But for us nothing beats the presentation and quality of the quinci restaurants, so ate mostly there, and was never dissapointed.Happy hour or hours 4-7pm is marvellous certainly tried all there cocktails, for me honeymoon lombok does it..........Ä°f you are hardworking like we are, and need to get away just relax and enjoy being pampered 24/7 Quinci will not fail you.Ä°ts hard we know to please everyone, but all the staff and management certainly give there very best to do so.Will definately go back at the earliest opportunity.Thankyou for 8 days of HEAVEN.."

","THE HIGHLIGHT OF OUR HOLIDAY!","Our stay at Qunci Villas hotel was definitely the highlight of our holiday. Who says that it is hard to find a decent place to stay as soon as you go East of Bali, unless you are ready to pay for an Aman resort? The 4 days we spent at Qunci Villas reminded us very much of some of the best boutique hotels we have stayed before in Bali.The setting is beautiful: amazingly wide deck surrounding the elegant long pool overlooking the sea (an absolute delight at sunset but very enjoyable too at any time of the day!),very well maintained garden and very comfortable well designed rooms. And we must not forget the extremely friendly and attentive staff: always helpful and their constant genuine effort to please is very touching and efficient!As for the food you will not be disappointed either: the restaurant, which first pleases your eyes as the setting and decoration are stunning, will then pleases your stomachs as well! A good variety of choices and all those we tried were excellent. We really did not expect to get such high quality in Lombok.Well done! We will be back for sure!"

Which was all very well because my daily cycling trips were challenging (although the guide did say I could slow down) and really interesting. You get a real feel for the island of Lombok by bike, and there's nothing nicer than a shower after under blue skies. Then you can step up relaxation with a tropical spa treatment at Qunci, good food, nice drinks, cool music, a sunset over Bali. Its a great break from the trials of city life.

All these rooms have wonderful front verandahs where you can relax on the comfy day beds. We enjoyed the generous breakfast served by very the obliging and super friendly staff as well as the wonderful cocktails at happy hour by the pool daily. The food menu was divine, we ate lunch by the pool and found it hard to choose from the vast selection of taste sensations which were all very reasonably priced.

","Excellent service but housekeeping could be better","My husband and I stayed in Qunci Villas for 8 nights in mid December 2009 for our honeymoon. Overall, we enjoyed our stay very much, and would come back despite the few shortfalls listed below.I was most impressed with customer service. Staff go out of their way to ensure your stay is enjoyable and comfortable. Staff like to mention the owner, Scott, occasionally in conversation. It reflects positively on the owner, and one of the reasons why I chose to stay at Qunci Villas was because the owner showed interest in how satisfied you were with Qunci Villa. He takes the time to reply to comments and interestingly enough - even adds you to Facebook.Areas for improvement:1. Bedsheets were not fresh and clean. There were blood stains left by the previous guest. I had to pull the bedcover open so housekeeping staff took the cue to change the sheet.2. They forgot to replace our towels. They took away our dirty towels and forgot to give us fresh towels. 3. Not so important but nonetheless- they fumigated the hotel during our stay and didn't give us prior warning. It would have been nice if they had told us earlier so we could make plans to be away from the hotel, and/or advised us to close our windows/doors and keep the bathroom door closed. We were a bit slow to close our doors/windows as we stayed in room 20, which overlooked the reception table, at the front of the hotel, where they started fumigating.4. Whilst the accommodation price was good value, the restaurant prices were rather pricey prior to the additional 21% tax and service charge.Additional info:1. We stayed 3 nights in room 7 (ground floor, ocean facing room, next to the restaurant), followed by 5 nights in room 20 (upstairs, garden facing).2. For our honeymoon, they prepared a complimentary Nasi Tumpeng, but they only advised us this after we stayed 3 nights. I thought that was a bit strange as it would have been more appropriate to advise us when we checked in on the first day."

","Bugs life or backpackers welcome.","Prologueâ¦â¦A/ The hotel that shows disloyalty and disrespect toward its guests welcoming and allowing backpackers to use its facilities for a drink in the restaurant must expect the appearance of the negative reviewsâ¦.. I was informed that this sort of practice is allowed PERSONALLY by the owner and the administration is not responsible for this inconvenience.Do you usually stay in backpacker places or the price of Sheraton? I don`t.B/ The hotel that endangers the health, comfort and life of its guests NOT proceeding with grounds fumigation at least once a week has to expect the appearance of the negative reviews. The hotel is full of all possible sort of insects that crawl, go, fly and land on your face, skin, sun chair, bed etc. I emphasis the fact that malaria and dengue (dengue especially) are not human friendly at all. I hardly imagine if people having come across the globe to stay in QV will be happy to catch some tropical fever only because the management is so reckless and savvy with simple precaution (the fumigation routine is executed in EVERY decent open space property across Indonesia, this is not a novelty, really!).To the review thenâ¦â¦1/ Room. Spacious, functional, lovely artistic details like orb lamp, paintings (different in each room), statuettes and very stylish day bed by the window. Nice terrace with sitting couch, chair and table. All good butâ¦â¦. You would not believe how exceptionally dirty the floor is (I`ve seen the floors in 5 rooms â all the same) â stains and dark filthy spots along the walls, around the corners, traces of all possible activity before me â everything displayed on the floor. Any housewife would shoot herself from hard caliber if someone suggested her floors are anything like that. I just wonder if this is the result of housekeepingâs lack of enthusiasm/ skills / training? May be QV cleaning team is not equipped with detergent, stain removers, bleachers (whatever) â come on! This is 21st century!â¦.. Or it is some constructional fault when due to budget limitations for the floor tiling was used the cheapest option disregarding climate challenges and weather conditions in the region. The result is still the same â either you always look to the ceiling or clean the floor yourself â guests are welcome to participate, as it seemsâ¦â¦ TVs are not welcome to the resort as a true disturbance to tranquility and natural peace. Safe deposit boxes, tea/ coffee making facilities either considered as excessive features. Though hair dryer, made-of-straw sleepers and mini fridge with drinks they provide. During my stay toilet amenities were NEVER replenished, a new piece of soap was provided once, two days in a raw the shampoo bottle remained empty. Wellâ¦.ohâ¦ah the housekeeping!The most unfortunate is room 40 that being on the ground has zero privacy and directly on the hotel passageway from reception to the beach. Everyone whom they allocate there complained and requested removal at first possibility. Rooms on the 2nd floor are definitely better and in higher demand, obviously. By the way 2nd floor rooms are better designed as well, as the terrace is actually a huge balcony and entrance to the room is in the back through a separate door. Rooms on the 1st floor use sliding terrace door as entrance as well.2/ Breakfast. I am amazed that none before me said a single true word about breakfast. The only remark about bkf I got from the previous reviews *bkf is OK* - that`s all! Actually it is NOT ok, it is simply and undeniably poor. The obvious thing that guests expect in the morning is a buffet spread. They do a-la-cart only instead. You are left with 4 choices â American (3 slices of fruit, glass of juice, egg any style, toast, tea/ coffee), Lombok (glass of juice, one (ONLY) pancake, cup of cornflakes, tea/ coffee), Lagoon (juice, croissant + toast, 3 slice of fruit, tea/ coffee) and Archipelago (juice, slice of fruit, nasi/ mie goring, tea/ coffee). The bkf is worthy of some Shack 58 on Gili Meno where room is smth like 10USD/ night, but not of decent respectful hotel that positions itself as boutique and elegant. If the administration and owner together are that savvy they should put at least all the food mentioned above on the buffet spread and allow guests do their own choices and combinations. By the way they charge additional 27k++ IDR for substitution of cappuccino or espresso for your coffee. 3/ Backpackers. As I said in the prologue QV allows on its grounds any walk-ins if they buy a drink in the restaurant/ bar. OK no problem if walk-ins just come to have a nice meal or drink, enjoying their time at the tables and not bothering guests. But when a bunch of untidy looking girls come from the beach and with dirty feet, greasy hair, cheap smokes, giggles yells and occupy half of sun chairs (front raw actually), jump into the pool and turn calm and tranquil place into a mess â that is NO GOOD AT ALL. This is disrespect, disloyalty and dishonesty toward paying guest, to people who came from across the globe to find themselves in the backpacker ambience??? I personally complained to the management, I saw an Aussie lady complaining as well, I saw all unhappy looks on faces of German guests, I saw shocked expression on the faces of Italian honeymoonersâ¦.etc and etc. Only the QV staff kept composure as the owner ALLOWS such practice. Thank you, Mr. Scott. In the afternoon when hotel paying guests usually gathered at the poolside to watch the sunset THERE WAS NO PLACE for them. Guests were standing on their feet while backpackers enjoyed themselves on the sun chairs. Staff said not a word. How do you like it?4/ Security. Zero to none. They have a single guard at the beach who easily abandons his position to run any sort of errand but his own direct duty. At the moment of backpackers invasion he was absent at all, none stopped them, none asked a word, none checked their bags (a direct security duty having in mind recent Marriott and Ritz- Carlton bombings in Jakarta , July 2009). And do not forget the fact that the hotel considers safe deposit box a nuisance at the resort. When backpackers are welcome, keep an eye your things, guys!5/ Staff. All friendly â come on this is Indonesia- but UTTERLY and unmistakably under trained. It seems every staff member is doing all possible things but his own assigned job. I saw a gardener that did towels at the pool (in the soil smeared robe, did he wash hands before?), I saw security guards running with 10USD note to change it at the reception when one of the guests fancies to buy a pineapple from a beach peddler. Twice they forget about evening baygone sparing in my room (mosquitoes said THANK YOU). Twice I ordered ice bucket, the staff came empty handed asking *what did I mean? Bucket or ice?* And this is not a language barrier as I speak bahasa.Restaurant service, especially in the morning, is slow and unprofessional. When tea or coffee is poured into your cup half an hour before the food arrives, what`s good in that tea?5/ Room service. Ha-ha-ha that is where the real fun begins. If a guest fancies to order meal to his room he has 3 options â run to restaurant and order the food from there, memorize the menu from the previous visit or call and ask restaurant staff to read the whole list aloud to you. All this simply because THERE is no room service menu in the room. Obviously this in-room-menu absence is ONE more general disturbance to peace and quite guaranteed in QV. 6/ Peace and tranquility. I witnessed a group of very noisy guests, as it appeared Russians, 10 people with 2 small kids (3 and 5 y.o) â that`s where the tranquility endsâ¦.. They yell, cry and shout to each other across the pool, across the resort, in their own pool, in the restaurant. I saw guest complain to the management and require the staff to take action, talk Russian gusts to some quite terms. Nothing was done, managers did not even try to approach them and ask for some respect to the people around. Poor helplessness and incapability from GM, shortsightedness from the administration in general! Paradise lost???7/ Dear fellow travelers who were patient enough to read my review this farâ¦ I personally thank you. A couple of things to addâ¦â¦â¦8/ Qunci villas hotel is even worse from the simple fact that it is older, more eaten by mildew, fungus and despite all possible repaints looks shabby and drab. When you step to QV hotel from Q pool V you see the difference in all corners â from untidy rooms, to dusty looking restaurant. I checked the floors in QV hotel â they are even worse. Do not stay there!9/ Food and Quali restaurant. Actually this IS a highlight of the property in general. Huge thanks and compliments to Pa Eddy from Bandung, the Executive Chef. Your cooking skills and creativity deserves a high praise. In my life I ate million different versions of Mie Goreng, your creation stands alone by far. Your kitchen is a true delight and savior of QV from total disgrace. Once I even saw a group of local exapts that came to have a sunset diner at Quali - truly deserved popularity. Two thumbs up for Pa Eddy.Quali restaurant itself looks astonishing and exceeds by far my expectations. It has undeniable charm and very stylish ambience. All eco friendly details from drift wood inspired benches to tables of natural stone are just great. Cooking team`s work compliments Quali as well. Restaurant is definitely and highly recommended. You can not find in Lombok a similarity or even a wage resemblance. 10/ Check out. Slow, oh how very slow! And I was the only guest checking out at the moment. In the end I asked to apply an official stamp to my billing statement. The guy tat the desk told me that they have ONLY ONE stamp and it is at the moment at QV hotel. In the end they send a driver to fetch the stamp and change for my 100k note that was amiss too. Oh, my godâ¦â¦â¦â¦.10/ Bugs. Weekly fumigation keeps insect population at bay. This simple rule is never observed in QV as a result of all possible color and size of ants, flies, bugs, roaches, grasshoppers, MOSQUITOES (denge and malaria) etc crawl, run, fly, land and even swim together with you in QV . On the last day of my stay some formidable 15 cm centipede marched proudly across my room and asked to convey its best regard to the owner. Windows have slits between the panes, sliding doors do not touch the walls properly, so every Lombok fauna is actually welcome to your room and during your sleep you are naturally exposed to any insectoid visitors. Enjoy it. Evening baygone spraying of your room is a lousy job and poor substitution of the fumigation. The centipede visitation was right after room spraying. As I mentioned before, twice the spaying was forgotten by the staff, mosquitoes said THANK YOU and sent a postcard to the houskeeping.11/ Never again. 12/ As always I thank everyone who read my review up to the very end, and do not hesitate to contact me if you have further questions.Schonefeld"

The welcome mat says it all - tired and worn out.. it could be a very nice place place but needs some work - stained worn out mattresses on the loungers - bedding and pillows that are not definately not appealing or comfortable... this place needs some work- on another note the staff were lovely very friendly and helpful the spa was great - very good treatments and pleasing spa rooms.

","Fantastic Hotel!","My husband and I spent 1 week at Qunci Villas in April after reading about it in the New York Times. I highly recommend this hotel. The rooms are simple, yet quite nice. The outdoor bathroom was great. Our room also had a cozy porch off the front. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. The restaurant was delicious and reasonably priced. The hotel arranged for a private boat charter to take us to the Gili Islands to go snorkeling for a day (I believe it cost about $65 USD for 2 people and snorkel gear). They also arranged for a driving tour of the island, which was fairly inexpensive. Qunci Villas will not disappoint."

","Sublime experience ....","With little or no expectation I was totally surprised by the quality of Qunci Villa's. From being picked up / dropped off at the airport my 5 days here were spent with several friends. Qunci is an ideal place to unwind and partake in adventures at your own leisure.For me I had a ground floor room which was well appointed in a minimalist style with an outside shower (which is so nice to have in this part of the world). The meals served from either restaurants were great, and did not have a bad experience. Staff were extremely friendly and very helpful at all times. Anything that was asked for, was carried out in a timely manner (i.e. had to change a flight to Den Pasar, Front Desk looked after this and it was done in a timely manner). I want to balance out this review with something negative and this is hard to find. Yes, there was no fitness centre - a clear negative. Yes, but really NO. No fitness centre whilst a negative, was compensated with adventures from climbing under waterfall to mtn. biking which we did for two days to explore the local villages. In all there was something for the active minded type A's to do, even know this was meant to be relaxing. Although be careful on the roads in Indonesia. That white line down the middle is I'm sure for decoration purposes only!! Also did the ""Hash run"" which is a local cross country run organised in the Senggiggi area on a late Monday afternoon (recommended).However I did organise a motorbike for a couple of days which is always a great way to see this part of the world. This I'd also recommend* (but only if competent with riding two wheels in this part of the world).The only question I now have to make is ""when do I go back to Qunci Villa's""?Enjoy ...."

The beach was nice if you go in to the water early in the morning (7:30-8:00) you can see quit big fishes swimming around. Some evenings had we dinner at the hotel and I must say it was really nice. It was also possible to sit on the beach and have your dinner but then you need to book in advance. In other words it was paradise"

","Fantastic honeymoon","A fantastic honeymoon location for my new wife and I, organised by my brother who lives in Indo and had the benefit of local knowledge. We stayed at the Qusia Villa high up on the hill, separate from the other Qunci Villa establishments, with stunning views over the top of palm trees to the ocean with magificent sunsets and views of Bali in the distance. The Villa has several separate (different buildings) bedrooms, so it can cater for a group although we had the place to ourselves. There is no shortage of space, with a gym and separate tv/living room as well as the outdoor (undercover) dining and living areas. The personal butler service is there for all your needs; in our case keeping us supplied with food and cocktails as we lounged by the long infinity pool. The butler also organised dinner out for us at a seafood restaurant on the beach one night (giving us the recommendation, checking the menu, making the reservation, and organising transport) although the food offered through room service was good (those banana pancakes for breakfast were delicious) and we had the pleasure of a candle-light dinner on the beach at sunset which was provided as part of the accomodation package. Basically there were too many great things to mention, to fit into a review. We will definitely be back, with others, and recommend you try it too."

","We never wanted to leave...","We stayed at Qunci Pool Villas (the hotel is in two parts, one is Qunci Villas and it's similar but a little older), and it was one of the best hotels I've stayed at.The staff were all fantastic, the hotel beautifully designed, our room had just about everything we needed in it (no kettle, though), the balcony had the most spectacular view, the restaurant served fabulous fresh breakfasts wonderfully presented, and everything was just so lovely. We went on a three-day trip to the Gilis (Air and Trawangan), and while the beaches there were amazing, I got homesick for the comforts of Qunci Pool Villas...the ice cold fruit juice cocktail we were served on our return (along with an upgraded room!) tasted sooo good.I never tend to go back to a holiday destination again, wanting to see new things all the time, but I want to go back to Qunci as soon as I can."

","Unbelievable value - 3 days felt like 3 weeks","My sister and I have just returned from 3 nights at Qunci Villas. Wow, we were so impressed with everything. All the staff were unbelievably courteous and helpful, everyone seemed to know our name within a few hours of us checking in. My sister fell ill and they were so helpful, attending to re-scheduling our flights, picking tickets up from the travel agent in town, arranging for a doctor to visit and generally checking in to ask if there was anything more they could do. Qunci Villas was lovely but Pool Villas is definitely where I'll book next time, newer and more spacious with beds facing the ocean. Massages and manis/pedis on the day beds out the front were sublime from there. And the restaurant food was really reasonable and delicious too. Have been raving about this place to everyone - really cannot wait to go back. Hint for those at Qunci Villas - the best ocean-view rooms are 8 and 10, if you don't get one of these, you won't be seeing a lot of ocean. Definitely take a trip to the Gili Islands too - so beautiful!"

The rooms were relaxed island style, but very clean and well kept. The small pool at our villa was quite nice, and the main pool is lovely. But, what really made this place special was the outstanding service. Within a day, the staff knew our children (ages 10, 9, and 5) by name. Throughout the resort, the people were friendly, helpful and professional. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the food is quite nice and reasonably priced considering the remote location. The resort runs another restaurant in Sengiggi which was also very nice, and even better value."

","Nice Hotel but let down at check out","We enjoyed our stay in general but beware if you need a late checkout. We had requested for a later checkout instead of at noon as we had an evening flight. Our request was refused. We were told we can have a room for shower before our flight and was eventually given a dirty room vacated by a previous guest. We were not given an option to at least pay for half day or extension of stay. We ended spending hours stuck at the hotel restaurant. We also suffered from diarrhoea and upset stomach when we got back home after our 3hr flight. We wrote to the hotel and never got a response. CHIN Hwee Siang"

","What a great hotel - can't wait to go back there.","We have just returned from 3 nights at the Qunci Pool Villas and absolutely loved it. We had room 22 at first, great room with amazing art work, lovely outdoor bathroom and ocean view. However, as it is on the ground floor next to the pool, it seemed a little less private and we moved to room 28, which is on the first floor and was also a lovely room with a nice balcony. The hotel is very stylish, the staff very friendly and helpful and the resort has a very relaxing feel to it. The happy hour offers 2 for 1 cocktails, which is a great deal. We had dinner on the beach one evening, a really great experience. Prices in the restaurants were higher than in Sengiggi, however not as expensive as in the hotel restaurants in Bali, where we went previously. The quality of food is really good. We took a taxi to Sengiggi on two nights, there a few nice restaurants. 'Square' is a fancier alternative, great food and nice atmosphere.  I had a coffee and chocolate body scrub and a facial in the hotel spa - 2 hours for $50. This is quite expensive for Lombok, but it was worth it! We would recommend this hotel and hope to return there at some point."

","Treated well","I stayed here for 8 nights and I don't think I could have chosen a better place. I stayed 5 nights at the Qunci Hotel and Villa and then 3 nights at the Qunci Pool Villa. Whichever location you stay at you have access to both restaurants and pool areas and the service is wonderful at either location. I did find the room at Qunci Pool Villa to be more updated, as well as an ocean view room worth the extra $$.Yes, there are ants in the bathroom, and the occasional gecko, but what do you expect when you have a shower that is outdoors? I had no issues with this.I really can't say enough about the service and staff. The staff is always very pleasant and genuinely helpful. The hawkers on the beach can get a bit annoying at times, but nothing that would prevent me from coming here again.The food at both restaurants was very reasonable priced and very good. Going to the town center was a 30-40 minute walk or 12-13K rupee cab ride.I took a day trip to the Gilli Islands through hotel. It was actually the outfit just next to Qunci Villa Hotel, so you could book directly with me. The boat captain I had was the best. He took us snorkeling and led us to see an abundance of fish and sea turtles. We even fed fish with bread which provided a great up close experience!"

","Hip hotel heaven","We stayed here for 4 nights in September at the end of a tour around Bali & Lombok, and it met all of our expectations. We were staying in the oldest part of the hotel complex, Qunci Villas, as we couldn't get in to the Qunci Pool Villas, but it was still great, especially for $75 per night. You can wander 3 mins down the beach and use the facilities at the Pool Villas any time you like.We had a garden view on the ground floor, very near reception (Villa 2), which was a bit disappointing, but it was still a great room, spacious, huge bed, lovely outdoor bathroom, and a big outdoor area with daybed and chairs. Villa 8 is definitely the best, we saw this on our last day, it is right by the sea and has an upstairs balcony looking out over the beach.The restaurant/bar was great, we loved the food and the cocktails at happy hour too (great Mojitos); the pool and restaurant face west so you get great sunsets. And the complimentary breakfast was excellent, 5 different menu options, including the ubiquitous banana pancakes!I would definitely go back to Qunci, it is a great place to chill, swim & snorkel and good for diving too. It was pretty quiet when we were there, and there isnt a huge amount going on Senggigi (down the road) so it isn't the place to go if you are looking for wild nights out (try Gili Air instead for that!)"

","One Word - Paradise!","This was our second trip to Qunci Villas, the 1st was 5 years ago. It was so good that we have returned again. The 2nd trip was even better than our 1st as they have improved.They have expanded to a new property not far from the original Qunci Villas and the new development is called Qunci Pool Villas. The concept is essentially the same as the original and almost identical, except that it is new and improved and bigger.Service and staff are excellent, and you can't really fault them. The weather at this time of the year is excellent - it is sunny, windy and cool. The villa grounds and rooms are very well kept, and one can easily unwind and relax here for a week as it is so peaceful.I highly recommend the Ocean View Villas as they have an excellent view from the balcony and a perfect place to chill and relax with the breeze blowing.My partner highly recommends and raves about the massages at the spa, even claiming it is the best he has ever had.We will return for sure, and so should everyone. Unless you're looking for nightlife and lots of activities this is the perfect place for a relaxing vacation."

","We will be back too!","Firstly, one small clarification: Qunci Villas are spread over 3 different locations (very close of each other but not linked together) and as far as we could see they seem to differ a bit with their standard. The older one is called Qunci Hotel Villas. The newer Qunci Pool Villas. There is also one separate huge and luxurious bungalow down the beach in some distance from the Pool and Hotel Villas. We stayed for 5d4n in the Pool Villas complex that looked much better (at least from outside) compared to the Hotel Villas. The place.Very well maintained, practically brand new, clean, stylish â very very nice. I would dare to say the nicest resorts we stayed so far. The only âbadâ thing â it is a slightly crowded space but not to the level it can become an annoyance. The number of bungalows is quite limited so you feel like almost in a kind of private club-like setting. We had a ground floor room directly facing the ocean and this was definitely worth some extra money - the resort faces Bali from the ocean side and with clear weather the Bali mountains/volcano are nicely visible especially during sun set. The beach is pretty narrow but water is surprisingly clean right at the doorsteps of the resorts. For US65 per 8-9h you can hire a boat (arranged with the resort) and go to Gili Islands for snorkeling. It takes approximately 1h to get there. They also have some different tours but we did not try them. The place is pretty isolated and the nearest bigger city is not really in the walking distance so either you have to call a cab and travel a bit or completely rely on the resorts two restaurants.The staff.Very friendly, always ready to help, often proactive but sometimes confused, likely because some of them do not speak English well. Anyway, one of the best service we received.The food.In average good to very good. Price level ok. One restaurant is in the Pool Villas, the other in the Hotel Villas. Both serve good food.All together.A perfect place to spoil yourself doing completely nothing. Very good service, accommodation, setting and value for money."

","We'll be back!!!","We loved this place! The rooms are nice, with cool open-air bathrooms. The food was just perfect, good value for the money. First we got a room on the ground floor, with no sea view, which was a bit disappointing. Also, our aircon wasn't working properly, so we had to spend 1 night in another hotel (which was compensated by Qunci) because ours was booked out, and then they moved us to the room with real ocean-view! But even this inconvenience didn't change my attitude. The grounds are well-maintained, very green and beautiful. I recommend to take laptop with a variety of good films with you because there's no TV there. In the evening and when it's raining it's good to have some entertainment. We enjoyed the SPA there - also very reasonable prices. Overall I think this place is a VERY good value for the money."

","Amazing scenery compromised by loud beach sellers touting","The good-there is no doubt that the view from the infinity pool overlooking the ocean deserves all the praise it gets. It is amazingly beautiful and divine. The breakfasts are good and the rooms (we stayed in a pool villa for our honeymoon) are nice. The staff were good (though sometimes forgetful) and gave us a special dinner for our honeymoon and also light the room up with candles.The not so goodHowever, as stated in other reviews (read 'the good and the bad') the beach sellers were like vultures constantly yelling and trying to get the attention of the guests at the pool. This was particularly bad during sunset when guests gather for happy hour and the stunning view. I also got a massage by the beach (on the Qunci Property) and was repeatedly touted during the massage! Even when I said no firmly, they lingered stared and insisted. It ruined it for me. They have security who stood and did nothing. I spoke to reception about this who acknowledged it was a problem and stated they had meetings about this. However, other hotels like the novotel in Lombok are able to manage this effectively by respecting both the local economy and the guests. The Novotel has a section for beach vendors and don't allow vendors to scream at you from the edge of the pool. The call for prayer at 5am was also annoying so bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. The bugs were also there, but I think this is more part of the island than anything else, staff sprayed the room at night. The internet is also very slow and expensive. Go to Senggigi instead.Overall, this place was stunningly beautiful, had yummy food and is worth a visit but I'm not sure I would stay there again unless the hotel changed their policy with the local vendors. Shame because it is stunning.PS The luxury villas looked awesome though and being above the hotel in the hills above, would have total tranquility."

","Pure Heaven On Earth","Stayed at the Qunci Pool Villa for 2 nights near end of May, it was an excellent experience. The place is beautiful, the service IMPECCABLE! I don't know why people complained about the size of the place. Yea it's kinda small, but it's a boutique hotel. Hello?!The room was clean, spacious and we could see both the mountain behind the hotel and the ocean from our balcony on the 2nd floor. Magnificent view that was.The staff were a fantastic bunch. Everyone from the front desk to the restaurant servers and houskeeping tried their best to make us feel pampered and well taken care of.We went for the 2 hours spa treatment at the Qamboja Spa in the hotel and it was a great 2 hours spent. The lady was skillful and very observant. All I can say is that the hotel staff really take pride in their work and deliver the best they can all the time.The infinity pool was amazing with exceptionally comfortable deck chairs. Downside, the touting activities on the beach started to get on my nerves by the 3rd day, as all I wanted was a good tan while I admire the great view and enjoy the serenity of the place. Yet I was disturbed almost every few minutes by a ""Mdm, you want sarong? Bracelet?"". Having said that, those people were trying hard to make a living and are harmless. Just that it would have been much better if it was a private beach, exclusively accessible by hotel guests only.All and all, it was a great stay and I will definitely go back again. And please, explore Lombok yet try not turn it into the next Bali."

After the grueling hike we spent most of our time relaxing at the pool letting our legs recover. The staff at Qunci upon finding out it was our honeymoon surprised us with candles and flowers in our room and a special Indonesian Wedding dinner by candlelight on the beach. It was a beautiful, quiet, intimate escape. Just a 40 minute flight from Bali, you can immerse yourself in a totally different vibe surrounding yourself in the untouched, natural, beauty of the Island and the elegance of Qunci.

","My favorite hotel in the world","The Qunci Pool Villas is without a doubt, my favorite hotel in the world. In fact, whether I'm staying at a Ritz Carlton or a Marriott, I can't help but to compare all other hotels to this one. In the end, I have yet to experience anyplace that is as wonderful as this one.I spent the second half of my honeymoon here as I had been advised that Lombok is a lot like what Bali used to be (I stayed for the first part in Bali). When we arrived, we were taken to the older section of the hotel, but after some initial concerns, moved over to the newer Pool Villas. This made a huge difference. The new side is amazing. We stayed in a first floor villa with an outdoor shower and a view of the Indian Ocean that was only steps away from the pool. The resort itself is gorgeous and incredibly affordable for all the luxury that you experience there. We spent the majority of our time outside, either on our porch, at the pool or beach, or at one of the outdoor eating spaces. Between the sounds of the waves or the prayer calls from a nearby mosque, I found myself lulled into such a calming and relaxing state of mind from the moment I arrived. The food at the hotel was so tasty and fresh. Everything from the seafood to the desserts were first rate and the wait staff seemed to remember every detail of our orders so they knew what we would want without even having to ask.The staff was amazing and went out their way to make us comfortable. Whether it was making small talk about US politics (Indonesians are quite excited about Barack Obama) or just making sure that our drinks were never empty, the staff here was top notch. I can't say enough about this hotel. It was the trip of a lifetime and I would highly recommend it to anyone who visits southeast Asia. And with prices this good, you cannot beat it!"

","The Good and the Bad","I was there with my partner for six days and these were the things I'd like to sharePros- Amazing service. The staff are uber friendly and try to fulfill every single request.- Great view. Unparalleled views of the ocean.- Food! Food! Food! I personally loved most of the food on the menu. I would like to recommend the grilled snapper with prawn, and the steaks. As for drinks, we had their local beer (Bintang) most of the time, and their happy hours are from 4 to 7pm.Cons- Peddlers. They're like vultures looking to make direct eye contact with their prey and pounce on them with their handmade goods. Not something I'd like while relaxing by the beach.- Boredom. If like me, you are one who require activities to fill your time, you will find there is almost nothing to do there. There's an internet cafe at the room behind the reception, no shop to buy things like snacks or a magazine, no gym, no television in the room. I was bored out of my mind on the fourth day. Be prepared to relax by the pool and do nothing else.- Morning Prayers. Everyday, at approximately 4:30 to 5am, the religious would start chanting. I was all right with it at first, thinking it adds to the flavor of the trip, but it started to annoy me after a few days.Neutral- Rooms. I stayed in a garden villa. The entrance to our second floor accommodation was situated round the back of the building which was a set of narrow steps. A set of lights help to illuminate the them in the dark but they promptly blew up a few days into our trip. Thanks to their quick service, the staff managed to fix it within an hour. The room felt quite cosy and the bed was very big and comfortable. Be prepared to encounter bugs lurking around your room. One night I found that I shared my bed with my partner and a cockroach.A few little niggles here and there, but honestly, overall a very lovely place."

","So high expectations and yet they succeeded!","We spent four days at Quinci villas and loved it. The staff and the food were top notch. The hotel picked us up at the airport and drove us to the hotel in 30 minutes, then we checked in and got our private villa, Quayla, with our own pool. The villa was furnished very stylish with Indonesian art craft and paintings, but the bathroom was IT. Excellent decorated with the shower under the sky next to some great art. Lots of flowers, fresh towels, and everything was always nice and clean. We ate breakfast, lunch and dinner at the hotel everyday, except for a one day trip to the fantastic Gili Meno island, and loved the food, generally we donÂ´t eat at the same place when we travel to new destinations but this was IT. We still dream of the breakfast and the chicken Satay in the cool breeze from the ocean and the beautiful views. DonÂ´t miss to enjoy a drink while watching the most beautiful sunset. We must give our best regards to the excellent staff, always helpful and very service minded. We always say that we want to see new places, but this place we really want to revisit someday."

","What Bali wishes it still was","The service was a little slack but nothing to worry about.The floors in the room felt dirty but it was a combination of condensation from opening the doors after having the a/c on and the bug spray they put on the floors. They really need to work out a better way to get rid of the bugs. The bugs weren't a problem but the icky floor wasn't nice. Watch out if you have crawling babies!The food was nice, not cheap but not too pricey. The restaurant locations at both hotels (2 doors down the beach from each other) are beautiful and with a western aspect the sunsets are amazing.Room 8 and 9 are the best rooms and cost nothing extra. 9 is ground floor so a little less private but great access to and from the pool and beach. Imagine waking up in the morning, opening the sliding doors, walking about 50m to have a wake up dip in the Lombok Straits while watch the sun hit Gunung Agung over on Bali then walking back to your room for a shower and breakfast on the front verandah....I wish I could start every day this way!Also, do yourself a favour and go for a 2-3 hr package at the Spa in the Pool Villas property 2 doors down the beach. Its not as cheap as the beach massage but the beach massage is not worth the Rp70,000 (US$7). Splurge on a 2hr package for about US$50 and you will enjoy it so much more!Oh yeah, there is a small shop that rents motorbikes across the road from the hotel. Nice guys and about Rp50,000 per day (easy to knock them down if you take if for a few days)."

","A lovely surprise","We chose this hotel because of its value and ranking on Trip Advisor. I sent an email with some questions to the email address on their official website with my flight details but no reply UNTIL I switched on my blackberry in a taxi from the airport to the hotel and realised they replied to my email when I am on the plane saying a driver will be waiting for us at the airport! Not only that, out of my list of questions, they only answered on the airport transfer. I find that an annoying trait in anyone especially on the service side - choosing the question(s) they want to answer and not reading the whole email. When we got to the hotel, we didn't feel special at all. I felt like we were just another couple coming to their hotel for a romantic long weekend/honeymoon. We didn't even bring up the matter about the email and to my surprise, they didn't even bring it up! Either the driver never showed up at the airport or realised it was their mistake. We were hoping to get Villa 8 because we read it has the best view, wrote to them in the same email and no reply. However, we did get the 2nd best which is Villa 9. We were pleased with the villa though we wonder why is it so difficult for the hotel to invest in a safe for only 20 villas! I felt the floor barefooted. YUCKS! It felt like there was a film of 'stuff' coating the whole floor. We only realised it after that the housekeeping staff spray the floor with insect repellent because of the ants crawling all over the villa - not sure if they do this with other villas too. After we settled in, we decided to have dinner. I was ready to relax. Recovering from food poisoning from a previous trip, I struggled to find a light meal on the menu which was not oily, fried and raw. I settled on a local dish called Ayam Sereh. And to my absolute horror (again!), the chicken was undercooked, almost raw! I nearly fainted. The waiter was apologetic and brought out the same dish but this time cooked. I lost my appetite before it arrived though. The pool area is nice, small but cosy and the only dislike I have is that BABIES should be banned from the villa! Screaming babies (happy or not) shouldn't be allowed to be in the same area as people who try to relax by the pool. They should have a rule on this like Club Med and other hotels. This place should be a place to make babies not bring them. Arrgh!And NEVER ask for the outside massage ladies on the beach to give you a massage! They lie (we wanted 2 hours and they had the nerve to tell us it is over when it is only 1 and 1/2 hours!) and all they do is stroke your body. We realise that Lombok people has no sense of time with other incidents that are similar EXCEPT the hotel spa service. Food selection/quality is average (Singapore price so not cheaper), cutlery/plateware/glassware are sometimes still wet from the dishwasher and I have a feeling the head chef is local because if he was a Westerner/Expat, he/she would go out and check/chat with guests, no? The main reason we enjoyed our trip is the fact Lombok is NOT Bali. More genuine smiles and less aggressive people, more laid back atmosphere. and much more of a natural beauty than it is man-made. Plus, the hotel crowd is a lot more civilised than most."

","An Oasis of calm...","Qunci Villas is the only option worth considering when visiting Lombok. Their levels of service, with the sublime attention to detail, puts the larger chain hotels to shame. On arrival into Mangsit airport we took a cab to the hotel, emailing the hotel directly to arrange a pick-up may actually prove to be a slightly cheaper option but the cab was perfectly painless as there is a taxi counter directly outside the arrivals hall. Expect the cab to cost around 90,000 Rupiah (6GBP or abt 8 or 9 US$).First impressions of Qunci when we pulled up outside were as good as those we would leave with a week later. The hotel is beautifully designed by a dutch architect, and whilst they have maximised the number of rooms for the size of the plot it never felt like we were intruded upon by other guests.We stayed in a Ocean View Villa and it had the perfect view of the ocean and Bali's volcano as was described when booking. The sunsets are spectacular; wildly orange, red and purple, it's almost apocalyptic.The room itself was spacious and airy, the bathroom had a wonderful open-air shower and the terrace was an enjoyable extra on which we could wind away the hours. Don't expect cable tv - there isn't any - and frankly i think it would have taken away from the whole air of calm which the hotel conveys.The pool area is excellent, a beautiful 20m infinity pool surrounded by very comfortable loungers overlooks the deserted Mangsit Beach. The only souls who occupy the beach are a few very friendly hawkers who thankfully have a sense of humour about your constant rejections. They offer all kinds of local produce... pearls, sarongs, fruit and jewellery. The few ladies offering hr-long massages are an excellent alternative to the more expensive hotel spa. My lady enjoyed them thoroughly - expect to pay around 80000 Rupiah.Also on offer by the beach hawkers are tours of the islands many attractions. Once again these are safe alternatives to the hotels more expensive offerings. We chose to use a young guy called Eko to take us on a snorkeling tour of the wonderful Gili Islands. He was great - he snorkeled with us and helped my wife (a nervous novice) find her feet for the water. As a former fisherman he was extremely knowledgeable and skilled in finding various species. Swimming with turtles was an obvious highlight. We highly recommend him, he also took us on a tour of the islands artisan villages and the beaches of the south coast which are incredible. (If you wish to find him - he often wears a white t-shirt with orange writing saying Snorkeling, Diving etc and you may see him touting for business around breakfast time on the beach front) Expect to pay between 500000-600000 Rupiah for a private boat trip... or slightly less if you book for more than one day.The food at Qunci was excellent. It's slightly more expensive than some of the restaurants of Sengiggi but the quality was always there. If you do wish to go into Sengiggi for your evening meal then most of the restaurants there offer a pick-up service - the front-desk can arrange for you. We can recommend Asmara and Square.Overall the staff were polite, friendly and never failed to bring a smile to your face. Happy hour and free fruit by the pool in the afternoon also helped! It really is an exceptional destination.The owners of Qunci really must be applauded for its outstanding contribution to Lombok's growing tourist industry."

","A Gem","Having travelled extensively we are always worried about the hotel being a ""let down"" on arrival, but Qunci Villa exceeded expectations. Qunci Pool Villas are aparently larger and more modern, but we stayed in an ocean view at the older but smaller Qunci Villa Hotel. Admitted the pool is between the room and the sea, but it IS an ocean view. In a nutshell, great room, lovely rainshower outdoor bathroom, well maintained garden walkways, beautiful beach, clean sea, good restaurant, fantastic service. For price/quality ratio one of the best hotels I've stayed in. Short taxi ride to other restaurants, possibility of day trips to islands/volcanos etc, and the hawkers are friendly and can be put off if you explain nicely! We stayed on the beach loungers and weren't hassled after the first day after we promised to buy something small at the end of the holiday (small being 3 or 4 US dollars). Had a great time! We live in Thailand, thi was our first trip to an Indonesian resort....and we'll be back to Indonesia!!!"

","Brilliant Service","I have stayed in many of the world's ""best"" hotels including dozens of Four Seasons and Ritz-Carltons, but Qunci has the best service levels of any hotel I have ever stayed in. Staff were friendly yet highly attentive. Off-menu food orders were happily complied with. Meals could be served anywhere on the hotel premises - lounge, restaurant, beach, villa. The chef would come out to take special orders. They even prepared a list of Indonesian dishes in response to our request. All the staff we dealt with displayed high levels of poise and grace - which is impressive given the low-key Lombok location and relative young age of the hotel. Yes, the hotel does have its faults - property is a bit crowded, room privacy is lacking, and there are limited recreational facilities, but the quality of service makes one forget all of these. Hats off to the management!"

","Unbelievable honeymoon - cant wait to go back!!","When I first started looking to book our honeymoon, my thoughts were to stay in bali for the whole time. That would have been lovely, but a huge mistake. The qunci is beautiful. I understand what previous travellers have said about the rooms, as from the internet site, they look quite basic. As it was our honeymoon, we opted to stay in the villa Qunang - one of the private luxury villas. As I booked everything seperately, we got out total holiday of 15 nights (including 4 nights at 5* kupu kupu barong in bali) including all flights for only Â£1500 each. Personally, I thought that this was a bargain for such luxury. What can I say about the villa itself? Well, nothing was too much trouble. We had our own butler, which we found a bit strange at first, but you soon relax into it as they make it feel so normal. We had a butler called Oni, who was brilliant! He used to spend his nights fishing for his dinner with friends, having barbeques on the beach - what a life!We had 2 very spacious bedrooms, both with en-suite bathrooms and outside shower. All very modern, yet traditional. The villa had a thatched roof, which looked lovely and gave a really traditional feel to the inside. There was armani furniture throughout, bang and olufsen stereo and tv, and the private pool was lovely (about 9mtrs I think). There was an outside dining and living area, and you could also enclose the lving room with glass doors at night should you wish. The pictures on their website http://www.quncivillas.com are exactly how it really is. As we were on honeymoon, they made us a special meal of local specialities which was beautiful. Your breakfast is served in your villa, and the butler asks you nightly what time you would like it the next morning, and makes it for you in your kitchen. You have a menu to choose from. The fresh fruit and juiced are just gorgeous!I knwo that this sounds a bit sad, but when we were there, it was the champions league semi final, and, as a pure red through and through, I was desperate to see the liverpool game. With the time difference, it wasn't on until 3am. As luck would have it, our tv broke on the day of the game!! Oni, our butler sorted it out with the hotel manager for us to be able to watch it in the larger private villa - the qusia. He gave us a tour on the day and made us very welcome. (No-one locks the doors there by the way - there is no crime!). If there's a group of you going to lombok, I would recommend the qusia - my goodness - what an amazing place! It has a private gym (which they let me use a couple of times), a huge 50 inch plasma tv room, an outdoor comfortable bbq area, an enormous infinity pool overlooking the gardens, beautiful bedrooms, and an outside kitchen. I haven't seen anywhere as luxurious. It would be a bargain if 3/4 couples went aswell! Anyway, back to our own place. There's nothing bad that I can say about it. Everything was fantastic. And the nice thing was that Lombok isn't hugely commercialised. As such, there are few tourists and most things are still cheap.Oni would order taxi's for us to get to our favourite restaurant - 'the square' in the centre of town. I seriously wouldn't bother going anywhere else. We tried a couple of other places, and they weren't a patch on it. All of the fish is caught that day and served in the restaurant. We would have 3 courses, plus wine, for a total of about Â£20 per night. I ordered the steak one night, and honestly couldn't finish it - it was huge, and cooked to perfection. The fish is so fresh and beautiful - I highly recommend the red snapper, and tuna steak. The seabass is also beautiful. I tried so many new fish that I'd never heard of before, and they were all delicious. We took a trip that Oni organised for us that took us to a local village, to see the monkeys and generally tour the north of the island. This is unmissable - such a beautiful place. It only cost about Â£15-20 each aswell.Overall - the best holiday I have ever had. There was maybe only 1 down sides:To get back to manchester from lombok - the flight is horrendous. You have to get an internal flight to denpasar (on a very old plane, that scares you to death!), then from denpasar to kuala lumpur for another pick up, then to doha and then to manchester. For someone who's scared of flying, it was all a bit too much! We flew with Qatar aiways, who were fab - the trip from manchester to doha and back was fantastic. New plane, loads of leg room, beautiful food (I know, shocking!), and state of the art tv's. When you get to Doha - it all changes. The planes are really old that they use from then on - no individual tv (with the old ones not even working) and bad food. Not good, when this is the bulk of your flight (11 of the 18 hours).Even with the flight though, I'd go back in a heartbeat.Make sure you go to the square - it's gorgeous!"

","4 nights turned into 1 night","Was excited to stay at this hotel. Read great things about it. My situation was a disappointment. Arrived from Ubud to find my ocean view room was now in the back of the hotel facing the spa. They offered to change me to another room, which was worse. Surrounded by the pool guests and facing next to the restaurant. I ended up with the first room. They are a bit disorganized. Good- Spa. I liked my massage. Wanted to do more treatments, but left. Pool LocationBad- Not a boutique hotel. Boutique is minimal and modern. This place is just minimal. Indonesia has many a gorgeous hotel. The rooms here are below average in comparison. Yes, outdoor shower is cute... but also full of ants and what ever else can come in from the outside. Keep the door shut when u you are sleeping. Maybe 3-4 true ocean view rooms. Most face the pathway and you need to be a giraffe to see the ocean. Disorganized reception. Bait and switch when you arrive. Food just ok.  The hotel has other more expensive villas. This part of the hotel is a second thought. They seem more concerned with guests who pay more at private villas and not those at the hotel. Rooms are not impressive. No safe lock box in the room. If all is good and ""safe"" then why security guards? Until your things are stolen and you get a blank stare at the desk. No thank you."

","Superb beachside five star villa resort on a pristine island","We travelled as two families to Lombok for four nights, arriving by Gilli Cat from Padang Bai in Bali. The drive from the jetty to the villas is spectacular - cliffs, palm-fringed beaches, fishing villages on stilts, brightly coloured fishing boats and almost no tourist development. On arrival, the reception staff were expecting us and the process was quick and efficient. The resort is small - perhaps 75m by 150m - but it's a jewel. The grounds are exquisite and perfectly maintained.The villas are gorgeous - thatched roofs, and ultramodern interiors, with outdoor bathrooms. The beds were very comfortable, too. We had one bedroom pool villas, which have very nice small (say 7m by 3m) private swimming pools. These villas do not have beach views. If you want a beach view, take one of the villas (without private pools) that are close to the main swimming pool. The two storey villas have particularly good views. The villas do not have televisions, which for us is a plus, although not all of our children share this view! Really great value, too - about US$145 a night per villa.The setting is just wonderful. The infinity pool stretches about 30m wide along the beachfront - it's beautifully finished in rough cut stone and smooth limestone, and the view from it is due west across the beach toward the spectacular sunsets behind the volcano on Bali, 30km away. The daybeds and loungers beside the pool are very, very comfortable, as is the massage pavilion that looks out over the beach - where a 45 minute massage will set you back only Rp 100,000 (~US$10) including a generous tip. The beach is very pleasant, but we did not spend time on it as it is public, there are no loungers on it and as with most public beaches, there are many vendors of the usual cheap jewellery. The vendors are pretty tame by the standards of most places and will leave you alone if you make it clear you are not interested in their wares. (We put them off until the last day and then bought something small from each of them, which made them very happy.) We did hire surf boards on the beach - about US$25 for a whole day, and you can have some basic instruction included - and immensely enjoyed trying to surf, with limited success. It is also possible to hire snorkelling gear, and arrange boat transportation to the Gillis or anywhere else, from the beach.We ate at the restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner every day but one, and we did not get bored. The food is good if not spectacular, and there are plenty of Asian and Western options. Mee goreng and nasi goreng for breakfast, and crispy wontons with almost very meal, were highlights. The wine list is modest but has some decent reds, whites and sparklers on it - unfortunately no-one seems to have discovered rose yet. The hotel proper - 100m along the beach from the new villas - also has a restaurant, but somehow we never managed the trek after happy hour, which runs from 1600 to 1900 every day. The mojitos and Long Island iced teas are great.Our one excursion was to see a temple at Lingsar and the foothills village of Tetebatu, where we ate a very pleasant meal at the Green Orry Inn. We hired cars through the hotel for a modest Rp 300,000 per car for the day. The driving is pretty standard third world stuff - swarms of motorcycles, fluid lane discipline, no signs - but we found our destinations. A day trip like this to see rice paddies and village life is well worth it. When we go back, we will try to see the southwest of the island, and trek the volcano.The service was genuinely excellent. The staff are very friendly, generally fluent in English or willing to try , and everyone was very helpful. Staff members learned our names, attended to us promptly and courteously whether we were by the pool or in the restaurant, and are quick-witted and resourceful. By way of example, when I lost my wedding ring while attempting to surf, the hotel straight away brought a diver to the beach to look for it. The diver's friend found the ring five minutes later - 50m out from the beach - earning a small fortune (in local terms) as a reward.The only thing I would change, if I could, would be the time at which the muezzins' call to morning prayer comes - around 5:00 a.m. If you are a light sleeper, you are likely wake to this. But you can always go back to sleep beside the pool ..."

","Great for Honeymooners","I came here for my honeymoon and requested for the Honeymoon package.The price I got was quite a steal for the Single bedroom villa w/ pool and that package also had a free city tour, a romantic candlelight dinner and spa treatment thrown in.Rooms are clean and well-maintained. After all this resort just opened as of late last year. The set-up for honeymoon was pretty nicely done. The grounds are pretty cramped and our private pool is not as 'private' as expected (at least to the next door neighbor). The food is pretty delicious though with a pretty hefty price tag. The candlelight dinner was such a pleasant experience. They set-up a table by the beach, adorned with strips of young coconut leaves that's folded into various patterns that are assimilated with wedding culture in Indonesia. The 4-course meal also include the Lobster Thermidor, which has got to be the priciest item on their menu. And it was delicious, of course.The spa treatment was the Balinese massage complete with a warm flower bath for the honeymoon couple. Delightful, I'd say.And the service there was superb. Maybe because it was the low season so we got all the attention we need but we're happy with that. Even their security guard never lack smiles for ALL their guests. Will I come back here again.. Perhaps. And definitely around the same period. Love it!"

Only a short ride from the airport we were very surprised when we arrived at the hotel. Having passed the others on Sengigi on the drive we very more that pleasantly surprised.

","love it too much...if only it was our home!","Stayed there for 2 short nites. Booked through qunci's website and reservations was very easy to make. We stayed in the ocean view room and the rate included return airport trips and breakfast. Airport is barely 30mins. Being very well season travellors and having stayed at many luxury resorts and villas, we really thought that Qunci offers real vlaue for money. It was tastefully built and decorated, with fantastic views of the ocean, totally beachfront, and impecable service from the staffs. Food at Qunci Villas was fantastic. The sand on the beach is sparkling black and fine and clean. And if you are lucky, you cld see turtles in the shallow water fronting Qunci at night. With happy hours at the hotel, you must not miss the sunset! In the morning, you will be amazed and mersmerised by the sight of sailboats which are the many fisherman boats...what a sight! The locals tout their sarongs, pearls, trinkets along the beach. They are really friendly and if anything, only trying to make a small living as they are poor. You cld get a beach massage for US$7/hr and conveniently get a boatman (for a reasonably fee) to bring you snorkelling or fishing or to the gili islands (more beautiful beach and water, though Gili Trawangan is dirty and noisy now, try Gili Menon and Air instead if you prefer tranquility) directly...no hassle. Happy staying...! Food in town is okay and the price is less than the hotel of course. And I would not worry about the raining season, its tropical rain, usually not lasting more than 1 hr."

","Paradise","My wife and I stayed in the Puri Mas on honeymoon, August 2008. I had booked two nights there by e-mail. Just after arriving, we took a stroll 50 meters up the beach and found the Quinci Villas. As soon as we walked off the beach, we were in awe of the quality of the complex. We dedided to have a drink, that led to having dinner, which was beautiful and very reasonable. We assumed that rooms at the complex would be outragously expensive, only to find out they were cheaper than the Puri Mas (this was a special offer as they were only just after opening...not sure of the price now). The Villas are about 1KM outside Senggigi, which is a good thing, unless you like tacky bars and hassle. They're on a beautiful beach, surrounded by dense green hills. The staff, as in the Puri Mas, couldn't have been nicer, the food was outstanding and the rooms looked amazing. If you like a more traditional feel, book the Puri Mas. If you'd like a luxurious paradise book the Quincy Villas. I wish I had. Actually, I wish I was there now"

","I love this place to bits.","Im a sucker for small cozy low density boutique hotels. This hotel is a gem in lombok. I rate them 10/10 in terms of everything. Service, food, room, ambience, spa, bar, infinity pool, beach. Its a perfect place to unwind and have a romantic getaway with your loved ones. The staffs are extremely friendly and helpful. Just one complain, but its not even about the hotel, i cant stand the local bracelet sellers and massage ladies who are like predators. Its annoying especially when they approach you when you're sunbathing or admiring the sea, staring far away into the ocean and find them staring into your face or making eye contact/shouting from far when they cant get near you. And these guys are very persistent. I dont blame the hotel for this, its just how things are over there. Just ignore them. One tip, try to avoid hanging out at the sun chairs and tables nearest to the beach although these are the best spot to have breakfast/dinner. Oh and also try to get a room at their newer poolvillas. The compound is nicer. Im definitely staying here again next year."

","The Perfect Getaway","I wanted to get away from all the stress of the year end, so i impulsively booked a flight to Lombok on SilkAir and high-tailed it to Qunci Villas. Through a bit of online research, I read that this resort was highly recommened by a New York Times journalist, so I thought why not? The best thing about this place is that it is intimate - only 20 villas on the grounds. There is another property Qunci Pool Villas about 100m away, but even with the two properties combined, I felt like I practically had the whole place to myself. Another great thing about Qunci Villas is the price. I was there just before the December peak season, so the friendly staff told me I could have my garden view room for US$75 nett per night, it came with free breakfasts and airport transfers. Incredible! Staff here are absolutely amazing. They knew I was a lone guest but they did not bug me constantly - a few of them were friendly enough to strike up conversation, but they also possessed a kind of intuition where they knew exactly when to leave me alone. I was lucky to have been assigned room 15, where I was subject to a gorgeous outdoor rainshower. I don't believe all rooms are equipped with outdoor showers, especially those on the second level. The usual mod cons were there, except the biggest mod con of them all, the TV. But that was a good move, TV junkies like me should be put on a fast once in a while so that we'd be subject to more naturalistic elements - like critters of the night and very vocal birds. Anyway, kudos to the staff for being such perfect hosts. When I informed front desk about my late flight, they didn't hesitate to offer me another room to store my bags and to take a shower before I depart. (It turns out, room 15 is a favourite!) And when I wanted to enquire about a snorkelling trip, they even offered to make the call for me. Service aside, the environment is heaven on earth. On clear days, the pool deck looks out to Bali's highest peak Mt. Agung. But the inspiring scene of unadulterated blue waters topped with souffle-like clouds is good enough to induce anyone to linger on the chaise for hours on hand. The grounds are also designed in a way such that an abundant of luxuriant plants are found in every corner. Sometimes it's hard deciding whether to cosy-up in the Balinese-style rooms or head outdoors to soak in the pristine elements."

","Worth flying all the way from Canada (that's very far)","This hotel is pretty great. One thing you must know is that there are 2 Quinci Villas. There is the new ""Pool Villas Hotel"" that has rooms and pool suites. Apparently the new hotel is nicer than the older hotel about 50 meters down the beach. Makes sense, newer=nicer. But we didn't acually see the older rooms as we stayed in the ""pool villas hotel""The rooms are pretty basic. There's no TV and the mini-bar is a hefty mark-up from any shop on the strip in Sengiggi. That being said, I loved the bathroom and private deck. If you want privacy on your deck you must book an upper room. Our room was said to be an ""Ocean View"" room. We could see the ocean, but there was certainy no view. So don't expect to be right on the ocean. Now the pool is where the action happens. They have an awesome pool. There are enough deckchairs for everyone. They are very comfortable and the staff will happily grab you a cold one to enjoy as you soak up the sun and enjoy a book. But if you want cocktails, wait until 4-7pm for the happy-hour. 2 for 1 cocktails. There cocktail list is not so inventive, but who cares?Breakfast can be ordered and eaten in your room. We found this to be a hassle for the staff and just ate in the restaurant. Breakfast was really good. Those were the only meals we ate there. Lots of great restauarnts in Sengiggi. Don't go to the big European catering restaurants. You can get great Indonesian food for a fraction of what they charge. Just ask a cab driver where the locals eat. Can't remember any names although I know they are not in any guidebooks.The service was pretty great all-round. However, the Spa have no idea what they are doing. DO NOT get your nails done. My wife had hers butchered. We also did a great tour of the Island. It took a whole day and a lot of driving, but was worth it. The best part was the local market and the beaches around Kuta.Bon Voyage"

","FANTASTIC staff","we traveled to Lombok in 2005 for scuba diving and stayed @ the then brand new Qunang with our own private pool. In 2007 we again traveled to Indonesia for scuba diving and stayed @ not only the Qunci Villas Hotel, we were lucky enough on peasant's wages to be able to stay @ (& be treated like ROYALTY) at Qusia. The staff without fail was exceptional and embarassed us by being so accommodating. We have traveled to other countries and within the USA and have NEVER before or since been treated as wonderfully as we have been in Indonesia. The Indonesian people in general seem to be a most happy population and are extremely interested in us as human beings., no matter if it was the dive boat crews or locals on the Gilis celebrating a 40th birthday. We have been invited and treated like family. We have stayed in Bali and on Flores and @ the 3 Gilis off Lombok. The Qunci staff has become like family and we are VERY excited about our upcoming 2009 scuba trip to again visit for a month.Suffice it to say..... the staff from cooks, to butlers, maids, security people, gardeners etc...... we salute them and there fastideous work ethic. Mr Coffey has done an exceptional job in choosing and training his staff. Wishing him all the best in his continuing efforts to improve (IF that's possible) his operations."

","A Fabulous Week","We had stayed in the first Qunci hotel 3 years ago and so when we decided to come back to Lombok we contacted them and they told us they just opened a new hotel: we had really enjoyed the first one but we were even more delighted by the new one.Rooms are spacious and nicely decorated and we loved the large open air bathrooms. Hard to say what we love the most actually about this hotel but I would say the pool and its immense deck: the pool is just above the beach and the ocean and is 30 m long! It is surrounded by a huge deck where you can always find a chair to relax: there is so much space that we were surprised when we were told the hotel was almost full as we felt we had so much room around us. It would be unfair to forget the restaurant: its setting and the decoration are amazing (even more at night with the great lighting) and the food can definitely compete with good restaurants of European capitals.The only thing we regret is that the garden is not that lush yet as it has just been finished but that gives us a good reason to come back next year when all that has been planted will have blossomed!"

","Very craped and no privacy...","We stayed end August 2008 1 night (although we originally had planned to stay 5 nights) at the new Qunci Pool Villas. Very disappointing!!! The rooms are nicely decorated but lack any privacy, especially the downstairs room. We were given a downstairs room although we had booked an upstairs room. As the hotel is so craped, everybody just has to look into each others bedroom. We ended up in closing the curtains all the time to catch some privacy. As it was not possible to move us upstairs the next day (although promised on arrival), we left. Lombok has still so much space (including an open plot directly next door) so it is very strange why they chose such a tiny sliver of land to build this new hotel. Qunci Pool Villas does not have a garden to sit in, just a small pool side where everybody hangs around, very crowed. The restaurant has excellent quality and views. But better just come here for a sun-downer or dinner and stay somewhere else!!"

","Small and friendly","For the money I thought this hotel was excellent value. The rooms were spacious and elegant. The gardens and pool were beautiful. I regularly stay in the usual suspects like the Four Seasons and this made a refreshing change. Obviously you do not get the same level of luxury and facilities but this is compensated for by there only being a small number of rooms, so the atmosphere is very chilled out and relaxed. It is also a fraction of the price. The food and cocktails are more expensive than elsewhere in Lombok but they were by far the best I have had on any of the Indonesian islands. Other reviewers have complained about the Mosque and the management's willingness to do anything about the noise from it. This seems somewhat unfair, as I doubt the local imam is going to be very flexible about prayer times. I was woken up a couple of times in the mornings but soon got used to it. I suspect that this is going to be a problem on all the Muslim islands. I did not find the hawkers a problem either, they were kept out of the hotel by security and when on the beach they would soon go away if you explained you weren't interested. This is not a five star hotel but does not pretend to be. I enjoyed my stay here more than any other hotel I have been to in Indonesia."

","Villa perfection","We have just spent a perfect week at Villa Qusia at Qunci Villas. The villa, service and staff were all excellent and nothing seemed too much trouble. During our stay we also saw the other 2 areas of the property (original hotel and the new pool villas wing), the new pool villas also looked lovely, I can see why some previous reviews say that the original building is crampped (but then again look at the price you are paying - you get what you pay for). This place is great for a relaxing break, Sengiggi is just down the road if you want it but if you are staying in a villa you have everything you need on hand thanks to a personal butler. On the whole ten out of ten, if we had to be picky then small things like the bed linen etc could have been better."

","A very cool Hotel","I loved this place. I looked into this hotel after searching the only guide I could find in NY..Lonely Planet (""Lombok's hippest hotel""). Glad I choose this place. They have 2 hotels located almost directly next to each other. The Intimate one (Qunci) is a bit small but fine if you like that small feel atmosphere. The new one (Qunci Pool) is much larger, more chic and where I stayed. Take your pick. What set this hotel out from others I stayed in was first the smiles and friendliness of the staff and second the price. At around $100/night, it is good value for me."

","Paradise","I found out about this hotel via this website (luckily before the previous review was posted!). I stayed for 4 nights with my boyfriend during a 2 week holiday to Bali and Lombok. The hotel was as beautiful and calming as I dreamed it could be. The staff were all wonderful, from the driver who unexpectedly collected us from the airport and gave us a running commentary of the journey, to the restaurant and bar staff who were friendly and attentive, to the masseure who was friendly and left my nails looking more lovely than I think they ever have before. The hotel actually arranged and booked our flights as I had problems with Merpati's website. Amazingly they recommended that we cancel a night of our stay with them and stay in Bali for a night as the transfer time between flights at Denpasar would have been v tight (they were right obviously!!)The hotel is about a 10 minute drive from Senggigi which has a number of hotels and restaurants but if you want happening night life this may not be the place for you! The hotel restaurant is gorgeous and the location is perfect. I think it will ibe mpossible for us to beat sitting enjoying a drink at the bar during sunset looking towards Bali, truely magical. The hotel itself is beautiful and well planned. The site is not huge but they have made the most of the space. We were lucky enough to stay in room 8 which had the most amazing views. The fact that there is no television, although initally daunting, means you have to relax and leave the world behind. You do not need anything more than the view out of the window anyway. We were not overlooked at all, each room has it's own entrance which gives you some privacy.The focus of the site is the beautiful pool just before the beach. The view from the path from reception is breathtaking.I wish I could return tomorrow."

","Cramped, bland and univiting","I cannot understand how other guests have raved about this hotel. The rooms are all cramped into a tiny sliver of land leading down to the beach just outside Sengiggi. Rooms with outside bathrooms have barbed wire running along the wall (to keep people out or us in?). The rooms themselves are bland and uninteresting although the air con was good. The mini bar was more expensive than far better hotels in neighbouring Bali and there was a total lack of privacy on the terraces or balconies. The pool area is the only space where you can catch the sun and there are 20 or so loungers crammed together so you are right on top of one another. The masseuse hassles you as soon as you arrive at the pool and the hotel even employs a guard to keep the hawkers from coming up off the beach. As soon as you step out onto the beach you will be hassled by hawkers. Not that we would begrudge anyone trying to make a living but this is not the nicest area of Lombok. Lots of cheap touristy restaurants and bars nearby.The restaurant itself is nice but again tables are all pushed up close together due to such limited space. The only saving grace of this hotel is its staff who were all charming. Not to be recomended at all."

","Beyond perfection","We stayed for three nights at the private Villa Qusia. The villa is located up in the hills above the main Qunci Villas hotel. Every aspect of the villa was perfection. The sprawling property includes three bedrooms (in three separate buildings), a media room, a beautiful open living room / dining room, a full kitchen and a well equipped gym. We were greeted by our private butler who took care of our every need. Most of our meals were prepared by a private chef provided by the hotel. The property is filled with the hotel owner's extensive collection of fine African and Asian art. The private 25 meter infinity edge pool extends out over the hill with a breath taking view of the ocean and the volcano on Bali. This place is stunning! We can't wait to return."

","Idyllic indeed","Lovely hotel. We stayed 4 nights. First 3 nights in room 15 which was on the ground floor with lovely open shower, but it had a slight plumbing problem and on the 3rd day there seemed to be a big increase in the fly community so we asked for a change. Room 16 was on the upper level (a bit more cumbersome if you have big suitcases or are not a fan of the stairs). Equally lovely but boring shower with limited ventilationThe hotel itself was lovely. Better not to eat there unless absolutely necessary because prices are rather high. However if you have to have lunch there, the chicken burger is absolutely delicious. Other food options are the resort next door where options are wider but service is incredibly slow. Go before you're famishing. But prices are good.Alternatively you can take a taxi ride to Sengiggi, the nearest town (no more than 10000 rupiah), where there are many restaurants and eateries at relatively good prices. We tried YESSY cafe (has free transport to and from your hotel), Bumbu, Taman. All good. For 2 persons, average price was about 110000-140000rupiah . For main course, drinks and a shared dessert. Further out in Mataram town (near airport) there is Irama Taliwang restaurant where you can get traditional indonesian food. For 4, we paid 145000 rupiah for a really big meal.Massages are 60,000 rupiah per person per hour (slightly less than SGD10) and can be done either in your room or in the pavillion next to the pool. The beach is rather short and though lovely (with a nice view of Bali on a clear day), we stayed away quite much because we were often attacked within 5 minutes by 'Sir, you want Rolek? 'Miss, you want necklace?'. Around the hotel there is absolutely nothing. So you either be adventerous and get out of the hotel or just stay and enjoy the pool (which is also very nice). Airport transfer is 94000 rupiah for a 2-way transfer for 2 persons.Tip: Book your tours in Sengiggi. The hotel's prices are crazy"

","Lovely boutique villa in Lombok!","Lovely Boutique Villa! Small complex but very intimate and cozy. No complicated corners, only go straight to pool/beach or room! We stay at room no 3 garden view and it makes no difference with the ocean view as the ocean is just 30 steps away. A cozy verandah awaits in front of the room after morning swim on the beach. No TV but the staff immediately provide one after we request. Lovely breakfast, it is not buffet but separately cooked from 4 choices. The coffee can be improved though. The pool is rather small but it is located just in front of the gray sand beach. Access to Lombok could be a problem, it took 4 hours by ferry then 1.5 hours by car to Qunci. Better use plane. One annoying thing is they place a Buddha statue in the room, even in the bathroom, which is not recommended in Feng Shui. We stroll along the beach, which also being shared with other hotels along it such as Sheraton and Holiday resort. Ah, outdoor shower is cute but a little spooky at nite and bugs wandering amongst your toiletries. After all, very recommended!"

","Surprised","I saw the reviews on the hotel and thought I would try it. I was a bit surprised. On the plus side the location is pretty and the staff very friendly and helpful. On the negative side there really is not much in the area around the hotel. Also the hotel is small. The lot is long and narrow so it is very compact and there is very little privacy. The pool was extremely small and the garden, although well done, was really just a wide path between the villas. I also thought the rooms were dark and need some renovation. I am not a fan of the big hotel chains but I moved to the Sheraton."

","Loved the unique stylish hotel! Great value for money","Great value for money, I had an excellent time here! Friendly helpful staff, spacious & nicely decorated room with super king size bed (I have to admit, I slept for more than 15hrs one night cuz it was so comfy!!!), every room comes with your own patio where you can sit & relax (I stayed in an ocean view room) It's somewhere I would definitely like to stay again.(The Muslim mosque does play their praying music 5times a day... but it didn't wake me up at all and didn't cause too much problem).Qunci villa is about 10mins from Senggigi beach (you'll not be able to walk from the villa to Senggigi) and there's not much around the villa. Taxi costs around $12000RP to Senggigi beach (one way). Senggigi beach has restaurants and some bars but if you would like to do some more adventurous activities, you definitely need transportation as Lombok is pretty big. The hotel can arrange the trips for you at a reasonable price (me & my boyfriend rented a car... but it's definitely not recommanded... it was quite a horrific experience). An alternative is you can rent a car with a driver, which might workout to be cheaper and you don't have to worry about getting lost or running over a chicken/ cow/ cyclist!"

","Very funky","Stayed for 3 nights and would definitely return. The outdoor bathrooms beg you to indulge in a shower under the sun and/or stars. Thankfully the clientele seemed to be mostly young Europeans without children in tow, allowing you to sit by the pool and sip your delectable cocktail whilst watching the golden sun set over the neighbouring islands. The township of Senggigi has been hit hard by a drop in tourist numbers, leaving many abandoned buildings and a large number of very persistent touts. Don't let this get you down. Enjoy the fantastic food, affordable boating trips, and exquisite hotels."

","New Joglo! ","Part of me wants to keep this a secret, but they've done such a great job with this it deserves to be known. If there is a nicer accommodation in the Gili's I don't know about it. Like the Hideaway, this 3 bedroom Joglo is tucked away in the middle of the island about a 12-minute walk to Scallywags Beach Club. For a family of 5 it is ideal. Fully stocked kitchen with beautiful, new stainless steel appliances and granite counter tops. Great lighting - plus a Bose home speaker with a built-in iPhone 5/6 jack. Perfect sized private pool. And the indoor/outdoor bathrooms and showers are as good as it gets in Indonesia. Plus yummy beds, bedding, linens and pillows. And the Joglo comes with its own cellular ""concierge"" phone which has about 5 preloaded numbers in it, any one of which will ring to various Scallywags staff who will then take care of whatever you are needing - from ""room service"" to more towels to arranging a water taxi. Perhaps a negative for some people is that there is a large mosque about 50 meters away, and the 5x daily call to prayer may be an issue, but it wasn't for us. All part of the cultural immersion. All in all, we love Gili Air and we love the new Scallywags Joglo. It was absolutely lovely - and a great value. We will be back!"

","Great place to stay ","We were supposed to stay one night, but extended to three. We switched rooms from the regular to ruma dua (because of the extension) - they took care of our luggage and it was a smooth transition. We actually liked the ruma dua a bit better because it had a bigger and relaxter terrace outside to chill. The beach is indeed a couple of minutes walking from the room, but we did not mind at all. We would take everything we needed in the morning, have some nutella pancakes and made to order eggs at breakfast and either relax on the reserved beds or explore the island from there.Absolutely great and friendly staff!"

Just a couple minutes walk from the harbour, this place is a brilliant hideaway. With gorgeous, modern rooms and your own private front garden. We were first a little sceptical about being away from the beach but it actually made no difference and we like that you could escape the beach/sun and lounge by the shaded pool at Scallywags. The staff are so attentive (even saving us from a few large creepy crawlies). Breakfast is served at the beach club (5-10 mins walk) and its the best breakfast we had in Bali.

Free water at the room, nice pool, great ""outdoor"" bathroom, great towels and most important of all - a great bed. We had some trouble with the water flow at the first room we were checked into, but that sure turned out not to be a problem. They immediately helped us move our stuff into another room. I can't point out enough how KIND and helpfull the staff were. Always asking what you are going to do, where, when ect. and always ask how it was when you get back home. It really felt like being home. If you have any questions at all, just ask the staff - if they don't know the answer, they will find out and then tell you.It was absolutely amazing and also really romantic for a couple like us. The hideaway is located a 10 minutes walk from the beach and their beach club (their restaurant where you eat breakfast) but that was in fact really nice. A little walk every morning is nice and because of the distance to the beach, it was always quiet at the hotel. Breakfast is great - try out their banana pancakes! Yum.

","Little private hideaway","Scallywags Smugglers at first made me skeptical since you have to walk a little ways into the island away from the beach but after staying there for 4 days I actually preferred it. You have your own little bungalow away from the hustle and bustle of the beach. The staff was amazing and the unit was excellent. With your own little veranda and patio area and good size for 2. The A/C which is necessary was excellent and the room very comfortable. The pool is a little small but then again you are on an island surrounded by beach. The breakfast is a ways away at Scallywags Restaurant and it was just ok. I am not much of a breakfast person so it didn't bother me but there are better food options on the island."

You are right next to Classico Pizza which has the best pizza I have ever eaten (and my husband is Italian) - we actually went back twice! It is run by a lovely Italian couple who have been on Gili Air for 2 years. The staff here were lovely and very helpful. If I were to come back to Gili Air though I would stay more towards the north side which is even more remote and quiet, although you have less choice of places to eat."

Turn down service nightly with water. Also offered in the room: blow dryer, flash light, converter, umbrella, mini bar, robes, etc. The a/c is excellent in the room & wifi is a bit slow (to be expected on an island).

Breakfast is located at the Scallywags beach bar (8 min walk, 4 min cycle): buffet style including hot bar, cereals, fresh orange juice, yogurt, Balinese or NescafÃ© coffee. Also on offer is cooked to order pancake & egg station. Staff are excellent & eager to help always. Can also have access to beach chairs right on the water free of charge.

The room also comes with a buffet breakfast at the restaurant (a 10 minute walk away) and free access to the beds on the beach - it all ran very smoothly and professionally, and made our stay very relaxing. Would come back again and recommend to others! The only (very minor) qualm I would have is the complimentary small water bottles provided every day - given the waste problem the islands seem to be dealing with, it would be more environmentally friendly to have a water machine in the room or lobby that we could refill bottles with, rather than producing more waste."

","Fantastic stay!!","We absolutely loved our stay at Smugglers Hideaway. The last time I visited Gili Air, we stayed in a bungalow on the beach, so I was a bit apprehensive about staying off the beach in the village. But I actually enjoyed it even more! We had half a dozen restaurants and mini marts within a few hundred metres - a great way to sample a range of local food. There are no restaurant facilities on site at Scallywags, but this was also not a problem for us. We really enjoyed the walk to the Scallywags beach club for the breakfast buffet (huge variety and both egg and pancake station) and the in-room mini bar was good value (although the free mineral water is limited to 1 bottle per person per day). I loved the pool because it was under shade cloth and therefore always cool - a boon when the Gilis can be so hot!The staff were all fantastic - friendly, efficient and professional, leaving the rooms spotlessly clean every day. Check in was a breeze. You also get a free sun lounge at the scallywags beach club which you can reserve all day, and put any drinks and food on your hotel bill - super convenient!! And the snorkelling gear we hired from the dive shop was great quality and value at 45,000rp per day! And... we got to swim with sea turtles - bliss. All in all, a pretty perfect stay!"

Highlights is the little courtyard entrance each room has, it also has a nice small and clean pool. Smugglers is a good escape when you want to take a break from the rest of the island! Nice and quiet too. It doesn't have an adjacent restaurant so no room service etc (would be handy when you're not feeling 100%) but we didn't mind - Scallywags restaurant is only a short walk and has the added bonus of snorkelling right in front. You can hire gear next door. Highly recommend Smugglers in terms of Gili Air standards!!"
