"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","Danadventurer","","Great place to snorkel and dive ","We just had a great week in family at Komodo resort. Perfectly located in Flores best spot for diving and snorkelling, with beautiful islands surrounding. Crew are competent and the boats are very comfortable with upper deck equipped with fat boy type seats.The resort chalets are simple yet comfortable with big room and bathroom. Equipped with performing air con, hot water, mini bar, and fast speed internet.Even better is the food, excellent compared to usual Indonesian standards. Indonesian tasty food for lunch with Italian style dinner. Good choice of cocktail and vines at very affordable prices. A great place to stay and to enjoy the amazing underwater."
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","Todd T","Calgary, Canada","Paradise above and below the water!","My wife and I stayed at Komodo in April 2014 and we can not say enough great things about the place. The initial conversations I had with the dive shop and resort staff was easy and made you feel confident you had made the right choice. As the boat pulls up to the dock and you take your first real look at your tiny little island getaway we knew we had made the right choice for our week holiday.The accommodations are perfect and how can you beat the view every morning. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom was excellent, and again the view from the patio doesn't get much better for relaxing after a wonderful dive or gazing at the stars at night. The food..... what more can you say about that except absolutely wonderful! I am not a dessert person but the chocolate mouse they made... wow! Everything just ran smoothly in the restaurant. Wake up, have breakfast before your dive, place your lunch and dinner menu and prepare to have your taste bud blown away by the quality of the food. Great job to everyone who makes/prepares the food. Saved the best for last.... the scuba diving! The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. I enjoyed the many conversations we had in between dives. They spoil you - not only with the dive sites but when you show up at the resort you put your gear in a box and let them know the day before if you will be diving. All you have to do is walk onto the boat and they have you covered. The boat is very comfortable and the lunches were good as well. When you arrive you are required to do a check dive (which is normal) on their house reef. The house reef was a pretty nice dive, after diving that I knew we were in for a treat when we started to go to the other dive locations. I would recommend doing the night dive on the house reef as well. Our favorite dives were Castle Rock and Batu Bolong they were right out of the pages of National Geographic! Truly an amazing place to be, you know when your dive guides are truly excited and pumped after a dive, you just experienced something very special. From the sharks to the schools of fusiliers, to the schools of fish (too many to mention) it was unbelievable. Even writing this it brings back a smile to my face. We have dived in many places around the world and your dive shop definitely ranks up to the top ones we have been fortunate enough to dive with.Day trip - we did the day trip out to Komodo Island and it was worth it. Seeing the Komodo dragon in the wild was a great experience, even though the majority of dragons you see (when we were there) are by the kitchen and the living quarters. The hikes are easy as you do not gain much in elevation, being avid hikers we thought the pace was fairly slow but I guess it isn't bad too slow down on holidays. On the way back we snorkeled at one spot with 3 large Manta Rays for probably 30 minutes. Amazing experience! We had the opportunity to dive at Manta point as well which was good, but the snorkeling experience was much better as their was fewer people.Thank you Komodo Resort for a great experience, we will be coming back one day!"
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","spcortina","Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","Great resort when you want to get away from it all","My husband and I stayed here the first week of January and even though the resort was closing down for the season two weeks later, they took fabulous care of us! We did a week of diving and were not disappointed with the corals and the critters we saw (even though the water was COLD!) The stand alone cabañas are lovely, nicely decorated with beautiful four poster beds and a comfy mattress. The bathroom was not air conditioned and since we were there during the hottest season, it got a little warm in there. But oh my, the food! Lunches are Indonesian fare - delicious and satisfying. We had traveled to Indonesia before and had left not thinking too much of local cuisine, but the lunches at Komodo have opened our eyes to the possibilities of Indonesian cuisine. And then there was dinner. By far this was some of the best Italian food I have eaten anywhere in years! This level of cuisine would be high in a big city, but the fact that you are in a small, deserted island in the middle of where the Indian and Pacific ocean meet - it's amazing! There are four course per dinner, a salad, pasta course, main course and dessert. And you should pace yourself, but don't skip dessert! The staff was incredibly warm and friendly. The dive staff was knowledgable and obviously enjoyed their jobs. All in all, it was a fantastic week!"
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","Drew G","","Easily the best placed I have ever stayed","Komodo Dive Resort is lucky enough to be in one of the most beautiful spots in the world - above ground and underwater. The diving is simply unreal. The snorkelling (which you can do right off the beach) is extraordinary. The three meals a day you receive are magnificent. The staff are friendly, helpful and always keen to chat.We stayed for 4 nights (wish it was longer), dived for three for $250 a day per person - which is very reasonably priced for what you get. Will definitely be going back in 2016/2017."
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","PamRamali","Melbourne, Australia","Flawlessly run paradise island","My husband's family and my family stayed at Komodo Resort for 4 nights through to NYE 2016, and had a fantastic time! It is not easy to find a resort that could please 12 very different people (my husband's family hails from Sweden while mine from Indonesia; 6 of us were divers while the rest snorkel; age range between 22 and 75), yet Komodo Resort was met with enthusiastic approvals from everyone in the group. Reservations were very smooth and problem free. Arrivals were so smooth - we were on the boat headed to Sebayur within 30 mins of getting off our plane. Then we got to meet Elena - really, the core of everything we love about Komodo. She puts guests above everything else, and not a detail is overlooked - from fruits when we arrived, to a homemade birthday cake for my dad's birthday, to boxed lunches for Komodo dragon trips. At one point my sister broke her flip flops (a necessity on the island!) and she even sorted out a new pair from Labuan Bajo on the same day - incredible! Both divers and snorkelers were very warmly accommodated. On the first day, they fit you out with all the gear you need, and if time allows, get you to do a check-out dive, which I appreciate. The dives were of course incredible (if you're a diver and you haven't been to Komodo Islands, go NOW), but the divemaster and boat staff went on great lengths to ensure that not only would all our needs be met, but also that all our the snorkelers of the group had a great time as well, by giving them specific briefings and providing speed boats. The one thing we did not (and still do not, to this day) understand is the fact that they ask you to put together your dive equipment. My husband and I have dived all over the world (Grand Cayman, Cuba, Aruba, Mexico, Palau, Sipadan, Bali, etc. - even Komodo the previous year as well), but this was literally the first full service/non-budget operator we've ever had that asked us to put together our dive equipment. It is not a big deal in and of itself as the remainder of the service was impeccable (e.g., they put the equipment on the boat for you and rinse them afterwards), but we are confounded as to why such a resort that otherwise provide 5-star service would not put together divers' equipment. When asked, their argument was safety, which was not a valid argument in our views, given all the other dive shops we've ever been with also put utmost focus on safety and could still put together equipment - this includes the dive shop in Labuan Bajo we went with the previous year. Further, our equipment was rented from the resort, so therefore Komodo logically would be best placed to put them together and take them apart - both from the equipment maintenance perspective as well as safety. All in all, not a huge deal, but we are so confounded by this, especially in contrast to the flawless service and operations that the resort otherwise provides, that we thought it is worth pointing out. Divemasters Luca and Sam were a joy to dive with, thank you! Given the resort's location, we would be back every day around lunch time after 2 incredible dives, so the days are as good as you could ever wish them to be. The rooms themselves were very comfortably appointed. I would not put them in the truly luxurious category, but they are definitely nice, clean, and lovely - they had aircons, a spacious bathroom, and even a pail of water to wash your feet/flip flop so your bungalows don't get too soiled by sand/soil. The bug nets they put around the bed every evening were very useful, as well. We did find walking back to the bungalows a bit of a challenge when it rained, as the soil became muddy; this is definitely something we feel strongly that the management can very easily remedy by installing gravel/walkways leading up to the bungalows. Also, there were a few bugs and gecko poo to be found in the bathrooms every now and then; not a major issue however and really nothing that can be done about it. Food was probably one of the topmost highlights of our stay. Indonesian food for lunch and Italian food for dinner provided for ample variety, and the quality of the food was top notch - we were quite the group of foodies, and we were very impressed. From Indonesian fried rice to spaghetti alla puttanesca, everything is very authentic and incredibly tasty. Bravo to the chefs and kitchen staff. One tip - definitely check out the house reef early. Even snorkeling, it is one of the most beautiful and lush reefs I've ever seen! We unfortunately checked it out too late on our last day, as we otherwise would have liked to do a shore dive given how pretty it was. All in all - bravo for such a flawlessly run paradise island - and thank you again to Elena who makes the island tick!"

My special thanks go to Leo, and the rest of the Dive crew for taking me to the fabulous dive sites.The bungalows were super comfortable and charming. The food was fabulous even for the vegan that I was. There was always somethings delicious to eat.The staff is extremely friendly, and the tours to Komodo Island were well organized. One of the islands facing the resort, actually looks like a sleeping dragon. I am still dreaming about some of the dive sites I dove at, and will certainly visit the island again."

Transfers were seamless and day trip to see Pink beach, Komodo dragons and snorkelling Manta point was incredible.Very relaxing and enjoyable stay- Thank you to all the staff."
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","scorpius77","jakarta","Very pleasant stay at the Komodo Resort","We stayed at the Komodo Resort last week. In the beginning we didn't expect to see much but Komodo turned out to be paradise for snorkeling and diving. Although I heard the waters in Raja Ampat are more transparent, we saw mantas swimming just 2-meter below us, some shark, and sea turtles. The corals in Batu Bolong are nice too although current can be a bit strong for those non-swimmers. The resort itself is professionally run, thanks to the Italian owner and manager, Elena, who took care of us really well. For a resort in the middle of nowhere, the Italian food is great especially the basil/pesto sauce pasta and thin crust pizza. As Indonesians, we would prefer more selection of grilled fish, crabs, and prawns/lobsters served in local Indonesian style but I was told there is some restriction on fishing around the island although we saw some delicious-looking fish swimming below the pier. Other than snorkeling and patting komodos, we enjoyed the tranquil night atmosphere while chatting with the other guests. Wish I could stay for a few nights longer since we did not get to explore some of the the other scenic spots like pink beach. Some people mentioned the rate is a bit high. Considering the high cost of transporting water, fuel to the island, quality of service and other stuff (70+ well-trained employees), I can understand. I hope they can keep up the good work and care to the sea environment lacking in Indonesia."
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","Priscilla V","Jakarta, Indonesia","Unforgettable holidays","We thought 3 nights to stay was enough, but we was wrong. The breathtaking scenery, professional staffs and their hospitality makes us hard to leave. Thank you for the owner and Helena who understand us about our 8 hours delay flight from Denpasar to Labuan Bajo, finally we made it in the evening but too bad we have to skip the Pink beach. We really enjoy playing with the shells in the seashore or snorkelling just in front of our balcony room. Helena makes everything comfortable during our stay, from visiting the komodo dragon in Rinca island, swimming with manta rays, snorkelling and trekking. The food was delicious, however the portion was a little bit too big for Indonesian people like us. The price in this resort was affordable, especially if you compare to depart from Labuan Bajo. Staying in this resort will save your time to reach the highlights destination. The most important thing is they make us feels so comfortable, as the staffs will assist you everywhere, as our diving instructor assist 2 seniors in our group to seeing mantas in the sea. The night view above the sky was amazing, the stars are bright and there is 4 milky ways during my first night. Make sure to bring flashlight with enough battery, mosquito repellent, sunblocks, very light clothes, simpati telephone sim card (others are not working) during your stay. We wish to come again ♡"
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","mcp1958pl","Krakow, Poland","3 weeks in paradise","No cars, no barking dogs, no karaoke bars, no crying children (mostly) :), diving 2 or 3 times /day in one of 10 top diving spots in the world, snorkeling on pristine coral reef couple of miles long which starts in front of your accommodation, spotlessly clean accommodation (take AC or you die), fantastic food and very very friendly waiting staff. Italian food is the best we have every tasted anywhere in the world including Trastevere area in Rome.Dive instructor Luka put so much effort in making us better divers (28 dives). We finally graduated from shrimps to sardines :). Leo and Sam diving instructor and dive master were very friendly, helpful and professional. The best diving one can imagine. Mantas galore, turtles, variety of fish, unspoilt coral. Fantastically well organized and executed resort and its activities. Ellena the resident manageress took care of every requirement with a smile.Hats off to Antonello (co-owner), management team and the team of workers at the resort. They created a paradise. To get back to 'reality' you just go to Labuan Bajo and see the difference. We will be back for another 3 weeks within a year or two.Excellent Wi-Fi in your room !!! - free of charge. No TV !!!!The best sleep we had for some years !!Thanks a million for the best chill out vacations we ever had. Mario"
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","KSJones1","Shanghai, China","Go only for the Diving (and snorkeling)","I was really excited to stay at this resort after reading all the fabulous reviews but, as the owners themselves say, it is only a 3*. Perhaps to those who regularly stay at dive resorts this feels a little more upscale but we like to stay in more upscale resorts and then also dive so the expectations were higher regarding the resort itself.The diving here is fantastic and the snorkelling is actually also really incredible - while snorkelling I saw a reef shark, mantas, incredible coral and probably the most diverse ecosystem I've ever seen. No arguing that this is an amazing place to dive and while we were there for 5 days there were people that were there for 2 weeks, doing 3-4 dives per day and not diving the same location twice. Fantastic experience.If you don't dive though, or actively go out in the boats daily to snorkel, there is really nothing else to do. The beach is not really a swimming beach, except to go out snorkelling in the house reef but not a beautiful beach to go in and out of the water and sit at all day (unless you are super immersed in a book and don't really care about your surroundings).The breakfasts are basic, the lunches are fine and the dinners are good and very plentiful but not spectacular. Loved the cheese table that was there one night but would have loved more choice in desserts - same choice of desserts for the entire stay for all lunches and dinners. As for the rooms, I have to say that we slept very well. Of course you're exhausted after being out in the water all day. I have no issues with no tv but would have loved better connection to wifi in the room like there was in the main areas. We brought an extra carafe of water to the room every night from dinner since the water there was not enough and no phone to call for more (and it is super dark at night to go get more). I think my biggest issues were with the linens. The sheets, although I'm sure clean, had little holes or stains on them which was a real ick factor and the white towels were kind of greyish blue and looked like they had been washed a million times with the purple beach towels. I think this linen factor is really what kept me from making this a 4* experience vs a 3* - this could easily be a very boutiquey kind of dive resorts if the attention to these kinds of things is kept. I do understand though that they have to send the laundry away so maybe don't have total control.Overall, this is probably a great alternative to a liveaboard but for those of us who like diving as an activity, rather then being the whole vacation, 3 days probably would have been good. Personally we wouldn't go back since there are lots of great places to visit and dive around the world but I am very glad we did dive and snorkel here - it was very memorable!"
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","oldexpatdiver","Seoul, South Korea","A great way to dive Komodo","A wonderful resort that provides [relatively] short / easy access to all the main Komodo dive sites. Bookings, airport transfers and similar ""logistics"" all managed smoothly and efficiently by email and / or telephone.Accommodation is very comfortable, in bungalows that are comfortable and have been thoughtfully positioned to ensure guests' privacy. The food is amazing, tasty and plentiful. Indonesian for lunch and Italian for dinner; if anything, there is probably too much of it. In general, the staff are friendly and willing, nothing is too much trouble.Diving from large boats is carefully planned and executed, with safety and enjoyment in mind. The first resort in many years of diving in Indonesia that insisted on a test dive on arrival...good on them! Guides are European instructors with a wealth knowledge and experience. Only one local DMT so far, but I suspect that the good folk at Komodo will soon be qualifying more locals. One is expected to prep one's own equipment pre-dive[I always prefer to do it anyway] but the boat crew are on hand to assist those who have forgotten. Unfortunately it may not be possible to dive all the well-known Komodo sites in a week, so plan for a long stay.Snorkelling on the resort jetty is great with lots to see. Currents can be strong, so be aware and check with the staff if in doubt.It is not a cheap resort, don't expect a budget holiday. There are ""cheap and cheerful"" options if price is your only criteria, however for a wonderful experience I can heartily recommend this resort.Congrats Luca, Elena and all the other staff members who make it a pleasure for all the guests, in and out of the water"

For the price you pay per night- that fee should be included or paid at the booking time and guests should not be hassled before they even set foot on a boat or the island itself! - not a welcoming start to the whole journey (on top of that- we never went on a diveboat, as we were only snorkeling in the house reef)- secondly, we got picked up from LBJ on a supply boat! we personally did not mind, however it is not very professional having guests sitting in between pumpkins and eggs without a Front of house staff to assist with any queries- guests should be given large bottles of complimentary water- since juices, tea, coffee is not included in the price anywaysALL in ALL:Komodo Resort and Diving Club is a great getaway if you would like some peace and quiet in a laid back atmosphere. Snorkelers are left to their own devices and can easily spend hours in the house reef, whilst divers are taken care of by the owners themselves.All in all a great resort!"
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","Barbara1007","","Sun, sea, sand","We had spent a week aboard the Moana dive boat and came back to the island for 6 days relaxation although my husband continued to dive. The staff were very young training students but pleasant and food acceptable. Although the beach accommodation was clean and spacious this resort is not a luxury resort as it is mainly based around diving. I think it could be improved to accommodate non divers. The spa was a very basic room on the beach and not at all relaxing"
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","kthe","Jakarta, Indonesia","Wonderful solitude","Beautiful beach front cottages, with direct access to wonderful house reef. No question the diving experience was amazing, even compared with Raja Ampat.One exception was that I found it very challenging if you do not like strong currents.The most I took away from this resort was how peaceful and remote it felt. Typically after dusk, we were blessed with complete silence, not even the sound of ocean waves. Few exceptions were the goats, ducks, and crows of course. The dive center was very organized and dive masters were professional and very strict with safety. You will love it!"

If you want exceptional service, an incredible location in the middle of one of the world's least touched reef ecosystem, excellent food, and beautiful sunsets, go to Komodo Resort.The dive staff went above and beyond; the resort staff are friendly and offer exceptional, personalised service; the food is fantastic -- three course Indonesian lunch and four course Italian supper every day (be careful or you'll throw off your buoyancy...). Overall, this was probably the best place we've ever stayed all-around, and particularly so for divers."
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","Jessica C","Shanghai, Shanghai, China","Wonderful dives and food, but other things could be better","Firstly, I will say the dive trips and instructors were really great. We saw amazing sea life and beautiful coral. The food was also delicious, breakfast, lunch and dinner we were always happy and full! Menu was mostly italian with some indonesian dishes, lots of high quality imported wine and food. That being said, we couldn't help feeling the place was overpriced. For the price we were paying and all the 5 star reviews, the resort had little to offer other than dive trips and food. The bungalows were nice, but seemed a little outdated. Service was good, but not great. It sort of seems like they opened a great resort 5 years ago, and then didn't change anything. It was very peaceful at night, but perhaps so much so that it was a little boring. Music in the restaurant or on the dive boat would have been nice. Last tip: If you aren't a diver, there is great snorkeling right on the beach and also you should try and hike up the mountain behind the resort for beautiful views and do some kayaking."
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","Rachel F","United Kingdom","Paradise","I was an inexperience newly qualified OW diver and picked somewhere that is not ""recommended"" for inexperience diver like me! However the instructors are great. They look after me. People working there took note of my every needs, They know where I like to dine, what I drink by default ie water! The whole place is very chill. Diving is fabulous obviously! I am a solo traveler thus when comes to dining, everyone does not sit together like a big family. Every 'hut' has their own table. More geared towards couples. However that does not bother me at all. I dine by the beach and have the company of the sun, the sand and the sea and all those lovely people who served me food to keep me company, Great DM too! Definitely heading back again! Expensive - yes but it's worth it."

It is such a tranquil place, perfect for getting away and doing nothing but snorkeling, eating, watching sunsets, and repeating it all over again! The house reef is beautiful, rich, and lush - literally steps away from the shore. The bungalows are just amazing: clean, beautiful, very spacious, tastefully furnished, and well equipped with anything you need. Hot water and toilets that flush well was a luxury for us after 8 days on a liveaboard. Management and the entire staff are fantastic: they really understand customer service. We were sick unfortunately during most of our stay and they did everything they could to accommodate us and to help - thank you so much for caring for us!

Thanks to good visibility in most of the dive sites this is also great place to stay for free divers. Snorkelling around the resort is just out of this world."
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","prashanth75","Singapore, Singapore","In the lap of luxury .... In the middle of nowhere!!","In the lap of luxury in the middle of nowhere is an understatement to the monumental brilliance of this place. If you are the kind of person that wants the corporate concrete chains kind of luxury then this is not the place for you but in my opinion this is a million times better than any 100-200 room behemoth that has plagued many of the beaches of Bali or the so called Beach dream vacations around the world. What the owners have achieved here is unbelievable, they one day decided yup lets go into the middle of nowhere and build a resort and boy have they built one. They have achieved to build a fully functional resort and not just basic amenities as one would expect in such a remote location. And when you are sitting on the bean bag on beautiful white sand beach watching the most beautiful sunset and sipping on a whisky sour (my poison of choice!), it really dawns upon you the sheer brilliance of this place.There are only 16 bungalows and all of then are right on the beach facing the turquoise waters and couple of beautiful islands in front you. My favorite part of the morning was to pull open the curtain to see the two beach chairs out in front of the stunning water being kissed by the sun and the beautiful island beyond. The actual bed was a bit hard for my liking ( but to each their own!). The room itself is extremely spacious and more than enough for 2 people. The bathrooms are also quite large and they have running hot water. For all of us city slickers who come from the land of excesses, this joint teaches you the meaning of conservation. The island is a dry island, so they have to manufacture their own fresh water OR they need to ship it in from Labuan Bajo. So they do have large drums of salt water to use to flush the toilet and upon checkin they do request you to use that to flush and also be aware of the amount of water you use while showering etc. They clean the rooms in the morning and then they have turn down service in the evening. They would refill your drinking water every morning and if that isn't enough then you can easily walk to the restaurant to top up. One word of advice for those that drink a lot of water, take an extra bottle with you to fill up (the one in the room was too tiny to quench the thirst of two people for us at least, luckily we had our own bottle).The restaurant serves excellent food: The breakfast is a standard buffet with a live omelette station and baked cakes and cookies every morning among other things like pancakes, sausages, bacon, cheese and fruits. The Lunch is Indonesian fare which was very tasty as well. Now the dinner, they serve a proper full 4 course Italian dinner, with starters, pasta, mains and dessert. During your breakfast you will see the menu being written out every day and the staff will come and ask you for your choice for each course, i think this variety for dinner spoilt me and made wish for a bit more variety at breakfast:-)!. The Bar opens up at 5 in the evening and you need to get onto the bean bags and get your view of the beautiful sunset every evening. Alexander at the bar makes brilliant tasting cocktails, his whisky sour was my drink of choice during the week we were there and probably scarfed down a few a day!!Now to the diving, I don't think my wife and I understood the true meaning of ""Pristine Coral Reef"" until we came here. The diving here is breathtakingly beautiful and was made even better by extremely knowledgeable and helpful dive team. The dive resorts we have been too around SE Asia had always changed the tanks and done everything for you, but over here on the boat you need to setup your equipment for the first dive and change your own tank after your first dive. The crew brings all your equipment on to the boat, dont worry you do not have to carry anything, just need to assemble it i.e. connect your BCD and regulator etc. But fret not, the boat crew are always there to give you a helping hand get your equipment setup. The briefing before each dive is so well presented and you can garner from that the high level of knowledge the team has about every dive site. The currents here are unlike we had encountered, but in a good way. I never knew drift diving was so much fun!!! But as always listen to the briefing and follow your dive guide and every thing will be phenomenal. We dived with Leo all through out our stay and he is always smiling and always happy and always willing to help. The entire team of Leo, Luca, Federica, and Engki are just greatWe did have the massage once, i think there is scope for improvement there, but hardly of any concern.Although you will only see a handful, They have 70 indonesian staff working in the background making your stay as brilliant as possible.

The location and topography of the island is idyllic and we witnessed many incredible sunrises and sunsets. The whole friendly team were extremely welcoming, every single staff member saying hello whenever we saw them, gardeners, dive instructors, room cleaners et al. The thatched beachfront cottages are well appointed, being still quite new, with private verandas, all facing the setting sun. Nearby dive sites have everything to suit all levels, and the resort clearly provides what it says on the tin. We were even graced with multiple Mantas on a snorkelling trip! The house reef is a veritable soft coral garden with an amazing diversity of fish, though no large pelagics during our stay. Special mention to our dive guides, Luca, Fredericka, Sam and the rest of the team who made sure we were extremely well briefed and didn't miss anything down below. On our last dive, we were just out of luck in being 100 metres away from another group who hung out with a dugong!The gym has an amazing view but desperately needs a ceiling fan!Being in an isolated location, you cannot expect a large menu, but meals range from an excellent buffet breakfast to Indonesian lunches and Italian dinners with choices of meat, fish and vegetables, all very well cooked and presented. I have a gluten intolerance and took some gluten free ingredients with me, which they prepared. The young girls serving the tables appeared so happy and able to joke multilingually that each meal was a joy.We would recommend the trip to Rinca to see the Komodo Dragons which is combined with a couple of snorkelling stop offs.Special mention for Elena, the resort manager, who colluded online beforehand and went way out of her way to set up a massive surprise for our final night, our actual anniversary. Our eternal thanks Elena, you made it really special together with your chef and those wonderful girls who set up and decorated our veranda for an amazing private dining experience!

It is not the most accessible place but once you get there, it is well worth it. Pros - friendliest staff we have ever experienced at a hotel/resort, authentic and delicious Italian food, most beautiful waters and marine life I have experienced (and I have traveled to the Maldives, Caribbean, Hawaii, Thailand, Tahiti...etc) and did I mention the friendly staff that will bend over backwards to make you happy! A shout out to Antonello (owner), Elena, Sam, Lexi, Lavi, Carolina, Cyrillus, Maya, Mauro (chef) and the rest of the staff. We found out that we had met Mauro, the chef, eleven years ago when we were staying at the Four Seasons in Maldives. He was the chef there back then and somehow managed to make his way to Komodo Resort. They got a world class chef all the way in Komodo! What are the chances?We did a snorkeling trip and since we had grandma with us and she did not swim very well (yes, she had a life vest on), Sam, the dive master, accompanied us and held her hand the whole time. Where else can you get this level of service and thoughtfulness?Cons - Aside from the sandflies, there were none. So remember to use repellent."

Although we had exciting programmes to neighbouring islands every day it was delightful to just swim or snorkel from the shore as there are live coral and schools of fish right at your feet. And of course the view of the islands is superb from any angle. As a huge bonus, we had the most delicious meals, especially the Italian dishes that are prepared meticulously and imaginatively every day by Chef Mauro, his wife and his excellent team. During our stay, the only annoyance we had to put up with was the army of sandflies that refused to leave us alone, especially on our last few days. Otherwise, we had a smashing holiday at this beautiful resort."
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","Eta C","Helsinki","Amazing location and Food","Amazing location and Italian ownership conspire to make this place a rare find. They are fully booked in high season, but it is much better to go when the place is only half full and falls in sync with its tranquil setting. Hard to believe they have been open for a little over two years, because the place runs like clockwork. Foreigners will marvel at the setting, but those who’ve spent significant time in Indonesia will be floored that such a place exists in this country. It has excellent management, super-friendly staff and some of the best diving/snorkeling in the world. The location also stands out for being remote in the best possible sense. Komodo is an archipelago of islands and this place is the only man made object on one of them. This means no traffic, no noise and no pollution. One cannot say how long this will last, because it is rare in the 21st century. Furthermore, it doesn’t lack any of civilization’s key appurtenances. The bungalows are simple, yet tasteful and well equipped. In other words, you will dine and gallivant like a king, despite being in the middle of nowhere. This is a desert island with a barista.The owner has built a fantastic resort and its reputation is not far behind. The staff is very well picked and well trained. The Italian chef manages very well despite the inevitable supply problems. Getting the right olive oil and and pasta in such a location at a reasonable cost is a huge advantage for them. But they do not operate in a bubble. The owner and the manager are fluent in Indonesian and are connected to the local community. I enjoyed spectacular pineapple and bananas here."

"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","Wildlifeimages1","Tucson, Arizona","Paradise Found","My girl friend and I first found Komodo Diving Resort through Trip Advisor in August of last year. We are both SCUBA instructors, have each worked within the industry for literally decades, and have travelled from Antarctica to the High Arctic and many places in between. We had spent 6 weeks on an expedition ship throughout the Kimberley in Australia, and then up into Indonesia. Our trip to Sebayur was a way to wind down and just relax after an intense time. Little did we know how much we would fall in love with this place, and even more so with the people who run it. It was so perfect that we booked again in June of this year, staying for a full 2 weeks!So why in the world return to the same area? Simply stated everything you could possibly expect from Indonesian waters is to be found here at Komodo Diving Resort. All the charismatic megafauna like manta rays, sharks, turtles, but also amazing little critters to make any diver or snorkeler happy. We spent an average of 6 hours a day in the water, exploring every nook and cranny of the house reef. We punctuated these days with boat trips to all the must see areas, and they were all amazing, but I cannot stress enough how fascinating the house reef is.It is so easy to get into and out of the water literally right in front of your bungalow. Time spent in and around the dock yielded so many photo opportunities. Then just drifting with the tide as it changed allowed us to cover great distances and yet stay perfectly safe. One of our snorkel sessions lasted five and a half hours...it was that magical (cuttlefish mating)! Whether you are a beginning snorkeler, or a seasoned diver, you must allow yourself the pleasure of the house reef. Night snorkeling on this reef is a priority as well...The bungalows themselves are about as perfect as you can get. Clean, spacious, comfortable. The bathroom is ingeniously separate from the living area with plenty of HOT water and space to dry out your wetsuit or diveskin. Fresh water is always a concern on an island without any, so you have the OPTION of using salt water to flush the toilets, which are western style, or simply use them as you would at home. Air conditioning cools your bungalow quickly and efficiently, even when you leave it off while you are out diving or snorkeling. The views from the lanai are spectacular. Bungalows are spaced far enough apart that you hear or see very little of your neighbors.And now to the best part of the entire place; the people who make your vacation the best it can be. Owner Antonello is on site and seemingly everywhere. A true Renaissance man who helped design and build the entire resort. Still an avid diver and guide and a wealth of knowledge for the entire area. A reliable resource for whatever questions you might have...Elena is the perfect hostess, making sure you are comfortable and well looked after. She is an avid diver herself and will help you make the best decisions for just where you want to go and what you want to do. The trip to Rinca to see the dragons is a must and she will facilitate that for you.Head chef Mauro prepared scrumptious meals worthy of a fine restaurant (like the 2 he owned and operated in Italy prior to coming to Indonesia)! Meal times are spread out and you can come and eat at your leisure. Meat, fish, and vegetarian options allow many choices for all. Try the Granita for dessert!And then the Indonesian staff, nearly 70 of them in total. Everybody from the girls who serve the meals, to the guys who load and fill all the gear and tanks for diving, to the groundskeepers who keep the place spotless, to the folks who clean the bungalows. These people are the life blood of this resort. Truly a delight and it is obvious that they are committed to your enjoyment of Komodo Diving Resort.Perhaps the best way for me to tell you how much we love this place is that we are looking at booking it again in 2016. It is that amazing...Mille grazie Antonello e Elena. A presto!"

It is perfectly located so you cut down on boat time to the dive sites. Bungalows are great with own sun beds. Food is superb with Indonesian lunch and Italian dinner with suprisingly broad offer of wines. Diving is world class, and we saw plenty of Mantas including the all black. However, dives are in very strong current and not for beginners. In addition, there is a great house reef for the non-divers or the over active. Highly recommended place!"

Customer service was top notch! Dive instructors and guides were accomplished, professional, and extremely helpful. I had not dived such strong currents before and was able to learn so much from everyone! And, everyone was so patient with me and my camera set up. The food was amazing -- set menus to choose from, usually featuring Italian or Indonesian cuisine. The staff were attentive and so very friendly. Yes, we had some complications leaving the area with the volcano eruption, but if I could have stayed on the island longer, I would have!! Bonus: good wifi in the common areas. Though, I would have enjoyed my stay just as much without it. Was able to connect in other ways! The most amazing sunsets right outside your door, the Milky Way overhead and night, and waves slowly lulling you to sleep after a long day in the sun and water... perfection!!"

We decided for Komodo Resort mainly because it is close to Rinca Island (Komodo dragons) and, as snorkelers, for its house-reef. What we didn't know was how amazing is the people who run the hotel, from the staff to the management (Elena and Antonello). If you're not a diver you can easily snorkeling in front of the bungalows, even with low tide or you can simply relax on the beach. In the area there are lot of spots for snorkelers (we saw Manta rays, sharks and turtles) or divers and the hotel can help you arrange daily trips. The sunset on the hill behind the hotel is a must. Grey herons, eagles, kingfishers are other guests you can see on the island.Thank you Komodo Resort"

Diving is fantastic,saw a lot of animals that we didn't see in our first dive at great barrier reef.saw a few Manta Rays. Diving conditions can be challenging for newer divers at certain sites due to currents. The house reef is fantastic, and we wished that we spent more time snorkelling there. The reef is literally off the beach. In fact, we had trouble putting on our fins as the reef was so close to the shore. Staff were all happy, friendly, and made us feel at ease. The divermasters, Leo and Patris had safety in mind at all times, but we're really helpful. We really enjoyed ourselves, and it is money well spent. The only fault I would say is bad WiFi, but you shouldn't be using WiFi in a paradise like that, not while there is so much more to do."
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","pumps23","","An absolutely enjoyable holiday","The resort is beautiful and the view is breathtaking, but the best thing about this place is the people who run it and the people who serve you day in day out. The owner we met, Antonello, is a delightful man who makes great effort to train his staff. We found that really heartening especially because the resort provides meaningful jobs to people around the area. Elena, Leo and Luca are always cheerful and ready to share their experiences on the island with guests. Leo was amazing on the dive trips; always helpful and watching out for us. Sam, who was our snorkeling guide, is a gem and we really enjoyed our snorkeling trips with him. We loved the cocktails by Leksie which we enjoyed in the beautiful sunset every evening, before the sumptuous 3-course dinner every night by the resident Italian chef! We should mention that the sky here becomes star-studded by 6:30pm every night - it's beautiful and our non-DSLR camera does the sky no justice. Thank you to all the smiley ladies and gentlemen working in the restaurant, for making every meal such an experience. Even though the resort is on a remote island (the very reason why everyone should visit this place), it has everything you need for an unforgettable holiday, including good massages and a good selection of wines! The staff at the resort will also bend over backwards to organise any day trips you might want to experience and we highly recommend the flying foxes tour. This resort is a must-visit for everyone who enjoys the beach, the sea and the sun - and abundance of excellent service :) The people here truly believe in what they do, and we really admire and respect that."

Everything works perfect, from the moment they pick you up at the airport until you unfortunately need to get back there to leave Komodo. The hotel is located is a small island isolated from everything, so expect plenty of time to relax, I took the diver package so I had my dives in the morning and the afternoon to just explore around, relax at the beach or simply sleep a bit. All the staff is very friendly, and they really try to make you feel comfortable, Helena was always always keen to help, or give advice about different options, or just simply chat with you, and that was a common thing with all the rest. My dive instructor Leo, was extremely good, very professional and willing to improve your diving skills, and the dive sites well, they were just amazing, I had one of the coolest dives where apart from the corals, plenty of fishes... we saw at least 6 green turtles, and that was only one of the dives. I also did the afternoon trip to Rinca to see the Dragons, and although we saw one next to the entrance that looked almost like placed there, at the end of the trail we managed to see one moving through the bushes and really looking as what you would expect them to be. As for the bungalows they fit perfectly in the environment, the inside is simple but comfortable, and special mention to the food, really good!! So I just can say yes, it is not the cheapest option, but it also gives you a lot more than what you usually get in South East Asia."
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","Rowie_aus","","Thanks to the team for an excellent mini break","My partner and I had an excellent 4 day trip to Komodo Dive Resort.The team were very hospitable and did their utmost to make guests feel welcome, relaxed and fed. Special thanks to Leo, our dive instructor for the first two days who was the consummate professional and showed a real commitment to ensuring the safety and enjoyment of divers. We had some great dives and had a Manta swim right over us, one of the highlights of my diving experience so far.My tip to travellers is that this is an excellent place for divers and snorkelers but if you want to see the Komodo dragons do as much research as possible before you go on the best way to see them. We squeezed in a 90 minute walk on Rinca (after the 2 morning dives and a longer than expected boat ride to get there) as the sun was starting to go down.We did see 4-5 dragons but only around the main office and we suspect are very well fed (like house pets!). We learnt after the Rinca trip that the the best time to see the dragons is in the morning and even then you are quite lucky to see them in their natural habitat on Rinca as they generally stay in the shrubs. We did hear some reports of spectacular sightings of other guests but we weren't so lucky. Also the guides can be a bit hesitant to take you on long walks so a bit of persuasion is necessary."
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","functionalforms","Pondicherry, India","Great place to be in for diving","It's difficult to describe in words our experience of this place so i'll try and keep to the standards. Right from the pickup to the drop to airport - the service has been excellent. Genuinely friendly people - and not just the owner but every staff member right down to the non-English speaking gardener! Komodo resort is on an island - so the whole staff team is like one large family and and the rapport they share results also in great service. Location is of course unbeatable. The corals as you just wade out into the waters are amazing. Room is beautifully done. Though there was a dreamy mosquito netting provided, we didn't use it and preferred to keep our windows open at night. Didn't use air conditioning as the natural ventilation was excellent. Rooms are about 8 meters from the sea!Food is just great. The cook seems to enjoy churning out meal after interesting meal. On the first day that we landed i was a bit overwhelmed with the quantity of food and worried about wastage. But portions were quickly altered to suit our needs. Menus are discussed individually every morning and the days meals are set at breakfast. So we are told what's the menu for lunch / dinner and we can choose from a couple of different options. The options were interesting enough to try various things over our 5 night stay. Surprise food of great interest for me were the quail eggs and an excellent crab dish. Western cuisine was great but Indonesian was also superb.Snorkeling right in front of the rooms is a feast with so many corals and fish. Diving was amazing. Not just because of the wonderful fish and coral life under but what made it really special for the extra care that the instructors take. Komodo resort does have good diving spots within easy reach but i am an 'uneasy' diver having learnt to swim quite late in life. So i was nervous about the current - having had Luca to first kit us up and Leo taking us on the dives we felt safe. I haven't felt as safe underwater as with Leo. Antonello - the owner of komodo resorts, an italian with a big and friendly heart, is himself an ardent diver. So safety, care and an understanding of every person coming to dive has been given great importance at this resort. I'd definitely love to go to this place again.I think what i liked best about this place is the easy relaxed atmosphere in the resort and the care that was given to a 'shy' diver such as myself."
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","michelle404","","Not sure if it was worth the price tag.","The accommodation is nice. Rooms are basic but comfortable. The downside for us was that the hot water ran out quickly and a number of wasps found their way into the room. We were surprised by the aircon surcharge when it was asked that you use it as little as possible. The location is beautiful. The island location certainly saves time getting around Komodo. The kitchen and waitstaff are exceptional. We can't fault the food (very generous with many courses). They had European dishes and lovely cheese too.The diving however was hit and miss. The final two dives were sensational but the previous few were average. We were partnered with other divers who had varied skill levels which limited the scope for dives. One diver didn't have certification while another didn't follow instruction from the guide. Having additional Indonesian guides may be a better way forward. Overall our experience was mixed. If you are mad for diving perhaps consider a liveaboard. My husband wishes we had."

I've never seen anywhere so beautiful and unspoilt. There is no rubbish. The managers and staff as so friendly and helpful, and come chat to you every day about the next day's dive sites etc. The food is amazing. The diving was spectacular and the best we have seen, and very professionally run and safe too. The bungalows were comfy, air conditioned and right on the beautiful house beach.

New airports, scheduled daily flights, and boat ride out was much easier than we anticipated. With the speedboat it was only 25 minutes, and with the Large Slower Boat about 1 1/2 hours of enchanting scenery. Cruising around many islands jutting straight out of the water to weave around, it was really spectacular. The flight from Bali took us on a short flight to Labuan Bajo, ,Flores, where the pier is literally 10 minutes drive (no traffic!) to their private Boat waiting to transfer you to this Amazing and Eco friendly Paradise.The entire Komodo Marine Park is unbelievably clean, we saw NO LITTER floating anywhere - and anyone we spoke to in Labuan Bajo (35 dive operators) all were in accord with Conservation for their blessed environment.We are Not divers, but snorkel and were really impressed with not only the many sites for coral viewing, but the House Reef. That was a truly unique experience, and straight out front of the resort! We saw many colours of hard and Soft Corals, as well as Nudibranches, Clownfish, Angelfish, Trevelly, Jacks and basically a kaleidoscope of fish and coral colours, every colour under the rainbow actually! On all the trips the assortment of marine life was phenomenal. We swam for over an hour with 8 Manta Rays just on the first day! Second day More Mantas! Huge Sea Turtles, A couple of larger Octopus, Napoleon Wrasse, Big Jacks, Many Micro Fish full of florescent colours! What was also Unique, was the sealife waits for you to finish viewing them! (Very Polite), we always left them, to go see more, at another place, or return for Dinner! Also we went to Rinca. I was with my 2 sons, and knew that would be a highlight. What boy doesn't want to see a real life Dragon? We saw 4 larger Dragons andwe were lucky enough to see 2 juvenile Komodo Dragons. One was leading the way on our hiking path - our guide said he was ...our 1st guide! Another polite animal - in the Marine park! One must wear sturdy shoes for the hiking.We used the kayaks, were on daily boating/ snorkel island viewing trips/ lots of feasting on the many courses and plentiful menu. The dining area is Divine! Who has Italian Marble tables in a beachfront openair Dining Room? They do- they really had oudone themselves, again, in the Dining and Drinks department. There was Plenty to do. Upstairs was a gorgeous wooden upstairs TV and DVD room with exercise equipment, but we never needed the extra entertainment - I had a massage which was super and they were building a lovely wooden massage space on the beachfront while we were there. We went to Komodo island resort in hopes of Paradise and a well preserved Marine Park and this was Exactly what we found.The resort itself is quite amazing. I certainly didn't expect to find beautiful Italian linen, gorgeous wooden handcrafted furnishings, lots of space in the villas for unpacking, small stylish reading lamps, plush bedding, clean ample filtered water always available, Giant bathroom with Eco-Friendly amenities, Tasteful and immaculate Wooden beachfront Villas with unreal views of the many stunning islands across the crystal clear water from your sliding wood/glass door. A lovely front porch with plentiful drying space and sitting space to watch the sunset was just a BONUS!The resort is run by 2 Italian gentlemen, and the attention to detail shows everywhere. Their dedication to conservation is apparent and their passion for conservation addictive. When we returned home, to Western Australia, we became more conservative of water. It was suggested to be aware and respect the water use, as well as all aspects to retain the pristine environment. Well it works, and now our everyday life is more water conscious. I cannot recommend a better place to stay for Enjoying the pristine environment of the Komodo Marine Park.We will return again, and again!Jen Michael and Eric"
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","Umnada","","Amazing place","My friends and I arrived at this resort and were met by a bubbly manager who explained in details about the resort. First and foremost water is an important commodity and so we had to be careful using it. The chalets are right on the beach , very clean though dark inside. The air condition worked well which is a plus, as we were in another 5 star resort in Ubud prior to coming here where the air condition was struggling.The resort is on an all inclusive basis, and the owner is Italian, so be prepared to eat pasta everyday, though the menu for both lunch and dinner were quite extensive. Breakfast was a bit limited, but on the whole we had a lovely time with snorkeling just on your front door, and daily dives arranged. Take extra cash if you plan to visit Rinka island to see the Komodo dragons, and dont miss out on this, as this is the only place in the world where you ll find these giant lizards. Overall great place, very clean, rooms and public places, amazing beach front chalets, good menu, friendly and very helpful staff. Heaven on earth"
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","andal03","Northport, New York","Best diving experience, but not a five star resort","It somewhat troubles me to not give this place 5 stars, but I feel that several thing should be made aware to other travelers. If you are an avid diver like myself, this is the very best corals and diversity I have seen - even right outside your room for snorkeling. However, if you are traveling with somebody who is not that much into diving it wouldn't be as good an experience. Let me provide some insight to other travelers and the resort itself at the risk of sounding a bit like a snob. First, when you are greeted at the airport, we usually get wet towels to refresh ourselves and when we have a 45 minutes boat ride we would expect cold water to be provided - it is very hot. Second, the food was not five or four stars, but lacked in imagination and several basic things were not available, like selection of teas, different options for eggs and some decent food for vegetarian. Third, I did find some of the diving equipment somewhat overused, not a problem if you are a serious diver and bring your own, but I had expected better equipment. That being said, the staff is awesome, the place gorgeous and if you love diving or snorkeling it is absolutely a paradise. We also loved the trip we took to see the Komodo Dragons, snorkeling was great, lunch decent, but staying under the covers upstairs watching Dolphins and other boats sailing past was a perfect way to travel. One word of advise- get an air conditioning room.....it is hot. The import question is always - would you go again, and for me that is a big yes. The place is just amazing for divers, but I would let my wife stay at the resorts in Bali. "

The daily trips to the National Park are just what you would expect from it and the little island where the resort is it's great. I mean, don't expect a ""resort"" ni the fancy way, have to keep in mind it is located in a national park right in the middle of nowhere in a tinny island. But the installations and service are outstanding. Everybody is so nice and helpful and the rooms/bungalows are stunning. The beach around the pier is just unbeliabably good for snorkeling (please try night snorkeling, you will be amazed!). As I professional diver I have nothing but compliments to them. Great people, great professionals, great dive sites, great boats and crew, nothing to complain about.If you have the chance to dive with them or just to spend a few days and visit the park you won't regret!"

Not only are the villas/huts beautiful and private, but the food and staff were excellent. We didn't dive - friends of ours did and raved about it. We snorkeled and of all the places we've been, it was by the far the best! There's a reef right outside your door step, which we took advantage of almost every day. We still talk about the experience and I doubt anything will top it! If you have a chance to visit Indonesia - this place should be top on your list!"

From the first minute of a sincere welcome from Elena to waving her off at the dock, our visit just could not be improved upon! The staff, both dive and resort, are brilliant, they cannot do enough for you and are a delight to get to know; the accommodation is spacious, spotlessly clean and literally on the beach; the food is first class, more than enough choice for everyone to be happy and to gain a few pounds and finally, the diving -superb - a few rip roaring currents but always kept safe by our dive guide and masses to see. The house reef is also amazing, one of the best we have visited. The trip to Rinca to see the Komodo Dragons is also well woth doing. All in all, we had a fantastic stay at this resort and look forward to returning there one day, thank you to Antonello and all his staff for making it work so well"

The place has the feel of an idyllic paradise where everybody can do nothing but smile and be spoiled by the people, fish, coral and island! It would be great to have spent more time out there but alas......Even if you are not a diver, it is worth the trip and defintely get out on the dive boats on their daily trips and snorkle the magnificent waters.And as mentioned, the staff, they are great; interact with them as much as you can!"

After landed in Labuan Bajo Airport, not too long waited, employee from resort picked us with boat from Labuan Bajo port to the resort, it took around 45 minutes. And...paradise just outspread in our eyes, white sand, blue water, and Elena were welcoming us in that resort very warmly. We stayed around 4 days and 3 nights. Accompanied by Italian foods which were served so delicious, i got my weight up around 5 kilos...hahaha... Please prepare your sunbath cream and enjoy your tanning time, while sleeping on the beach. I took dived 6 times and we found Manta Ray...not only one, two or three, but around ten manta ray. Not only manta ray, but we found baby shark, barracuda, sea turtle and many else and don't forget...a beautiful colorful coral view. At the last day, We traveled in the morning to komodo national park, saw the habitat of komodo dragon and back afternoon. We walked around our island, hiked hill behind our cottage and found perfectly sunset...you should try this...All of the trip was wonderful... :)"
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","Bupuffy","Hong Kong, China","An amazing resort with an excellent house reef","Visiting Komodo Resort and Diving Club is not easy. We took a domestic flight from Bali to Labuan Bajo where we need to take another 1.5 hour boat ride to the resort. We stayed in Bali the night before and caught up with an early flight the next morning.The resort is relatively small with just 16 Bungalows. The owners are Italian and most of the staff are from Europe. There are about 60 staff serving the maximum occupancy of 40-43 guests. On arrival, we were greeted the the manager Elenor. We came to Komodo mainly for diving. We were totally satisfied with our diving in the resort.We started on dive with a check dive in the afternoon in the day of arrival. Normally there were two morning dives. Afternoon dives and night dives are arranged upon request on an extra costing. The boat leaves around 8am and by 1pm all will be back for lunch. We were led by different DMs, either local Indonesian as well as Europeans. My wife and I were quite satisfied with the standard and guidance. The only thing that one may have a word is that the divers have to set up the gears and change the tank by themselves. We almost saw sharks and big stuff everyday. Small critters were also easy to see with the help of DMs. Since there were only two morning dives, we dare not to use Nitrox as it did not make a lot of difference to us.The house reef is wonderful and it's one of the best we have ever seen. A big school of Trevally seemed to be there everyday!They serve Continental breakfast, Indonesian lunch and Italian dinner. The quality was excellent, almost ""Michelin"" standard under such a remote environment and location. The room was spacious with a balcony overlooking the beach. It could be quite hot in midday, it would be nice to choose a AC bungalow if possible.We traveled to Komodo Island to see the Komodo Dragons. On the way back, we stopped by the Pink Beach and Manta Point. The Pink Beach gave you a pink colour because of the sand. Snorkeling in the Pink Beach was not as good as in the house reef. The Manta Point Snorkeling is something worth mentioning. We jumped into the water but there was no manta. Our guide Sam, a local Indonesian staff insisted on doing one more times. We hopped on teh speed boast again and this time we saw two mantas. The experience was so wonderful for our kids as they never saw such a big creature swimming under their belly. My younger boy was very scared in the first instance when he saw it and tried to swim away!In summary, this is a cozy resort with not too many guests. It's a place where you may feel the staff have an intimate care and service to you. We always compare Wakatobi Dive Resort with Komodo Resort and Diving Club. I think both have their merits in different aspects. Wakatobi seems better in a sense that it provides a camera room for divers which is quite near the Long House. This facilitates divers very much especially for those serious UW photographers. But I am sure that Komodo resort may have this facility sooner or later."

The boat ride to the resort from Labuan Bajo gets you warmed up for what's to come. But nothing can prepare you for the sheer beauty of the resort and island that you find once you get there. I don't want to spoil the experience, so just a few quick pointers below: - the bungalows are beautiful, super clean, and eco-friendly - it doesnt get much better than this- the house reef is better for snorkeling than literally all the spots we visited on a day tour from labuan bajo to komodo park - on our last morning, we saw four turtles within an hour!!- the day trip to rinca island is fantastic and the snorkeling on the way back phenomenal (we swam with manta rays and visited the most impressive coral garden i've ever seen)- when back at the resort and before or after dinner, go have a drink at the bar. with the music on, sitting at the beach with a cocktail on your table on a remote island with no other resort than this one, you truly feel like a filmstar!the only thing that could perhaps improve is the dining. the meals are huge, nicely presented and lovely, but a simpler and more diverse (or less Italian/European take) menu might be a welcome addition. the price certainly looks steep when compared to other places in labuan bajo, but we definitely think it's worth it. you get paradise at your doorstep, extremely good service with everyone of the staff being very nice and helpful, and a not-to-forget experience that will make everyone happy. thanks Elena and your team for an unforgettable stay - we thought Komodo Resort was the highlight of our entire trip!!"

What we found instead, was something out of a dream. As soon as we stepped foot on the boat to take us to Sebayur, we were greeted by the friendly staff. The ride was about 1.5 hours and pleasant. The upper deck had big bean bags which made the ride more enjoyable. As we approached the island I was so thrilled to see how beautiful it was with the aquamarine water, white sand and the lovely bungalows with thatching. We had the good fortune of getting to know some of the other guests and we decided to pull our tables together so we could visit during our meals. The staff left our tables together for us each day so we could all eat together. The staff was friendly and accomodating at every turn. I expected to be roughing it much more, but the food was great and they provide plenty of it. Trust me, you will not go hungry. The bungalows are simple but clean and spacious. The diving instructors were all very knowledgeable and I appreciated our diving instructor's (Leo) never-ending patience with us. I have problems equalizing my ears, but I never once felt pressured to be quick instead he made sure the dive was comfortable and safe. Before each dive, we were shown a diagram of the diving site and instructed on any difficulties we might encounter and what to do. After our dives, they had a snack of buiscuits and hot tea or water on the boat. The owner, Antonello was a fantastic host. He was friendly and very likable, and extremely generous, as we found out, when I discovered I had forgotten my contact lenses. He gave me some of his own contact lenses to use so that I could see during the dive. I would have never expected that, but he went out of his way to make sure our needs were met. I could write a book about this place there are so many good things. It is one of the best trips we have had-- there were good diving sites (even right next to the resort), so much sea life and coral, a spectacular retreat on the island (you really do feel like you are far away from it all), and great staff. If you are fortunate enough to make it there, and you have a chance to visit the the "" secret pink beach,"" don't miss out! It is stunning and pristine. Thanks to Antonello and all the staff at Sebayur for a wonderful time."

The islands are surprisingly green which gives a pleasant contrast with the blue sea. We were met on the jetty by Elena the manageress who went out of her way to be friendly and helpful at all times. All other staff smiled and were ready to assist. The rooms are well appointed and are air conditioned which is welcome in the humid and hot weather. Our main reason for going to the island was for diving and we found the DM's to be very thorough and competent. Dive sites were varied and the water warm although we did experience some raging currents at times. Nearly every night whilst sitting at the beach bar there was a spectacular sunset which was stunning. Food at the hotel was varied and plentiful. Excursions can be arranged and we visited the nearby Komodo island where we went into the National Park and saw 10 dragons (they are huge) and buffalo. This was a very worthwhile visit. Thoroughly enjoyed the stay at Komodo Resort and would not hesitate to recommend it."

But I needn't have worried! The island is one of the driest islands in the archipelago and even though we could see the clouds gathering over the main island (Flores, where Labuan Bajo is located) every afternoon, they never seemed to reach us. The staff at the resort are wonderful and so accommodating, Elena, I don't know how you keep track of everyone's wants and needs so well! The huts are not huts, but very comfortable, air-conditioned, en-suite rooms, very stylish and clean. The restaurant serves a set menu with 2 or 3 choices which changes each day. The food is great, Indonesian for lunch and Italian for dinner, with a lovely little beach bar for reasonably priced pre-dinner drinks and watching the sunset. As everyone has mentioned, the house reef is amazing! I don't dive but was more than thrilled with the snorkelling. The rest of the family were thrilled with the diving, which was well organised and professionally conducted. Can't recommend this place and the people there enough. It's definitely worth visiting and do it soon, before it becomes spoilt. Labuan Bajo now has a new airport and the government are promoting it as THE next tourist destination!!"
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","mfretz","Hettlingen","Perfect Stay in a Beautiful Location","Arriving there by boat we were not stunned but certainly stupefied as the Islands looked almost like Egypt: some green at the banks of the Nile and behind the dunes (almost bare hills). It's in fact a very dry area which makes it fully intelligible you are advised to save fresh water. Anyway, the nice bungalows are spacious with a covered, sometimes hot Veranda and outstanding view plus white beach in front. Enjoy the most beautiful sunsets of SE-Asia at the bar. The alternation of Indonesian and fine Italian food leaves you with almost no unsatisfied desires. Both Indonesian and Italian staff are friendly and very helpful (including office mgr, DMs and boat crew). The northern Komodo region is a fantastic diving area providing an incredibly rich maritime life at a number of spots. The boats are unusually spacious and provide a shaded ""sun deck"" (you probably do not wish to get too much of the burning sun), comfortable thus. The boat staff frees you of almost any work with your diving gear - however breathing ought to be done by yourself. Most DMs are capable and very nice, particularly Frederica. Only minuses are maybe that the tide movements do not always allow to visit all the possible, partially remote spots. And the Indonesian kitchen actually is richer than the provided one. If you wish to extend your dinner at the bar you should hurry a little bit as the bar tender tends to close the shop early if there are no guests at near sight.Unlike most other visitors, the four of us stayed entire two weeks. And we did not regret a single second spent at the Komodo Resort. All in all a perfect stay to be repeated and to be recommended."

As such, it is the perfect location for anyone seeking to dive or snorkel in the Komodo National Park - or see the dragons. Beautiful teak bungalows are stretched along the beach either side of the central bar and restaurant area. Each bungalow was designed in a traditional Balinese style, to the owner's specific design. They are roomy, comfortable and very well appointed. The food is excellent, with Indonesian food at lunchtime, followed by Italian cuisine in the evening. A choice is always available - as are three courses from the hungry! The diving operation is very well managed and transfers to the dive sites are obviously much shorter than they would be from Labuanbajo. The staff are a mixture of European and Local - and cannot be faulted. I highly recommend this resort to you"

I was sure to find a beautiful and pristine place, since I had a look on the pics and on the other reviews.. but as soon as I put my feet on the pier my mouth was stuck open and my eyes were enchanted ! beautiful place.. cozy huts very clean and spacious.. nothing is missing.  10 steps far from the bungalow you have an awesome house reef.. full of fish and healthy corals. you can snorkel here for days and you never get bored.. you can either do some kayaking but pay attention to the current, it can be very strong.. also, we went out following the divers boat and we saw manta rays and plenty of fishes in some beautiful spots. boats are comfortable, with a big sun deck with bean bag chairs to relax.staff is one of the best I found here in Indonesia. all very young but attentive, helpful, friendly, smiling all the time .. you can feel they are happy to stay and work there and this makes you feel even more like at home. We knew we were going on a remote island where you might not expect  high level of cuisine.. well, I had to change my mind.. food is simply SUPERB ! both Indonesian food and Italian food are simple but delicious. we spent a week and we had never eaten the same dish, the best food I had in Indonesia! Nothing to say, memorable holiday. one of my favorite place ever.. congratulations to the whole team for the wonderful job they are doing.

Only minus would be that there was probably too much of it (not sure if this is a minus!) and Italian cooking can be a tad rich in a tropical island setting. Dive operation had great attention to detail, safety and responsibility without being overbearing. Each dive was introduced with a thorough briefing and hand drawn map over the dive site. Huts are spacious and comfy; lovely crisp white sheets and towels, steaming hot water and useful attention to detail like outside light switches that glow in the dark. We took the deluxe AC option which was modern quiet and efficient and we needed as it was very hot at his time of year. Oh and of course Komodo is the most stunning archipelago so the diving and scenery are outstanding! Thank you.

The hotel room actually is a bungalow, its very comfortable actually with a stunning view, and we were really impressed that they are trying to be more environmental friendly for example they ask all guests using salt water to flush the toilet after use ( so they will prepare a huge bucket of salt water inside the bathroom )Since theres nothing on the island except the hotel ,so hotel will provide all the italian / indo food for you, and I can say its the best diving resort food ever, I can feel they did put lot of effort for getting the italian ingredients and italian chef really did a great job! we were looking forward to the meal time everyday!For a diver, the resort just like an heaven on earth, we did 2-3 dives a day ( together with a very good DM ) for the remaining time, we either lying on the sunbathe bench or kayaking along the area or snorkeling ( and its the best snorkeling place ever in my life! ) so if you are not divers you can still have some fun but yeah maybe stay 3 nights, for divers i think at least 1 week there, unfortunately we didnt have that much time :( you will love it for sure if you wanna dive and sleeping on the solid ground with great food and facilities i wish i can be back next year for more diving!"

To travel from Labuan Bajo each day to the dive destinations is really quite a long way. Off LBJ, there are only 3 options - Angel Resort, Kanawa Resort or Komodo Resort. Komodo Resort was perfect as it was further out than the other options, so each day we had greater access to dive destinations. Besides its location, I was amazed at the services that were provided to us on such a remote island. The rooms were beautiful, the hospitality spot on and the food was good. They also have a new bar which is perfect for sunset drinks, along with great day beds on the water for those not wanting to dive (and a top house reef for snorkelling). For those interested in staying close to Komodo dive sites and still enjoying great hospitality, I couldn't recommend this place more."
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","Spud_666","Los Gatos, CA","Diving was great but what a house reef...","I picked the Komodo Resort because of its location on Sebayur Island out in the middle of the sea between Labuan Bajo and Komodo. I didn't want to deal with the extra time it would take to get out from Labuan Bajo to a dive spot and given the speed of most of the boats in the area (slow) it was a wise choice.The diving was almost everything I would have hoped it would be. Great reefs and lots of sea life. I saw things I hadn't seen before. I just wish I had seen more big schools of apex fish. Not sure why I didn't. Could have been bad luck. I hope it wasn't because Komodo is in danger of being fished out.The service at the resort was fine. You are given options for lunch and dinner meals and the breakfast is served buffet style. Like other operators the dive boats at the resort are not the fastest on the planet. Those who are used to high speed fiberglass boats that one would would find in places like Palau, where you could journey 30 miles for a dive, are in for a bit of a culture shock. Not that I'm complaining mind you. I hit plenty of quality dive spots but the lack of speed did limit our range to the North and east sides of Komodo and I was left wondering what there was on the West and South sides. I want to make special note of the resort's house reef. I haven't snorkeled everywhere in the world but this was easily the best snorkeling I've ever had. Given its location I would have been let down if it wasn't this good. I saw Barracuda in five feet of water. I never see Barracuda this close to shore. Other schools of open ocean fish also came by. And the soft and hard corals are in very good condition.We caught some bad luck with the moon. It was waxing from crescent to full while we were there which blotted out the stars for six of our nights there. But the first night took my breath away. I never saw the Milky Way galaxy in all its glory like that before. I would definitely come back here again. But I'd have to scratch Raja and Lembeh off my list first."

We not big pasta eaters so dinner was not the highlight of our meals.If you don't dive there is nothing else to do so keep that in mind if only one half dives.Although it was a Eco resort and again one of the best accommodation for a diving resort in Asia, they had air con which is great but you had no flushing toilets which I think if I knew I would not of stayed.Staff was friendly but as a none diver I had to wait until the divers returned at lunchtime yo get a juice."
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","biketrekker","Singapore","""A touch of Italy in Komodo Dragon-land""","Had we stuck to our original plans, Sangeang Api's unexpected eruption would have aborted our stay at Komodo Resort. Instead, Garuda Indonesia's unrelated - and initially unwelcome - rescheduling of flights from Denpasar to Labuan Bajo probably worked in our favour and the only daily reminder of Sangeang Api's eruption at Komodo Resort is the thin layer of volcanic ash that covers unattended items left outdoors. And the gentle swirl of tiny ash particles in the beam of one's torch at night.The great deal of thought that brought Komodo Resort into being and sustains its existence is evident in the architecturally imaginative use of eco-friendly local materials in the buildings; 24x7 electricity; 1-hour/day free WiFi at the restaurant and office (more than adequate, in our case); high-quality Indonesian and Italian meals; young, enthusiastic, friendly and well-trained multi-lingual local staff.The two de luxe bungalows that five of us occupied have air-conditioning, ceiling -fan and -lights, electronic safe, full-sized wardrobe, writing desk, twin beds with LED reading lights, and a convenient waist-high wooden shelf running along the length of the bungalow on both sides. The 4-gang multi-plug extension cord that we brought along ensured no shortage of electricity outlets for charging our cameras, smartphones, iPads and Eneloop batteries. Fresh drinking water is supplied daily in a pitcher. The bungalows are cleaned daily and a nightly turndown service includes deployment of mosquito nets over each bed. The large verandah was perfect for hanging wet gear to dry and lazing in balmy evenings.The bathroom is big and well-lit. Effectively a wet room, it features a washbasin with large mirror and vanity lights, a shower with hot and cold running water in one corner next to a sit-down flush toilet. Used toilet paper is disposed of in a small bin to avoid clogging the toilet system. A tub of seawater is replenished daily so that Eco-conscious guests can use it for flushing the toilet. Good quality bath and hand towels are provided and each guest also has a microfiber bath towel to bring along for boat dives and water sports.The bungalows are located in the morning shadow of the ridge that forms Pulau Sebayur's spine. The late afternoon sun is ameliorated by the shade of a long island across the strait.The house reef is one of the most beautiful I have encountered and a great venue for snorkelling. 20-40 minutes away via dive boat are famous scuba diving sites like Batu Bolong, Pulau Siaba Kechil and Makasa Reef (aka ""Manta Point"" from Nov-Mar, when it's eponymous namesake is reportedly abundant). Currents can be strong to very strong in some of these sites but are worth braving for the pristine beauty - when in doubt, abort the dive!We didn't have any memorable encounters with pelagics but the abundance and diversity of healthy corals in a myriad colors I'd not previously experienced remains foremost in my mind.Also memorable were excursions to Rinca island to witness Komodo Dragons in their natural habitat and the boat excursion at dusk to see thousands of hungry giant-sized fruit bats soaring across the sea from Pulau Kalong to feed in Flores and Pulau Rinca. Would we go back? Most certainly!"

Keep in mind the boat (or our boat at least) goes painfully slow (almost 2u!!)... but hey, once you arrive, all is forgotten and you are warm welcomed by all the staff. The staff in this resort is extraordinary !! Bungalows are supercool and couldn't be happier with it. Perhaps next time i'll definitly consider aircon instead of fan... wow, it was quite hot....:)The food.... i'm a fan! Everything tasted very good with the spaghetti carbonara as my favorite dish! The only thing i would recommend them to do is to offer something in the afternoon (a little snack, cake, ...) because between lunch and dinner, stomachs tend to make some noises ;) and since you're on an island and there is no shop to buy something.... could be an improvement in my humble opinion.The diving was ok but it's the reason they don't get 5 star rating from me.My checkdive was totally NOT ok (practically no briefing, debriefing and the equipement is in pretty poor condition and i didn't have the right size!) and i had to wait more than 1 hour on 2 other divers who had just arrived... Was very disappointed and talked afterwards with the divemanager. Was a good talk and he arranged the right equipement for my next dives but still, the zipper of my wetsuit was broken, one of my fins was teared up .... pffffffBut all considered, the diving itself is pretty amazing...

The island is just so peaceful, you really feel away from everyday worries. Roberto, the divemaster, was possibly the best one I have met, I got many useful tips to improve my diving. Dinners were just amazing, we loved the food. Of course, it was Italian style, almost two hours to get through the different courses, but so enjoyable. One of the few places I have visited that I definitely would like to return to."
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","Marshcroft","Near London","Fantastic for divers","We stayed 4 nights at this resort based on the outstanding Trip Advisor reviews. The resort didn't disappoint. Lovely setting, great beach and some of the diving and snorkeling is as good as anywhere in the world. The resort deserves 5 stars without doubt. However, anyone planning a visit should take into account that diving is the main activity and there is not a huge amount to do for non divers, other than snorkel, which is (excellent). My wife doesn't dive and 4 nights was enough for her. When the dive boats are out, the resort feels empty. Divers should be aware that one of the reasons the diving is so good is that here the Pacific and Indian oceans meet. Brings lots of fish but also at times difficult diving condition which require experience and skill. Having said that the dives are professionally run to the highest standards. The food is a combination of Italian with some 'westernised' Indonesian dishes at lunch. It was good food but not great and there are no alternatives available. While under Italian management, most staff are local from the nearby Flores island. Without exception they are friendly, courteous and clearly enjoy working at the resort."
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","Gordonnomad","Ottawa, Canada","best snorkelling resort in the world (so far)","I was her 5 nights June 2014 and believe this is the best snorkelling resort in the world (so far) I have been to.From years of snorkelling in many places around the world I think I have now concluded Indonesia (have done Bunaken Island and Komodo National Park Diving Resort so far), the Maldives and the Australian Great Barrier Reef on a livaboard are the best bets, although I still need to try Fiji and maybe Bonaire fits here too . But so many other well recommended places have been comparative disappointments I think I need to focus on these for the next while. So what made Komodo the best?-- great house reef--the diving trips you can tag along with do not treat you as a second class passenger as is usually the case. In fact snorkelers got their own guide and as there was usually only me snorkelling a private one at that. Sam was incredible at spotting mantas, turtles and everything else way before I did and also at locating lobsters, stone fish, lion fish and others and helping me dive down to them. He will soon move on to be a dive instructor but i am sure they will get a good replacement. If they have enough snorkelers the even do special snorkelling trips, but that was never the case while I was there as there were mainly divers.-- the coral in the area , both hard and soft, is the best I have seen-- the fish life was like an aquarium, and there were lots of mantas (even though we were outside the season), turtles and other large fish-- although i saw no sharks-- the semiarid topography and the nearby islands made for one of the more interesting locations I have snorkeled at. There were free kayaks to go to a nearby island. And there were several easy hikes on the island.-- the nearby Komodo dragons were worth a side trip with good snorkelling stops on the way back-- the 2 hour boat trip from Labuan Bajo (Flores) was great watching islands go by while lazing on the deck roof--the management was top notch, friendly and helpful, as were the serving staff in the restaurant. A special note of appreciation to the manager Elena and owner Stephan. All the details re booking, transfers etc were painless and i was able to pay at the resort with a credit card .-- the Italian meals were great, and the wine affordable given the taxes Indonesia imposes as a Muslim country.-- the huts were all you needed. Get the AC, although after several days you will not need it as you get acclimatized.I do not know how the resort could be better and will certainly return.One tip re flying from North America (Ottawa for me) is to break up the trip. I did that on the way stopping in Hong Kong / Macau, Boracay Phillipeans, Singapore, and Bali. On the way back I went straight back with an arrive late / leave early in Singapore and long airport waits and flights. Even though I got upgraded to business from Hong Kong to Ottawa the return trip just about destroyed me. So break the trip up and enjoy the going, being there and return parts of the trip."
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","Ed K","Rainier, Washington","Outstanding level of service in a remote location","Just returned from a ten day stay at Komodo Resort, celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary. It's a friendly place with access to great diving and sight-seeing. Though there are only 16 bungalows on Sebayur Island, there are over 60 staff working hard to keep the resort beautiful and your stay memorable. Considering there is no fresh water on the island, what they have accomplished is incredible. The only regret I can think of is that I waited so long in our stay to snorkel the house reef and walk around the whole island, a six mile jaunt. Those two activities gave me a much better perspective, but earlier in the week I was too busy relaxing or taking day trips to visit the flying foxes, water buffalo, dragons, timor deer and other sights on neighboring islands. Mornings, of course, were for dives out in the blue, blue lee sides of islands and small rocks jutting out of the current-ridden channels. Though somehow I only managed to fit in 12 dives, 3 of them were on the exquisite world class site, Batu Bolong, with its remarkable populations of both small and large fish . . . and outstanding hard and soft corals . . . and invertebrate populations. Even my absolute favorite nudibranch, the blue dragon, can be found there. 1 also dove Manta Point where I watched 18 mantas of various sizes swirl around me. My wife, snorkeling above, counted 30, 2 of them larger than any I saw. The other dive sites were pretty average for Indonesian destinations . . . and that's a pretty high average! Travelers like myself who enjoyed Indonesian destinations like Lembeh Resort and Wakatobi will probably like it here. If anything, Komodo Resort is a bit cozier, friendlier and laid back than those resorts. The food is just as good."

(BTW I usually hate all inclusive resorts) It is a 1.5 hour boat ride from the port at Labuan Bajo. The boat ride is included in the cost. They have an office on the main street in Labuan Bajo. It is only one of two places to stay within the limits of the Komodo National Park.A 1st class place with a laid back vibe. The Italian owners and both the local and foreign staff are friendly and fun with a true desire to make your stay great. Each bungalow has comfortable beach chairs and a big porch. The rooms are clean, spacious with AC and a big western bathroom. Internet is free for 1 hour a day or you can pay 10 Euros for a full day. It wasn’t a bad thing, it kept me present during my time on this beautiful island. The food is too good and they serve way too much (3 course dinner plus dessert) it’s the Italian way. Try a Lexi a drink made with the local alcohol that tastes like a mojito. (Alcohol and soft drinks are extra) The house reef is stunning so make sure you spend some time checking it out! The dive shop has a wonderful DM, please tell Fredrica I said hello. The dive sites are much closer than going from the mainland and they are magnificent.One of my all time favorite places to stay and to dive!

The location is simply fantastic, it's an ideal place for relaxing and for enriching oneself with the beauty of the view. Every evening we had amazing sunsets that we could admire from the beach, from the hill top, or while canoeing. The reef is spectacular, such a rich variety of coral and fish that you almost don't need to go anywhere else for snorkeling. Talking about that, I'm not a diver, I can hardly swim, yet I had plenty of things to do in five days: snorkeling was superb (either at the resort or in other locations reached by boat, where for example we had also the chance to observe a lot of mantas!); we did a ""discovery scuba dive"" with an excellent instructor who made us feel very safe, and it was a wonderful experience; we went to see Komodo dragons in Rinca, and then flying foxes (highly recommended!); finally, we borrowed a kayak, we did some hiking, and of course we also just relaxed. The whole staff is very professional and friendly. Food is very good (both the Indonesian lunch and the Italian dinner - we particularly appreciated the homemade pasta and desserts). The bungalows are beautiful and comfortable, AC in the room, and free wifi in the dining/lounge area. In conclusion, the whole experience was superb and we fully recommend it, especially for young couples or groups of friends."

"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","Terreready","New York City, New York","Understated Luxury, Gorgeous Diving","Komodo Resort does a wonderful job of exposing the charm and aesthetic of Indonesia while accenting it with an Italian warmth. It feels luxurious but not decadent. In traveling through the Philippines and then Indonesia, I have found that too often hotels cater to what they anticipate foreigners will like rather than what the indigenous spot has to offer. Komodo fuses Indonesian flair with an Italian sensibility. It feels like you are staying with a mixed extended family.For the divers, the inclusive price of dives, room and board is very fair. In our case, we were a group of four and for 2 out of 3 days we had the spacious dive boat to ourselves. Irvi, the dive master has a wonderful demeanor and took us around to beautiful spots. The diving around the hotel is stunning. The upper deck with bean bags was an incredible way to spend the way home. If you are looking to see the dragons, stay here and take a day trip. We dove in the AM and went to Rinca in the afternoon for a 3K hike. You have to be up at the crack of dawn to attempt to spot them hiking as they are in the shade by 10AM. We had originally thought to camp on Rinca or Komodo, but SOOO happy we decided to stay here instead. For snorkelers, the reef just off the hotel is an amazing variety of corals and sea life. We spotted rays, reef sharks, turtles, octopi and cuttlefish in addition to the more common and colorful varieties. The food is Indonesian at lunch and Italian at dinner and always plentiful. Breakfast is either buffet or order and also filling. They have a small but delightful wine list (Gavi at lunch after a morning dive...what's better than that prospect?) Elena and Antonello were both incredibly welcoming and hospitable. In addition to sharing a birthday cocktail with local sopi liquor, they went above and beyond in helping us with an airline ticket snafu at the end of the stay. We also appreciate that they employ a staff of 60 Indonesians that provides a valuable salaried position and training in the hospitality field. Surely that will come in handy as this beautiful corner of the world develops further. In short, Komodo Resort is worth flying around the world to enjoy."
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","stewad-s","Raleigh, North Carolina","No really a resort","I stayed for 5 nights. When I researched this area, there weren't very many choices of hotels to choose from. They started at the highest, Komodo and jumped to a budget price of $40. I was very torn on what to do. I was traveling solo so I decided to go with the Komodo resort. Guessing it would be safer, etc. When I arrived in Flores, I didn't realize it was going to be a 1.5 hour boat ride to the actual resort. I suppose I didn't do proper research. I could have easily stayed on Flores for cheaper, saw the dragons and dived. Here are the pros and cons of my stay.Pros: Enjoyed the airport transfer and greeting at the dock of resort. Loved AC. Food was good especially considering it was imported. Loved having access to as much drinking water as I wanted w/o being charged extra for it. The bungalow is lovely and spacious. Loved the turn down service in the evening. Loved having a fridge. Gorgeous reef right outside my bungalow. The massage was very relaxing. The locals were super friendly and eager to help. Stefano saved my life!! Literally!! He knew what to do in an underwater emergency. Cons: Would have rather ate meals at my leisure instead of set timing. AC didn't completely cool all the time. In defense, it was really hot. The bungalow had a fan and AC but it was explained to me that if I put the AC on, they charged me extra for the room. Hated paying extra for internet. Hated the slow boats to see the flying foxes (furry foxes) and the dragons. If it would have went just a little faster, maybe there would have been a breeze! Also, you had to smell gasoline fumes the entire time. The resort boasted being eco friendly but let boats slam anchors down all over reef. Not sure if they can do anything about that but just saying. The beach washed up tons of trash. I saw people cleaning the beach once. There is no spa. The Italian staff were friendly but you got the feeling they were ready to go back home. I didn't appreciate dealing with my dive equipment. Most places wont let you handle the tanks, etc. I know how to do it, I just don't want to being on vacation. With that said, I should have paid more attention. 2nd day, first dive, I ran out of air 10 minutes into the dive. My tank wasn't filled properly. I'm familiar with PSI not BAR. Wished they offered more than 1 type of red/white wine by the glass. My T-shirts shrank, ALOT!"

All have sea view and a pleasant terrace. Cleaning service in the room is very good and respectful of customer habit. Food is good and abundant, Indonesian at lunch, Italian for dinner. Desserts make you sure you wont loose weight even with three dive per day in strong current. Finally the diving is superlative for the location itself and very well organised from the diving guides.

"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","Shereen S","Wailuku, Hawaii, United States","Great diving and wonderful food","My husband and I had a wonderful stay and dive trip here. Diving was fantastic. Each day we dove somewhere different and dive sites included a variety of dives from deeper dives with a lot of current to slower dives looking for small stuff. We saw lots of mantas, too. The food was amazing - buffet breakfast, Indonesian food at lunch, and multi course Italian dinner at night. Tea and snacks on the dive boat. I was glad I brought my reef hook as some of the currents really rip and there is so much soft coral everywhere you can't really find a bare rock to grab on to. To my horror I dropped an important piece of equipment over board and the staff of the dive center came to my aid with a replacement first stage so I could continue diving. We were surprised that the dive staff do not set up your gear on board the boat or change tanks in between dives -usually a standard with almost everywhere we have dove and worked (we have both worked in the dive industry as Dive Masters). The resort is owned and run by a group of Italians and they have made an arid island into a comfortable and luxurious dive resort. Our room was very clean and comfortable. They do have wifi at the resort so you can stay connected if you want. I also enjoyed snorkeling out in front of the resort - it was like a little nursery there with quite a lot of fish - from exciting and colorful individual juveniles to larger schools of fish.We also took an afternoon trip to see the Komodo dragons on Rinca Island. It was pretty cool - if you are going to go on a longer trek you will want some better shoes than the flip flops I had on. The resort picked us up at the airport, took us to the office to make our final payment, then drove us to the harbor to catch the boat to Sebayur Island."

Komodo diving is excellent - varied, exciting, and at times a little too challenging with the strange and strong currents in the area. An experienced guide you trust is imperative - with Irvi and Roberto the underwater rock climbing and changing currents seemed normal after a few dives.

This place is in a class of its own. The spacious bungalows are perfectly designed and the food is incredible, with an Indonesian lunch, and a varied 3 course Italian themed evening meal plus desserts. And I never eat desserts - you have been warned the chocolate mousse and crème caramel are awesome. The staff are great, and genuinely add to a low key but classy setup, and they all obviously have a good relationship with the management.The dive boats are powerful, well organised, and the boat crews expert in handling expensive cameras and are always ready with a gentle helping hand whenever needed. The dive guides are likewise superb with the flamboyant Roberto giving dramatic and detailed dive briefings which hold your attention - something that is very important when diving in the sometimes wild and unpredictable Komodo currents. Irvi, while more reserved, offers a background in marine conservation and tourism - always topical with scuba divers, and there is a gentle written reminder of our ""contract"" with nature in the bungalows. The snorkelling on the house reef is quite extraordinary with big bat fishes and cuttle fish under the pontoon, and sea horses can be found in just one metre of water!

It seems that the resort is planning to build luxury bungalows in secluded bay at the foot of the hill, right now that part is still unspoilt.The resort itself is to very high standard; the bungalows look really nice; however we opted for the cheaper non air-con option and we suffered for it.In the evening the sand flies are a real pest; carry plenty of repellent with you; the resort get the beach sprayed once in a while but it does not seem to be effective.Snorkeling the house reef is nice but keep an eye on currents, the place is in narrow channel and the water can flow really fast at times.The food in the evening is varied and they have an excellent chef; my problem is that my main meal is at lunch time, at that time the meals are repetitive and not so appealing, as most divers are still out.The main gathering areas are in the large dining patio, at the tables, and in front of the diving shop; the staff is mainly made up of Italians & Indonesians; I missed an area in the shade with books and seating; they have a large sitting room space on top of the kitchen but nobody frequented it; they plan to put a bar there; it is still work in progress; no library or amenities yet (diving books only in diving shop); so not so good on that level; I ended up hanging more around my bungalow; the resort is expanding (+2 bungalows being built) before more attention is paid to the general comforts in communal areas, in my opinion.Diving sites are good and with plenty of fish and corals, turtles, reef sharks; we spotted two mantas in over a week we were there.The boats are not so good; they are slow, wooden hulls, with small engines and quite a few people tend to gather in the upper sun deck, and the stability is sometimes affected: once the skipper curved so much that it seemed the boat could not straighten up itself; it was not fun!I never saw any oxygen cylinders for diving emergency in the boat.So all in all considering price I think that:location is top, but due to various issues mentioned above and the high price I would give a 3 & half star; there does not seem to be an alternative besides live-aboards."

After 1 1/2 hour of boat trip the resort appears as a surrealistic place. It is situated on Sebayur island surrounded by islands all around it. The bungalows are wonderfull. I still don't understand how they could realize this so far from everything. There is airco, a very spacious bedroom and a bathroom with hot water. There is also a very nice veranda in front of the bungalow and you have your sunbeds on the beach in front of the bungalow. We did 6 dives and the dive sites are wonderful. For lunch you have a 3 course meal and for dinner a 4 course meal. For lunch it's Indonesian food and for dinner Italian food. The resort is especially occupied by Italian tourists. I think about 60 % are Italian. The dive staff are also Italian except one dive instructor who is from Indonesia. So if you like Italian food and Italian dive staff you will feel at home here. For us 6 nights was enough. Every night Italian food is a little too much. The local staff in de restaurant is very friendly and helpful and very professional. We did also a trip to Rinca island to see the Komodo dragons. After lunch on the boat we went snorkeling and we were lucky to see 2 mantas near pink beach during snorkeling. We loved Komodo resort and you should come at least one time over here. The beauty is overwhelming."

My husband was diving and I was snorkeling it was some of the best we have seen. Lucky enough to even see a manta ray even though the season hadn't really started yet. The dive boat was comfortable with room to relax on the upper deck in bean bags.The accomodations were very nice, clean and comfortable. We didnt have the AC in our room and wish we did. I would recommend getting the bungalow with AC as it was quite hot and uncomfortable trying to sleep especially with no windows to be opened and for fear of mosquitos we didn't want to leave the sliding door open. The food provided was just fine not great, nothing special. We didnt care for the Indonesian food here and elsewhere throughout Indonesia so this is no fault of the resort. The italian dinners every night were well diverse for the three nights we were there. Always something different. The pasta was the best part and always our favorite part of the meal. The other entrees, usually fish or chicken was just OK, usually quite dry. Breakfast was minimal with pancakes, fruit and eggs."

We run our own dive shop on an isolated island and found all prices more than reasonable or quite cheap for how much it costs to get items to the resort and the hassle of getting it there. The staff were very friendly and accommodating and we loved that everyday at breakfast we could pick what would eat for lunch and dinner and what time we would like it served. A really great touch. Great snorkelling off the beach right in front of our rooms with lots of things to see, be wary of strong currents if your not a very good swimmer. The diving was some of the best I have ever experienced. We had ample Manta Rays even for the low season, I had never seen one before and even with the strong current, the Manta Dive was amazing. The guide Roberto was fantastic, waiting for other boats to finish before we jumped in to eliminate over crowding on the site. All the dive sites were amazing, with more coral, critters and colour than you could imagine. We are huge Nudibranch and macro fans and we were spoilt for choice on all the dives.The resort were very efficient with arranging our tour to Rinca Island to see the Komodo Dragons and even organised pack lunches for us on boat trips so we wouldn't miss out on our lunch. When it came for us to pay, the invoice was very clear and well presented. We were a bit difficult for them having to pay with split currencies and half in cash and half on card. This did not phase them at all and they were happy to accommodate us for this.We will definitely be heading back to Komodo Resort in the future and have recommended the resort to many travellers."

The staff sprayed the rooms every night and put the mosquito nets down. All the bungalows were waterfront and had a fantastic view, with absolutely the best sunsets every night. We stayed for 5 nights and went out diving and snorkeling every day on the very comfortable dive boat, (really enjoyed the comfy bean bags on the top deck of the dive boat). A big thank you to Willy our dive master who took us to all the good dive spots and was very knowledgeable. My husband is an experienced diver and he found the diving to be interesting and with the strong currents quite challenging at times. The dive operation he found to be well run and quite professional. Myself being a snorkeler went out on the dive boat with the divers. Most of the sites were suitable for snorkeling, but if they weren't, I would sit upstairs on the comfy bean bags and read a book and take in the breathtaking views, which was very relaxing.The food was plentiful and the local staff were always there to make sure you were enjoying your stay.Would agree with the previous review about the payment system, (wasn't very satisfactory at all.)If you love diving and snorkeling then we would recommend this resort for your shore based Komodo diving destination.

"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","Naturaldog","New Haven, Connecticut","Not a 5-star resort, but definitely a 5-star+ vacation experience","My wife and I spent a week at Komodo Resort in March, bungalow number 5 with A/C (A/C costs extra, but we HIGHLY recommend it). We did three dives a day for the first five days and then combined diving and Komodo Dragon viewing (very worthwhile) on the last day. Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable, unforgettable week.Pros:1) Best shore-based diving we have ever done (using the hotel's dive boats -- the only option available), despite so-so underwater visibility due to heavy rains the previous week. Blizzards of large and small fish, beautiful hard and soft coral, and dramatic drift diving (Beware: this is not a destination for beginner divers. There are dozens of small islands here and 5+ feet of daily tidal surge, creating flukey and very strong currents in the channels among the islands.) 2) First-rate boat crew and dive-masters. Second to none, in our experience.3) The view from the 14 bungalows -- all 14 are ocean-front -- is breathtaking, especially at sunset, and especially from the bungalows situated north of the restaurant area. We have never seen a more gorgeous seascape from a hotel window (see photo).4) Large, well designed rooms with big, en suite bathrooms. Not luxurous, but roomy, comfortable and private.5) Friendly, helpful staff. Professional on-site management.6) Did I mention the view at sunset was sensational? Absolutely mesmerizing.Cons:1) Customer service during pre-stay booking was sluggish and clunky, and hotel policies are inconvenient and onerous for prospective guests. It sometimes took a day or two to get a response to an email inquiry. Once we decided to book (this took several days to nail down due to the lag time between emails), they wouldn't allow us to pay the necessary deposit with a credit card. They asked for an ""international bank transfer"" of the funds, and in Euros, not dollars. Who wants to navigate this type of transaction when booking a hotel? Not me. Later they offered to take the deposit through Pay-Pal, but they charged an extra fee for this -- something like 20-25 Euro. Also, Pay-pal is awkward if you're not used to using it, and we found that there are potential pitfalls and hidden fees (eg: unfair exchange rates) associated with international transactions on Pay-Pal -- buyer beware. Once we got to Flores -- the port town located 90 minutes from the resort by boat -- management required us to pay our stay in advance at an office downtown before we boarded the boat for the island. After paying this bill (we were allowed to use a credit card at this point) we waited more than an hour and a half in the sweltering office for the boat transfer to the resort. All of this could have been avoided if they agreed to take a credit card payment online, or even over the phone. Travelers want real-time communication with rerservations staff, and they want the convenience -- and the consumer protection -- associated with online credit-card payments. Komodo Resort falls short in both of these crucial areas. Also, travelers shouldn't have to pay a extra transaction fee to a hotel just to be able to put down a deposit. If a hotel insists on a pre-paid deposit, and it refuses to take a credit card online and prefers a different form of payment for its own convenience (Pay-Pal, in this case), then it should pay any associated fees and not put them on the guest. 2) The restaurant was only average, and not up to the standard we expected considering the price we paid. We heard through the grapevine that they were ""between chefs"", and (if true) this may have been part of the reason, but food was mostly bland, with little seasoning. Lunch provided on the dive boat was very basic as well.3) This is NOT a resort for non-divers. There is nothing to do except dive during the day and enjoy the fabulous setting at sunrise and sunset. We are divers, so this was just fine for us, but if you don't dive then I wouldn't recommend staying here.Bottom line: Guest-hostile booking policies and mediocre food are more than offset by the brilliant diving and the world-class beach-front location. A magical week, thoroughly enchanting. If you're a diver and you want to dive the Komodo Islands from a shore-based accommodation, this is the only place to stay."

Having travelled to the area once before on a liveaboard we knew what to expect with the diving.It didn't disappoint. From an hour with many manta to 30 mins with one 5m oceanic right through to finding a blue ringed octopus on a site never seen before, and everything in between.Of course diving in the wet season meant just that, we often got just as wet above land and in the boat but the boat crews, and dive crew did everything they could to please us and every other guest. We really couldn't have asked for more. In fact we're sure they brought in a local guide just for us at their expense (we're painfully slow divers).The food was excellent as were the staff in the restaurant. Indonesian for lunch, Italian for dinner and anything and both for breakfast. Considering you're in the middle of nowhere it's quite remarkable.Accommodation too was better than expected. I do recommend paying the little bit extra for aircon, it's not perfect but on days where it feels like 40o out there it's worth it. Helps with the mozz at night too. One last thing. You must find the time to walk up to the top of the Island, it's breathtaking, photos will never do it justice.All in all a pretty amazing trip, Stephano the owner is intent on ensuring every guest has the best, Roberto the current instructor is superb and has a trillion stories to tell, Anke was our divemaster, currently freelance but Stephano would be mad not to snap him up.We don't often re-visit the same place but this might be worth a second go in the dry season, better start planning now. :-)"
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","singingtiffany","Singapore","The diving and food are very good, but a bit pricey","We stayed 2 nights there for our honeymoon. The diver instructors were awesome, they know when the Manta and where they will come, so they will just guide you to a spot for you to wait rather than chase after mantas. We did 2 dives and saw 1 on the 1st dive and at least 7-8 on the 2nd dive.The food is gorgeous! Especially their italian cuisine. Also snoorkling just around the beach you can already see so much soft corals that you don't see normally elsewhere. We found it a little pricey though but guess it's on a private island, everything is needed to brought in. Plus diving, we spend over a thousand US dollars for diving, rinca island trip plus accomodation and full board over a short stay of 2 days. The only downside of the whole experience is during the bookings. We called up the hotel and quoted the offer from Tripadvisor, and was told that no room is not available. But agoda shows it is available, so we booked it there. Then when we asked the tripadvisor discount again and was told that it won't apply since we booked it through agoda. We tried to convince them and we were told the last night was not available and we will be given 50 euro refund and they will book us a room on the main island for that night or we stay at the director's room. We accepted the director's room and 50 euro discount. A few days later, we were told 2 customers cancelled their booking and now they have the full availability for the 3 nights.It's just a little confusing this back and forth, if we could have been given the room in the first place when we called, at least the owner of the resort can save their commission paid to agoda, and we can also save some through the tripadvisor promotion. Also when you book through agoda, it's not very clear so we didn't know that standard (rather than deluxe) doesn't come with air conditioning and we need to pay 25 euro extra a night for it. Also booking through agoda, we can't enjoy the diver package which is more economical than buying diving trips alone. So in total, we paid at least another 100-200 euros more.It worked out alright in the end, the manager Stefano arranged us to see Komodo dragons and 2 dives in one day as we only have 1 full day there due to missing a flight. But the experience could be so much better if the management of the resort can take a little responsibility with messing up the booking issue and more flexible in how it is being handled."

We had a five night stay, and saw a huge variety of underwater life, from mantas down to tiny, rare nudibranch). The guides were top notch- concerned, knowledgeable and friendly - and every dive of the ten we did was very different. Having dived a fair number of 'world class' sites, this was for me the best diving experience I have had and all within an hour's boat ride from the resort.We weren't crazy about the food, especially the dinners, which we found a little bland - perhaps a compromise to the family groups staying - and would have preferred Indonesian to Italian, but we certainly never went hungry. And do pay the extra for the A/C, as there are a lot of insects at night in the rainy season and the mosquito net on the bed is essential.The staff in the resort and the boat crews are brilliant, with good spoken English, and every small request was fulfilled right away with a smile.

We were not disappointed!!!Our favourite parts of our 3 week honeymoon all across Indonesia all occurred here. Mine was when we first stepped off the resorts free transportation boat from Labuan Bajo. Firstly, I am not a fan of boat trips but their boat was the best I've ever experienced just because they have BEANBAG CHAIRS! it was so comfy to sit on the roof under the shades and nap on the way through the calm archipelago waters. Upon arrival we were given fresh cold towels on the pier to freshen up with before we were escorted to the restaurant - we thought we were awaiting our room keys etc but within minutes we were presented with a three course lunch the quality of which is indescribable. we didn't expect much for the food considering how remote the place is but it was excellent every time. every dinner was 5 courses including breads to start with, an appetiser, a main course, a pasta dish and then a pudding! Italian or local cuisine (try it all, it's all fantastic!). For my husband, the dives were the highlight of our trip. The family of owners are all experienced divers and snorkellers and know all the best spots. We took there package for half a days diving which included three spots, during which we saw sting rays, 5 huge manta rays, several giant turtles, sharks and all manner of fish and corals.The rooms were great and bathrooms finished perfectly. we did unfortunately get eaten alive by mosquitoes so be sure to tuck in the provided nets more tightly than we did! The island views are outstanding; yes its true as other reviewers state that the beaches are more coral than sand but this is to be expected of the majority of Indonesian beaches. The local staff are wonderful, speaking perfect English and also Italian, they were very friendly and charming. we also took the resorts trips to Kalong island to watch the bats fly their roost at sunset and the trip to Rinca island to see the dragons - both excellent.

The two italian owners are on the island themselves most of the time to make sure you have a once in a lifetime holiday.The divesites of komodo national park are as close as it gets. The diving is among the best I have ever done in my life. There is small stuff, big stuff, and the most beautiful coral that I have seen so far. There are strong and unpredictable currents but the dive-masters and the italian instructor laura take fantastic care of everyone. I can only highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to get away from it all, do diving in one of the best dive spots in the world, and enjoy a little bit of luxury in a friendly family atmosphere. pure barefoot luxury!"
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","PaulGCalifornia","California","Komodo Resort and Diving Club","Just finished a 5 nite stay in this paradise. Best diving ever in 40 years. Best Italian food I have ever tasted and lots of it. Great Indonesian food too. We made friends with the ""United Nations"" guests and Italian and local staff rapidly. It just seemed like everyone was enjoying good karma. English is the common 2nd or 3rd language so everyone shares their adventures with each other. Really cool place on many levels. Great little snorkeling reef right in front of lodge. Outstanding local Dive Masters who balance safety with excitement. Be conservative here as the currents are often very strong and unusual - that's why the life is so vibrant but it complicates things too. Don't overestimate your abilities until you get a gradual exposure to the currents. Diving is European style so bring metric gauges and bone up on your hand signs and current techniques. (my lessons learned). The resort's gear looked brand new but I brought mine which they organized and cleaned everyday. Our main guide was Willy who just kept us cracked up as he SAFELY guided us through some amazing diving - just a cool guy. I would recommend Dive Masters Willy and Laura highly for new divers to Komodo. Saw all the fantastic things you go to Komodo for - very vibrant and diverse life on these reefs. Mantas by the dozens were literally everywhere on one dive. On other dives you saw sharks, turtles, amazing schools of fish, pristine healthy hard and soft corals, big and small stuff. We took the Komodo dragon trip to Rinca and the flying fox viewing boat trip - good non-diving activities. The weather was 100% fine every day (this is a very dry part of Indonesia) and seas were calm except obviously strong currents. The resort is new, remote and probably there are some glitches in long distance communications/international understanding but the staff is always around. ( I also found them to be very helpful and honest - one example - my wife lost her i phone/camera which they promptly found and returned to us as our flight prepared to leave !!!! ) I would recommend you spend some time and exchange several e-mails to clarify any concerns before going. I made an error in matching flight times from and to La Buan Bajo airport (disorganized and poorly secured airport IMHO) with the resort's free boat shuttle. I also wish I had planned on staying longer because Komodo Resort and Diving Club was a really wonderful addition to an already wonderful Bali trip.Glitches: The domestic airlines make it hard for international travelers to arrange flights to LaBuan Bajo from Bali or other parts of Indonesia via the internet. I had to do this by hand upon arrival in Bali so there was uncertainty until that point whether i could even get to Komodo ! Like all Indonesia there are bugs ( beds are netted) - bring DEET spray - and the sun can be intense. My wife and I carried extra water everywhere. Near Rinca some of the reefs at a snorkeling spot are damaged by years of anchoring - such places need tie up buoys. Litter near the town is disappointing, like other parts of Indonesia. Tobacco use is where USA was 40 years ago. Nonetheless..just go..it was wonderful.Paul G. California USA"
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","Astri S","Warsaw, Poland","Speechless!","My husband and I spent 6 days of our honeymoon in this beautiful place in September, and we are SO happy we did. Where do I start? From the moment we stepped on the Island and throughout our stay, we were received by a bunch of warm, gentle, funny and great staff. From the kitchen staff to the knowledgeable dive masters and boat crew, they are all really lovely people who make the experience very enjoyable. The owners are a couple of open, sympathetic and chilled our Italians who really do everything to make your stay a nice one. They are flexible and accommodating to the needs of their guests, and just good fun to hang out with. The bungalows are all simple yet stylish, the food is amazing and the diving is world class. The currents are strong, but as a relatively inexperienced diver (20 dives) I was able to enjoy the experience and feel safe thanks to great dive masters who know the area very well. We would recommend guests to stay at least a whole week in order to fully enjoy the Komodo national park, and because of the travel time. From our point of view, 10 days would have been perfect. We know now for next time. This place is perfect for open and laid back people who would like to discover the natural beauty of the Komodo islands first hand and relax. We had a fantastic time and will be back for sure!"
"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","rgodec","España","Great hotel but MEAN management","We stayed here for 4 days last August.The hotel itself is really great (clean, confortable, beautiful...) offering excelent food (Indonesian for lunch, Italian for dinner) and great diving excursions and the island just like paradise. However the management philosophy makes you not feel so good.First of all be aware that, although you pay a high price (200 euros per night), every service/compliment is excluded and you have to pay an extra: 5 euros/day for snorkeling equipment, 3 euros/hour for kayak renting, 3 euros/hour for internet access, drinks on diving boat are not free either... In my opinion, this is a low-cost business philosofy but paying luxury prices which makes you feel robbed when you get the final invoice (expect surprises!!!).Moreover, the management staff is inflexible with the hotel rules. We asked to check out at 1pm (just 1 hour later!!) because our boat (for which the hotel charged us 1 million rupies for 4 people, more than twice the normal price!!) would pick us up at 1:30pm. Not only the answer was a big NO but they asked us to leave the room even earlier than 12:00 because other guests were coming!! Shouldn't the new guests wait if arriving early?? Just the question was annoying...We didn't like either seeing the owner yelling at the staff all the time.Regarding the beach, it is not very sandy but full of rocks and corals and with strong currents which makes it not very confortable for swimming. If you want to enjoy a good beach go to Bidadari instead, but Komodo Resort is much better for diving.The best: the beauty of the area, the food are the diving excursiones with very good master divers knowing all the good places in the area.Summarizing, the hotel is really good and if you don't care about money and you are willing to strictly respect their rules it is totally recommended. Otherwise I think there are other places to give a chance."

We have just returned from a 12 night visit here and had a fantastic time. As has been said before the bungalows are of a great standard the mosquito nets could be a bit longer to stay tucked in as we did get bit a fair few times but thats my only gripe and I'm being fussy. The diving is world class but with strong currents at some sites they are best suited to experienced divers. The dive guides are great Willie is so knowledgeable, great at finding the unusual critters and a great guy, Al is a very kind man and great with the guests, Rama is fun and entusiastic but Laura could learn to smile a bit more and be a bit more welcoming and remember that people have spent a lot to be here. What really makes this place so SPECIAL though for me are the local staff who are so charming, gentle and courteous. A big thank you to all of them but particularly Alex ( Lexi) and 'Chef' for coping with our special meal requests!"

The bungalows are very nice, the food is out of this world, especially with being on a remote island... The owners really seem to care that the guests are enjoying themselves.

"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","octopusmessiah","London","Paradise, peace and proximity","Bit of a journey getting to Labuan Bajo, then an unfortunate hiccup with the airport transfer—no one there to greet us at the plane, our only real complaint —but once we were checked in and sitting on board the hour-long boat to Sebayur, reclined in giant bean-bags, watching the amazing sunset, we got the feeling that everything was going to be just fine… and it was…This is a stunning desert island resort located just outside the boundary of Komodo National Park. I don’t really want to know how they got permission to build so close but as long as they continue to keep the waste under control, as a happy customer, I’m glad they did. The logistical advantage to staying here is waking up an hour closer to the fabulous dive sites and dragons, instead of having to “commute” from Labuan Bajo. Also, since neither my wife nor myself are divers and I tend toward crippling sea-sickness, this was a much better option for us than joining one of the many live-aboards plying the region.The cabins are simple, clean, functional, stylish A-frame huts with picture windows overlooking a private white-sand beach and a small deserted island a couple hundred yards off shore. The rooms have large beds, ample mosquito nets, wet-room-style bathrooms, Western toilets (which you’re asked to flush with provided salt water when possible), small desk, convenient and fairly-priced mini-bar fridge, fans— and air-con on the deluxe cabins, where we stayed. Think we could have done fine without the air-con given it was breezy but it was nice to occasionally cool the room down before bed. Each room also has a porch with more of those comfy bean-bags—a great place to unwind, grab some shade or enjoy the night sky so far from civilization. (here my wife insists I mention the fabulous, anomalous, stylish, swiveling, Italian leather desk chair which was as surprising to find as it was superb)This is a truly remote resort—even the water has to be boated in and pumped into storage tanks so conservation principles are a must. Still, we never wanted for showers or drinking water and it was easy enough to rinse our gear. The food is tasty and filling with generally Indonesian fare for lunch and a three course slap-up Italian feast for dinner. Given the location, it was amusing and impressive to see how seriously the Italian owners take their food: I mean, fish tartare for starters, a course of homemade pasta, some local fish or tender chicken with garden vegetables then a choice of fresh fruit, crème brulee or panna cotta for dessert? Nice. Each lunchtime, the lovely, efficient and on-the-case restaurant manager Helen would present you with two choices for each course for dinner. It might be a bit hard to go completely vegetarian but the chefs seemed eager to please. Breakfast was a generally bland but filling affair though the Flores coffee was strong as oak, thick as mud, and very much appreciated. The only real downside to our mealtime was a certain large, rude, loud and demanding American family group— though I’m grateful to the dive staff for always putting these people on a separate boat— they really do aim to please…As a borderline obsessional snorkeller (check the bio, if interested) I can rate the “house reef” here as: pretty darn good. There’s also the bonus availability and reefs of the uninhabited island offshore where the staff are happy to drop you by speedboat (thirty second ride) with a book, a towel, some water and your snorkel gear—just wave your fins above your head and they come back and get you, easy. (Sidenote: this island also appeared to be where the No Roads kayak “expeditions” stop for camping and I gotta say-- personally, I’d be extremely disappointed after kayaking all day at huge expense to look up from my tent and see the smart, well-appointed chalets of Komodo Resort and Diving Club glittering across the narrow channel. I mean, what if you smell the fresh foccacia?)In the water: lots of healthy corals teeming with colorful reef fish though the big stuff is mostly to be found further afield. To that end, accompanying the dive boats around the national park was top rate and we had some absolutely epic snorkels in many varied topographies. Rays, copious turtles, sharks, giant cuttlefish, incredible coral formations, more angelfish species than I’ve ever seen in one place— not to mention the reasonably priced (35 euros pp) all-day trip to see the dragons on nearby Rinca, including lunch and two snorkels. The dive boat staff were very professional and kept a close eye on both divers and snorkellers—no small feat given the wind-chop, ferocious currents and even the occasional whirlpool. I can’t say enough about the shaded rooftop bean-bag lounge scene on top of all the boats, or the rocket-fuel coffee provided. The only minor let down was the excursion to see the flying foxes—an hour and a half each way to see (okay, there were thousands) of blurry brown blobs winging through the fading twilight.All told we spent an idyllic week here, very laid back and quite a bit of fun. The prices are fair, the food is great and the staff were wonderful. Guests while we were there were a mix of Italians, Indonesians, Brits, Americans and, aside from the aforementioned families who made me ashamed of my species, very quiet and welcoming.Final bits and bobs: there is some construction of new chalets going on but it isn't noisy or seem excessive; unless you bring cash, bills need to be paid at the office in Labuan Bajo at the end of your stay. The island had patchy mobile reception, though we never tried to use the wifi. Questions put to the website were answered promptly and informatively, just loved hanging out here really, quite bit sad to leave. Would love to return. Recommended."

The cottages are actually better than they appear in the photos, the food is to die for and the diving extra special. We went with Laura to Batu Bulong and Manta Point for two extraordinary dives, followed by a memorable night dive just around the corner at the Mini Wall. They also take care to offer you wonderful opportunities to see the Komodos and the flying foxes, as well as helping us organise our internal flights, meeting us at the airport and getting us back to the plane at the end. We found the staff extremely attentive, friendly and hospitable. Gaye had not warned them she is a vegetarian and yet within an hour of our arrival the chef had whipped up a wonderful lunch for her, and all her subsequent meals were imaginative, tasty and fresh. The four course meals were something else! Don't miss the house reef, right at your front door, either. A few steps and you can snorkel some very healthy coral which is full of life - we saw turtles every day. Highly recommended and filling up fast!"

Stunning location and amazing hospitality!","So this is the first time i've left a review on here, but after spending four days in paradise i thought it was about time i wrote one!!Me and my girlfriend stumbled across this place back in May whilst in Komodo and Flores. We initially booked a two night stay, but after arriving at the resort we decided to re-arrange our plans and stay an extra two nights....... if we had more time, we would have stayed much longer! The island itself is beautiful and in an ideal location for diving and Komodo trips! We don't dive ourselves but we did spend two days snorkeling whilst others dived. The boat and crew were fantastic and the snorkeling was by far the best we've ever done..... we were extremely jealous of the divers and have now decided it's time to get certified! The accommodation was very nice and just as it is in the pictures! The restaurant was also very nice and the food is definitely some of the best we've had since been in Indonesia, and we've been here for over a year! Everything is made fresh and it is a combination of Italian and Indonesian cuisine with plenty of fresh fish. The food is another real selling point of this place!The staff at this place are also amazing. Indonesia can often be a frustrating place to be but the service here was brilliant and very refreshing! The staff were very friendly and helpful and the owners were incredibly hospitable! They looked after us from the moment we were picked up and also helped us to arrange onward flights and provided us with a wealth of knowledge about the area. BY FAR the best hospitality we've received in Indonesia if not anywhere!I really can not recommend this place enough, a stunning location and FANTASTIC value for money! We will definitely be returning!!"

It's one of the most beautiful places I've ever been. The staffs (Stefano, Laura, Flavia, Willy & Alim) are nice and friendly even though some of them could use some more training. I appreciate their efforts to maintain the ocean by cleaning up the beach from plastic waste in the afternoon, when the water is low. I also took my PADI diving certificate here. It was a private course with Laura. The ""pool"" training part of the course was conducted on a shallow pristine water with school of fishes around me. With Laura's extra patience, I was able to face my fear of deep water. Thank you, everyone!"

"Labuan Bajo","Komodo Resort & Diving Club","0","JP T","Jakarta, Indonesia","Paradise found!","Surely one of the better dive and beach resorts we ever visited in Indonesia. Imagine this: take one of the most beautifull marine parks in Indonesia, with hundreds of uninhabited islands, mix in some of the best dive sites and snorkling in Indonesia. Then build a 4 star resort on the fringe of that marine park, add an Italian chef, a great dive instructor and a heap of friendly local staff...that's paradise right there. We traveled with 3 small kids and although the resort does not specifically cater to kids, they had a great time on the beach and snorkling. The boat trip from Labuan Bajo takes about 1 hr and from the resort you can organize day trips to see the Komodo Dragons. We went to Rinca island for that and it was a great experience. Did I mention the rooms are great and that they have 24h electricity and hot running water (which still is a luxury in this part of Indonesia). The owner plans to increase room prices significantly from May, when the resort will be finished (they are still adding a few bungalows), and aims for the European market for scuba holidays. It still will be a great place for independent travelers and if you manage to get there before May, its great value too!"

We went to Komodo for the dragons and some diving and left with a longing to go back. A lot of it was because of the hospitality and care we received here. The resort is brand new on an uninhabited island right outside Komodo National Park. Lot of great dive sites are only within an hour whereas they'd take twice as long to come to and from Labuanbajo. Dive equipment is also all new, the resort is PADI-affiliated, bungalows are all sea-facing and airy, good food (homemade pasta, jams, fresh vegetables, etc.) and service! Stefano, who built the place from nothing, knows the area and Indonesia very well and took a lot of care to ensure our safety during dives. We had time for only two dives and the Manta point is simply superb. The corals too are healthy and lovely to see. The dragons are a day trip and the snorkeling is also very good, we were told. We initially wondered if we'd get bored with nothing else to do on the island but you are pretty tired by the end of the day and after a wonderful meal, you are pretty much ready to crash. And the quiet was great to truly unwind and relax. Would highly recommend!"

After a full day Komodo dragon trek I decided to skip out on dinner and breakfast next day because it was not worth ruining my taste buds. The room itself was clean and large. Water supply was good.

Then we were shown to our villa. It was a regular hotel room without even a balcony. They don't have villas at all even though our booking clearly stated that we would be in a villa - and the price we paid was well beyond a regular hotel room. There was one chair in the room. The pool was filthy and completely unusable. On our last day there, it was looking a bit better. The pool has about 8 lounge chairs and 6 well worn beach towels. The chairs do not have cushions. The beach is unusable except for walking. The beer is outrageously overpriced - double what we paid in nice restaurants. We only ate breakfast there since it was included. The menu is really overpriced. The wifi never worked in the restaurant/lounge and only worked in one section of the lobby. We were supposed to stay for 4 nights, but left after 2 when we managed to find a better place. A huge disappointment that only became bearable when we knew we were leaving."
"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","lex_loci_david","Melbourne","Not the best","So this is mediocre to mediocre/poor tourist hotel that although only a few years old is starting to show signs of wear and tear.Located 5 minutes out of the busy (and noisy) little port of Labuan Bajo there is nothing else around. No shops, no restaurants - nothing at all.We preferred staying out of the port - where the hostels and hotels looked pretty grim and we did not regret that choice. The hotel has a shuttle that is free from 7am to 8pm for going into the port and coming back. It is available at a cost at other times.The real issue here is the unusual design of the building(s). The main building is furthest from the water with two 'villas' next and then a open air gazebo type structure nearest the beach and the pool. If you dont stay in the 'villas' then you will not have any view at all. If it rains then you will get soaked getting from your room (whether a 'Villa' or not) to the 'restaurant.'I use the term restaurant loosely. It serves really really bad food - by any standard. They take forever to cook it. For instance, chicken wings took 90 minutes to come out. They then take forever to give you the bill. We spent 35 minutes waiting for a bill!The hotel is on a beach but if you are thinking sparkling clear blue water then guess again. While not actually that bad it wasnt the sort of beach you would recommend to someone.We liked:- the room. It was ok for size without being large.- the room was clean- pillows and bed were great- the shower had 'real' hot water- the location with its own beach.- staff were quite friendly.We found this to be not so good- the food. Really terrible - and guess what - a service charge of 21% on what is already overpriced food. I noticed that no local tourists ate at the hotel restaurant. They obviously knew better.- Wifi. At best you could say serviceable. Other times you get nothing.- tv is very old and small- the bathroom smells. Like all the time.- the price. I would say it was 25% overpriced for what it offered.- the staff were clueless as to local attractions."

Our travel agent in Flores changed our hotel one week before our arrival in Flores so we ended up coming here. There two types of rooms: rooms that have sea view( nothing really exciting) and room in the main building that don't have balconies and have view the rooms that actually have a sea view. Breakfast was minimal and there were flies all over the place. The hotel staff somewhat indifferent. The only positive thing about this hotel was the clean room. Would I go back there? NO!"
"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","Zessi F","","Nice & comfy","Totally worth of stay after a whole week on a road trip. It's clean. If you had spare of money, get the villa to get the sea view. Otherwise choose the deluxe and request for the middle to get the view as well. Mine was 206, and got good view.Hang out at its restaurant during the sunset. It's gorgeous.The beach is clean but the water is not clear, so not too tempting to swim in.Good value for sure."

"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","outback_oasis","Central Australia","Modern comfortable rooms in an average (but potentially great) setting","We stayed here on two single night occasions during our holiday in Flores.It was comfortable and modern, but we felt the place lacked soul.The design of the buildings has not maximised the space available, and most rooms do not have uninterrupted sea views, as you would hope in this region. Just doesn't seem to be well thought out.The gardens were nice and tidy and enjoyable, with good birds visiting.We enjoyed the pool and the restaurant area. Staff were very attentive and meals nicely served. Breakfast was included and generous.The beach area needs some work, and certainly is not a swimming beach, as it is dirty and shallow. Quite good for shore bird watching however.Like many areas in Flores there is a bad rubbish problem and it seems that from the Hotels point of view it is not their problem. But it is your problem! So don't leave it to guests like us to pick up the beach rubbish, which we always do when we can.Walking along the beach reveals a mixed bag of other hotels and restaurants, most looking after their own little space. Development has been a bit haphazard and hopefully this improves over the next few years."

"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","ARWhite","Allentown, Pennsylvania","Very pleasant and relaxing","I spent one night in a villa at the Luwansa Beach Resort as part of a visit to Komodo National Park. I did not book the hotel directly--it was part of a package that included transportation and a guide for visiting the park.Check-in was simple and quick. The lobby, which is the only part of the hotel with wifi, has a comfortable seating area with tables for socializing and using the wifi (which is very slow and useful for checking email and confirming travel arrangements, but little else).My villa was exquisite. I had a huge, comfortable king size bed and a nice size desk. The bathroom was large and well appointed, and the towels were nice and fluffy.I had dinner at the restaurant, which overlooks the beach. It's a lovely place to watch the sunset. I had an excellent meal that was expensive by local standards but still very reasonable. Service was unrushed but responsive. I also had the complimentary breakfast buffet, which was very nice and offered plenty of good options.I wish I'd planned a longer stay. This place was wonderful."

It is on the beach and fifteen minutes by car to town or airport whichever is necessary. The shuttle service could not be better. It is free and will take you where you want to go. The staff are lovely and helpful with just enough English. Nothing seems too much bother. The beach lights up at sunset. Wifi is poor and was virtually non-existent while I was there due to ""electricty down"" there is Wifi at reception. The telephone lines were down too during my visit so I was unable to phone for an airport pickup. The shower was good and hot. The bed was clean and comfortable, toiletries,safe and fridge were provided. I was given an upgrade so the room and especially the bathroom were large and roomy. There was a flatscreen TV but only a couple of English channels. The grounds of the hotel are lovely, there are hardly any sunbeds for sun worshippers, and the beach is at you doorstep."

In total we stayed 7 nights. We liked the hotel very much. Spacious and clean rooms with a/c, very friendly and helpful staff, nice breakfast buffet, nice pool. On the first night we had dinner at the hotel which was pretty expensive and unfortunately rather european spicy. As we liked the authentic indonesian spicy and hot food better we went to the fish market every night. With the free shuttle to town no problem at all. The Wifi is slow as everywhere else in Flores and only available in the Lobby but that didn't bother us as we were on vacation. Would definitely stay here again."

Nice hotel in a good location (about 2km from town) on the beach. Free shuttle service between 7am-8pm, which was very handy. Rooms are very clean, comfortable, and well-equipped. Very good quality for the price. Cons: pool maintenance is lacking, wifi only really works in the lobby, food is overpriced, and staff/management seem a bit unorganized (we had some issues/discrepancies with our bill while checking out)Overall, I would (and did) recommend to other travelers staying in the area."
"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","Lesley O","Oxted, England, United Kingdom","Great little place","This hotel appeared to be one of the nicer ones in Labuan without being expensive. You really do get value for money here. I paid £20 a night for the room and breakfast (buffet). The rooms were clean and spacious, no balconies but large windows. Wifi is only available in the foyer and it was very VERY slow. That said, the foyer did become a very social place where all the guest congregated to use the Internet. Staff service is good but SLOW. Indonesian island time at its best. So don't expect anything to happen straight away when u ask. But it will get done eventually. This hotel is situated out of the town centre. But They offer a free shuttle bus into town that stops at 8pm or u can hire a bike or get a taxi. It's all cheap.Breakfast is simple but nice. Omelette are good. The pool is lovely but it's not cleaned regularly. If u want it cleaned out all u need to do is ask.The hotel is on the beach but it's not a pleasant one. It's dirty with rubbish and plastic everywhere but u do get to see a cracking sunset! All in all its good value for money. I had a very relaxing stay here. The town itself is just a small port town but it has a cracking fish night market and find good restaurants! Good for a rest before your next stop!"

However the air conditioner works well and the TV has many channels local and international (well, at least they have National Geographic).Breakfast by the sea is pretty nice and the menu is quite excellent from fried rice, bacon, pancakes, cereals.Shuttle bus is also perfect, you just need to wait sometimes but still helps a lot to take me to the town."

Rooms are a good size with comfortable bed and pillows. The shower was great and basic bathroom accessories were supplied which is unusual for Flores. Wifi in the rooms was poor but lobby and restaurant was a bit stronger. Strangely there are no balconies which was disappointing and meant that you didn't want to stay in the room for long. The pool was a highlight, right on the beach and umbrellas if you need some shade. being a little out of town we decided to eat at the restaurant. Found the food to be quite good quality and ample choice. Breakfast was also at the restaurant beside the beach and the selection and service were both good."

But no purpose in booking a longer stay - a real ""resort"", i.e. a stand-alone hotel (with all facilities for at least a few days) should be different.Positive: friendly, patient and helpful staff. Great view from the breakfast table in the garden onto the Sea. Free airport transfer. Nice, simple and clean architecture and well-kept property. Pool clean, rather small.On the downside: 1. the beach is terribly dirty!!! Disgusting amounts of plastic bottles, cans, rotten fish... at the time of my visit. 2. no internet in the rooms (they say this will change). My room rate did not include breakfast - a bad idea, as there is no alternative outside."
"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","jiawenny","","Exceeding our expectations!","We book a night stay through agoda. It was surprisingly new and clean! It was approximately 10 mins drive from the habour to the resort. The room was well equipped with the necessary amenities that we required. One thing they could further improved was to strenthen the WiFi signal for rooms located near the end of the corridor. We had to walk down to the lobby just to gain access to decent WiFi connection.It's great they provide complimentary pick up and transfer services from 7am to 8 pm. We did pay for our transfer as our flight was early in the morning, the price was affordable it was just that the driver did not bring along any change for the bill I gave him and he wanted me to walk OUT of the airport to a nearby resort to get the change for him. I thought it would be easier for him to ask around the airport since he is a local and it would be easier for him to communicate with the airport's staff for the change. I would still recommend this resort and perhaps the resort's management could look into further enriching the staffs' service quality."

The hotel opened three years ago and during our stay they were celebrating their anniversary. We got a very warm welcome and were invited to their festivity and the hospitality was superb during our whole stay.In general you have to bear in mind that Labuan Bajo is not yet on the same level as the main tourist destinations in Indonesia (e.g. Bali) therefore you should not expect the same service or amenities as in a Sheraton or Four Seasons (so please do not complain about their service or breakfast). The staff is always doing their best to offer a great service.Positive:- large and clean rooms with good AC. The room comes with a nice sea-view, a large bathroom, a safe and a fridge.- Free shuttle service to the town from 7am to 8pm incl. free pick-up from the airport. We used this service every day to get to our dive center.- nice pool area- friendly service- good breakfast incl. egg-station, warm dishes, toast and fruitsRoom for improvement:- Free WIFI is extremely slow in the rooms but most of the time available"
"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","ssuhj","Singapore","Average hotel, but bad experience with island tour","Hi, we stayed at Luwansa from 8-12 June and had one of the most unforgettable experiences.. and not in a good way. We booked the Rinca Villa which was average at best. It looks just any other deluxe room. It did overlook the beach so sunset was a nice experience. Everything else was basic and average. The food wasn't amazing. We booked our island tour (Komodo Island, Pink Beach and Rinca Island) through the hotel manager on the first day. Not only was it overpriced, halfway thru the tour our sailboat died and we were stuck in the open sea with choppy waters for 4 hours. Our tour guide (who was also the hotel security guide) contacted the hotel manager who in turn contacted the ""military"". This ""military commander"" found us after 4 hours in a speedboat and asked that we pay IDR2 mil for the fuel for his speedboat (IDR3 mil had to be paid by the hotel side apparently). So not only did we not not finish the tour and not get a refund, we had to pay extra for something that we did not ask for. And because of this, the hotel experience left a very bitter taste in our mouths. We would go back to Flores and Labuan Bajo in a heartbeat, but definitely will not stay in this hotel again."
"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","Tiwa","Jakarta","Good location, amazing view","We were staying for two night. I got the Rinca room, which was very spacious, comfy and clean.

Staff were very friendly and the GM was very helpful. One improvement they may want to consider seriously is about the mosquitoes. However, I'll be staying there again if I come back to Labuan Bajo."

However, the shuttle is available only up to 8 in the night. Considering the bad food provided in the hotel restaurant we ate out all the nights we were there and had to either hurry up with our dinner or pay extra for the shuttle to take us back to the hotel. Breakfast at the restaurant way below average.We first had the room on the ground floor and requested to shift to the first floor so that we had a sea view rather than a garden view. The beach is right in front of the hotel so the location is good. The room is large and clean - same with the bathroom on the first floor. Ground floor bathroom was a bit gloomy. Service is poor - considering the standard of Bali hotels. We had to lug our bags between rooms ourselves, had to figure out where the ac remote was hidden/kept, had to figure out how the door to the balcony opened (it was jammed), had to figure out how the safe worked (it had a problem) etc....We ended up calling the staff over for each of these annoyances which would have been avoided if someone had brought us to our room when we checked in and given us an intro to where all things were. Something that's done at every hotel normally.Place is run down a bit. Like someone else said it before - the choices in Labuan Bajo aren't many and this did ok for a night or two."
"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","Kate M","New Delhi, India","Good, if a little rough around the edges","I struggled with what rating to give Luwansa. In another location I'd probably have gone with 3 stars, but in Labuan Bajo your options are limited and Luwansa ticks a lot of boxes. It is out of town, situated on a quiet beach. It has a lovely swimming pool. The rooms are clean and perfectly adequate for a short stay. And, above all, the staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful. On the flip side, the food is below average - this is even more a shame when you factor that the hotel is away from town so you thus have to get out to get fed, but it is also a shame because the Luwansa has a much better location than most of the restaurants in town. Furthermore, although the hotel offers a free shuttle, which at least ensures your access to town, this is not operated in a logical way, and thus you can often find yourself waiting long stretches or being delayed by other guests. Having said all of this, as said, the Luwansa will offer you a simple but satisfactory experience and with all the fantastic diving on offer in Komodo National Park, you aren't likely to be staying much at the hotel anyway!"

"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","Rob K","Perth, Australia","Good but not great","This beach resort, like so many places I have stayed which have ‘beach resort’ in their name, whilst being on a beach, is not on a particularly nice stretch of beach … it’s not on what I would call sand, but more like dirt, and it does not look appetising to swim. However, that aside, it has beautiful views of the ocean and sunsets, and a nice (although slightly small) swimming pool overlooking the ocean. The grounds are very nice and well kept, and the rooms are large and airconditioned. However, it seems the hotel (or likely the town itself) is still new to the hotel trade and learning – the staff at check-in and the pool bar weren’t particular helpful or of service, and the rooms were missing a few creature comforts, and the food wasn’t particularly great – that aside however it was a comfortable stay, and they do offer a shuttle service to the town, which is very handy given it’s quite a ways from the main strip (not walking distance)."

The staff fall over themselves to help out and are uber friendly. The rooms are a generous size with all the usual Western standards of facilities. The hot water showers are a real treat and the TV shows Fox movies for those 'can't be bothered to go into town' evenings. The hotel operate a free shuttle to and from town. It's handy if you take the phone number to call for a pick-up from LBJ. Other hotels charge lots for this so I know it's a big plus. LBJ's not somewhere you want to linger for more than a couple of days! The hotel pool is small but perfectly formed and clean. Enough sun loungers to go round plus free pool towels. Don't expect to frolic on the beach out front however; LBJ isn't famous for its clean beaches. But the viewpoint's lovely and the restaurant (just breakfasts) is right on the beach. Good food too and not too expensive considering. Stock up on your favourites in town for next to nothing and put it in the room fridge which is standard across the board. We paid 640,000 IDR booking online (which was good value) but when we went to rebook with them here in person, they gave us the same room for 500,000IDR! Lesson learned. And they've got stacks of rooms here so if you can wait to book in person, do so. I'd definitely stay here again. And we stayed at an upmarket homestay on the hill and a budget homestay centrally in LBJ when we were here last year so have knowledge of other accomm here. My advice would be: splash out a bit more and come here; you won't regret it."

The place representation was ok, nothing to complain about and the staff was very friendly & very helpful.Location wise - everyplace is around 10 mins from any points in the city. It's not a big city. About 5 mins from Luwansa there is this club, a much scaledown Bali ""Potatohead"", called Atlantis. You can walk by the beach and get there in a zap.There are 2 other hotels around the one that i stayed in, about the same rate and looked nice also. On the way back home from the sea, we had a chance to stop by Luwansa hotel again to get a fresh shower before heading back to the airport ... (Again, around 10 minutes from the hotel)"
"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","Rodzyn","Surabaya, Indonesia","Nice spot for calm and relaxing stay","Outside of the city but hotel provides free shuttle service. Nice big and clean room. Staff very attentive and helpful. Great view on the bay and sun set. A bit of disadvantage is the bar/restaurant next to the beach - it is hot there, especially when there is no wind (couple of fans would solve the problem). Reasonable choice of good quality food. All in all well managed hotel with Indonesian flavor of relaxed approach."
"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","Redskins70","Rome, Italy","Trying hard but some ways to go","This place is fine to stay at - just be patient and flexible as there will be inevitably be some kinks. It like the staff are trying really hard but the systems they have are just not up to par. Wireless internet only works in the lobby area. The beach is not great, there's a lot of trash. It best to use the hotel as a base and then go exploring. The free shuttle is a good service during the day - after 8 pm there is a charge to go into town which is the same as a taxi fare. We thought we had booked a villa but it actually wasn't a separate villa at all - it was a room in a separate building, so we were a little confused by that. Beds are big and comfortable and you will appreciate them after spending a few days on a boat. The hotel doesn't make any arrangements for snorkeling trips, etc.- best to go into town and talk to different dive companies so you can compare prices"
"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","PipeRomeraRodrigo","Malaga, Spain","Average rooms and nice pool area","Hotel located outside Labuanbajo, around 5 minutes by car. We stayed in a hotel room, not a villa, not spacious rooms, bad ventilation in the bathroom as water is not properly drained leading to humidity. Best part is the pool and the restaurant both by the beach. Restaurant is overpriced, food is not bad and service is slow. Not a bad option but mai not because of lack of competitors rather than for its quality."

A great hotel with wonderful gardens and stunning clean pool meters from the beach looking out to the islands. A large coffee bar with great views was used for breakfast and evening meal during the off season. A great time to be there in March as fairly quiet. Met some wonderful people from Holland, Germany, Netherlands, Canada and Australia. The rooms are being refurbished so they were clean and well serviced. Good size and are serviced each day if you wish. Big shower, very efficient aircon. Small bar fridge. The villas have great ocean views. The staff very friendly with reasonable English. There is a free shuttle service and the driver we had had good local knowledge of shops, restaurants etc and where to get the best fresh seafood which you can buy and take back to have cooked by the chef.(Don't know about the peak season). the food overall was delicious. In regards to day or overnight trips there are dozens of operator to chose from. We managed to save AUD$50 per trip by dealing direct with the boat operators but you need to speak Indonesian or know someone who does. A very enjoyable stay and will return."

"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","Rendra H","Jakarta, Indonesia","One of Labuan Bajo's Best","I was on a motorcycle touring trip around the East Indonesian islands and stayed for one night at the Luwansa Beach Hotel. I didn't have any reservation with the hotel and arrived at midnight as a walk-in guest. It was Christmas day and most people at Labuan Bajo celebrate Christmas, including hotel staffs. Many of them were on leave.Surprising to me, I was greeted with a warm welcome by the security guard that guide me to the front office. The night shift front office staff was very good, informative and work swiftly to give me a very nice, clean and cozy superior room with a very unexpected cheap price! During that holiday trip, the one night stay at Luwansa was the best accommodation that I had which really released me from tiredness on the road. The hotel is very nicely setup, clean and friendly. Although I didn't have a chance to go to the beach, I can feel that it will be an excellent experience."

The view and setting is stunning and the shuttle bus means that you can stay outside the town but have no problems getting in and out for free. Also, when we did have a problem with our flights being changed by the airline, the manager did everything he could and did not rest until the problem was solved. Outstanding service, highly recommended. :) Thank you for an amazing stay."

It was a great start to our holiday and really helped us unwind! Our room was large and clean and the pool area was beautiful. The only negative was the lunch service down in the beach front restaurant was a little bit unpredictable - with many menu options unavailable. But what we did eat was always fine! I think 3 nights was perfect, any more and I think we would have started to get a little restless because there is NOTHING to do nearby. That said, we did make use of the free transfer bus into town a few times - and that was very convenient."

Nice clean rooms with modern comforts. Great pool for the kids and nice beach which is very shallow and has no waves. Only small issue they need to sort out the breakfast coupon issue. First day we were told by the waitress no breakfast until we showed coupons. Which my wife then collected from the reception. Today were told no coupons needed. Little bit of communication needed I think. Otherwise well worth staying if in this part of the world"
"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","ScottyC337","Perth, Australia","Nice place, great staff","We came for 3 days, but ended up staying a week. We negotiated a good price for a suite, and the room was very nice. The free shuttle bus saved us a lot in cab fares, and the drivers (as with all the staff) were very helpful.  The downside is that they charge a 21% government tax, which does not exist. This still puts their food and drink at a cheaper rate than the other top hotels, but still!  Restaurant food is good quality, breakfast is average at worst."
"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","ruscom","Melbourne, Australia","Fairly decent beach hotel","I enjoyed my stay at Luwansa, it is quite decent as a 3 star hotel. I had a villa suite which was nice and spacious and had a large bathroom. The location is a bit out of the way, but thats the same with all resorts in Labuan Bajo. We managed to walk to the centre in about half an hour though. The pool is nice, a bit small and is sometimes being cleaned but there aren't too many people so it is alright. The breakfast is also quite decent."

The hotel provides transport to and from the town, and you get to stay in a very pleasant hotel, on the beach, which feels as if there is nothing else around. There is a nice pool and the pool/beachside restaurant provides an adequate breakfast and good meals. The rooms are comfortable and clean, many with nice views of the garden and ocean."
"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","Peter F","","The cleanest hotel I've stayed in","This place is really good value, I'm sometimes a bit dubious about formal hotels, but this one was great. All the staff were very helpful and attentive but not OTT. They provided a free taxi service to the local town where all the best resteraunts were, although the steak I had at the poolside bar was excellent as was all the food including the breakfast. The pool location is great and safe for kids, the sunset view was stunning, and the bed was the most comfortable one I've ever stayed in, in Indonesia. Defiantly recommend this place to a friend, but 3 days is enough."
"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","Geerlings","Utrecht","Nice beach location, great pool","The hotel is new and build in a nice garden right on the beach. The rooms are clean, and spacious but some of the details were not thought out (we had a nice shower in the bathroom, but is came from a hole in the roof and the piping to it was partially stainless steel and partially green plastic). What was also a disappointment was that the Villa's are actually a two story building a bit away from the main building. The rooms there had neither veranda or balcony. The WiFi only works in the reception area and is pretty slow. The hotel restaurant has a nice menu, but many of the dishes listed were not available. As the hotel is about 5 km out of town and there are not many taxi's, you will almost have to eat there.On arrival our complementary driver had already left because the plane was delayed by about 45 minutes (which I think he could have known) so we had to pay for a taxi to get us to the hotel. We were charged IDR 100.000 for making a trip into town, but no offer was mad to reimburse our taxi costs coming in.All in all, the hotel is not bad, but many of the details should be improved to take it to the next level."

"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","PakJekk","Paris, France","Close to perfection","I have been staying in Luwansa resort, LabuanBajo several times in the last 6 months, most of the time in one of the great front-sea 'villas' rooms, after trying other places in town. I've been coming in solo, or with friends, and I have recommended the place to many people travelling in Flores, some I later met a second time here, all very happy for the tip.First, the staff and the manager always smile, do their best to help you in many ways. You feel welcome from the first minute to the last. They can also help you with trips, massages, tours. Just ask. Second, the place is just gorgeous: from the wide open-air reception area to the corridors, to the wide manicured gardens, the pool, the clean beach (it's unusual in Flores), the Komodo outside bar opened all day, and the rooms themselves.Third, the services are unusually good for LabuanBajo, and getting better (good Wi-Fi at the bar, and beginning in the rooms). Laundry is fast and perfect, room cleaning and service excellent, free shuttle almost anytime to and from the city center or the airport.The big buffet breakfast from 6-7 to 10 at the bar by the beach is also not to miss. You understand while you're here that you're in a place where people do their best for the guests. And, by reading the commentaries here on trip advisor I understand that things got better and better recently, which is certainly nothing always easy in LabuanBajo. This hotel is a perfect place to use as a resort (pool, bar, beach with a fabulous sunset..), or as a quiet, safe and clean place to rest before or after a trek in the Manggarai country or a boat trip from Lombok or else, for families (large connecting rooms by the garden), or for a honeymoon."

Our original room stank of cigarette smoke and the staff seemed nonplussed when we said this was unacceptable.Secondly the bar was low on most spirits despite them being on the menu.But the room we were moved to was fantastic; with a huge and very modern bathroom.Better still, the pool/bar area was lovely and then spectacular at sunset with views of the Komodo islands and dinner was really tasty as well. Plus the bill was reasonable and the free pick up was air-conditioned and comfortable.Would strongly recommend it; the best place we stayed in in Indonesia."

The room was quite ok but sometimes a bad smell came from the drainages in the shower and the sink. While the room was actually nice, the rest of the hotel and garden area lacks atmosphere. The pool is very small and for the entire hotel they only had 5 deck chairs at the pool and none at the beach! Sunsets from the pool however are wonderful. The restaurant was ok but not great with slow service. Breakfast was poor with most of the hot items not properly heated and cold. Flies were everywhere. The hotel shuttle to town was convenient but sometimes we had to wait a long time for a pick up. The staff were generally friendly and helpful. The advertised WiFi was not working during our entire stay of 4 nights!!! For Flores standards it was an ok hotel, but I would stay next time at a hotel with more atmosphere."

The hotel has a beach with (murky) waters, a swimming pool, a beach cafe and (slow) WiFi in the lobby. Beautiful view of sunset. The negative: The hotel is located 40 min walk from the center of town and there is no resturants etc. around the hotel. They advertise with free transport, but that is unreliable. I arranged to be picked up at 6 pm. After waiting by the road for 40 min I got Perama Tour&travel to call the hotel, the hotel told me to wait another half an hour. The same thing happened the next day?! As a solo female traveler I really did not like sitting by the road and have every taxi, bemo and ojek hunking at me. But the hoteldriver was nice, probably just overworked. I guess when you are just one person you are not a priority.. When I arrived the first day I asked the reception if I could change from staying there from two nights to just one night, but since I had booked for two nights they simply said no."

Didn't come back either. When asked about it later, they told us that the driver had asked at the restaurant if they had any guests from Luwansa, they had said no and the driver had left.

Unfortunately the Luwansa could only give us a room for one night. We struck problems with ongoing travel arrangements and booking further accommodation. The receptionist Selvi Sadur was fantastic, she ended up sorting out further accommodation as well as flight tickets through the local agency. Her English was excellent and she very patient, as was the driver 'Bony' who took us to the airline office. The hotel was clean, lovely pool, ocean views and polite and smiling staff."
"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","LS6JAN","Leeds, United Kingdom","Great pool and beachfront bar, an over-budget treat","We made the mistake of not booking our chosen accommodation in Labuan Bajo (we tried, but wifi and mobile phone problems prevented us), and were really disappointed to find it full. We'd promised the children a hotel with a swimming pool at the end of our 17 hour bus and 8 hour ferry journey, which is how we ended up spending more than we planned on a bit of an over-budget treat.We were offered a standard or a luxury room; as a family of 5 we opted for the larger luxury room and found it very spacious and indeed luxurious! Now, as budget travellers, you have to bear in mind that we've not stayed in many 'posh hotels' so you may not be quite so impressed, but we absolutely loved the endless supply of soft, fluffy towels, the rainshower, the separate toilet cubicle (possibly the only toilet seat we had in the whole of Indonesia that didn't get soaked by the shower) and the view of the garden and pool.My husband went diving, so I was left to entertain the children, which was easy as all they wanted to do was swim in the pool. There are many sun loungers & umbrellas and the pool is right by the beach, so you can have a lovely view while you relax. There is cold beer available from the restaurant, where the food is pretty good too.The hotel is a little out of town, but there is a free driver service. You just call him and get picked up, or arrange a time to meet. He was always there on time, and drove safely in a big car with seat belts. It's about 5 mins drive to town. There are many, many nice places to eat in town, including a big street food market for cheap eats, right up to high-end Italian food at European prices. We tried both, and found them equally charming in their own ways.We had to pay extra for breakfast as there were 5 of us sharing a room that is really for 2 people, but it was worth it. Most days it was buffet style and there was REAL bacon (wow!), eggs cooked how you want, and the usual selection of juice, tea, coffee & toast etc. It would have been nice to have some more vegetables e.g. tomatoes with the cooked breakfast, and the fruit selection was very basic and the same every day. However, we were full enough to only need 1 more meal in the evening, so it was good value! Some days, when we were the only guests, it was a la carte, but you still got a huge selection, but it was quite slow to arrive.The TV was often on in the restaurant, which we found annoying, but as we were often the only guests, we asked for it to be turned off, and it was, which was nice of the staff. After a couple of days, they started turning it off as soon as we sat down, without us asking, which was sweet.As others have said, wifi is a bit hit and miss and only really strong in the lobby area. However, at least there are some seats in the lobby so you can chill out there for a while and catch up on emails etc.The only downside is that we spent way too much money v's our budget here, but that's not the hotel's fault, and compared to European prices it is very good value for money."

No complaints as to the interior.The hotel is located on the outskirts of Labuan Bajo (around 10 minutes drive by car), but the hotel offers free transportation service with great drivers who can take you anywhere and assist you in finding/buying whatever you want.The beach is literally just next to the hotels pool and restaurant area, and we didn't see anyone trying to sell us stuff.The restaurant was decent, but nothing out of the ordinary. The breakfast is a buffet, and compared to the indonesian standard, it was good. We could choose between bacon, eggs, toast, fried noodles, cereal, and fruit.Lunch and dinner is decent, but maybe a bit over-priced compared to the quality. The tenderloin steak seemed a good idea on the menu, but not recommendable for the 85.000rp (before tax) price. Instead we recommend the other restaurants in central Labuan Bajo. A good alternative is MadeInItaly which serves excellent pizzas and other italian dishes (prices are above average, but probably worth it).While the price might be above average, the free transportation service made it worth the money in our case. You can call and be picked up within 20 minutes, and they will drive you anywhere within reasonable distance. One of the drivers even helped us book ferry tickets to Makassar and go to a local market and buy bananas. For the price, it is a really good place, and we would definitely recommend it. If we come back to Labuan Bajo, we would most likely revisit Luwansa."

Ferdi, his cell 03852443677, is the manager and speaks English well. Boni was one of the day drivers and also speaks English well. We called the day before coming and had them set up a boat tour for us which turned out to be excellent. They were waiting at the airport for us, even with our flight being an hour late. They dropped us off at the pier for our tour and gave us towels which was great thinking ahead because we didn't ask for theme but definitely needed them. They took our baggage to the hotel. The tour(don't know the tour boat owner) cost $150 which included a double decker boat- if you can afford it get it, much smoother, comfortable, and quiter on the second deck - and included 2 snorkeling spots, which weren't very good - the water was nice and ear but nothing really to see, Rinca island, and then the sunset fruit bar watching. We cut the last snorkeling short and went to the village on Rinca which was entertaining because if the kids, they were very photogenic and playful. After the tour they picked us up at the pier. We went to the room and when my wife went to shower the hot water didn't work. After calling they had staff in our room in 5 min and had it fixed very fast. The next day Boni drove us around for about 2 hours while we went to different airlines trying to make plans to get to Moni. All the transportation they provided was free plus tip of course. Boni even retraced our route to find my iPad which I left behind. Also, the breakfast was good, nothing special but it was included and was a buffet so it was easy to get up and go eat and then begin the day. The pool was nice, too.We stayed in Rinca 5 which was nice and comfortable with a semi outdoor bathroom. No tub but a nice rainfall shower head.Cons: the wifi isn't available in the room and doesn't work well in the lobby but I had bought a SIM card and minutes, about $15USD, in Bali so I just used that. If you have an iPhone you can use the hotspot for free so you can use your iPad or laptop with it. "

The villa had a great view was very clean and comfortable with nice daily servicing. The internet does not work most of the time and the breakfast and food in the restaurant is poor. However, the pool is great and the free shuttle service in and out of town extremely convenient. Good price for what you get since flores is relatively expensive compared to bali and lombok, would recommend!"

They were extremely helpful with all our questions and requests and even provided transportation to and from the airport and to all of the activities we wanted to do in the area (cave, trips into town, our Rinca cruise). However, I wouldn't have needed to even do those things -- I would have been very content to spend a day or two at this hotel's pool and private beach. Our room (one of the ""villas"") was spacious, clean, cool (air conditioned), and the bed was very comfortable. We had a beautiful view and sliding glass doors to go outdoors. The outdoor dining area was lovely and our food was delicious. The pool and beach were amazing, including the bioluminescent beach (go to the beach at night and watch the sparkles when you splash the water). Wonderful choice of place to stay in Labuan Bajo."
"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","Mathieu P","Brussels, Belgium","Amazing price for quality","When We got there, we could not belief what we got for the price we paie. Huge room, very clean, a big swimming pool, and a private beach.... The free pick up is also a plus, they come in less than five minute if you call them from town. Dinner is quite good, although a bit more (reasonably) lore expensive than downtown. The breakfast is really ok, exept that the starting tile fluctuates between 6:15 and 7. This is quite annoying whan you have to go diving or go catch your plane. This would be our main critisism. Friendliness off staff widely compensated.Wifi is free only in the lobby, and quite slow, but works.Overal, one of our top 3 price for quality hotel after 6 months of travelling in asia."
"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","Bask87","Verbier, Switzerland","Way to expensive for what they offer","We decided to go for the expensive private bungalows as they advertise on booking.com...it was not a bungalow, they call it villa, and is not a villa. It is just the room facing the sea.The room itself is ok, quite big and with a big bathroom.In the bathroom the sealing had an open spot maybe for some work try did previously, an the grille that separates the window was all broken allowing animals inside the room.I don't mind all those things, but if you book in a 4 star you expect a few attention to details.Breakfast is ok, in line with every other place, near the pool and the beach which are quite nice.Over all it was a good stay, but I don't see the reason for those high price!The shuttle service is really good and fast!"
"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","hanswurscht2014","Cusco, Peru","Delightful stay at the Luwansa Beach Hotel","W stayed at the Luwansa Beach Hotel for 2 days before going to our Lombok targeted Rinca cruise. The staff at the hotel was extremly friendly and helpful. After two weeks in the south of Bali with it's business and everyone wants to sell you something all the time, our experience in Labuan Bajo was the oposite. The hotel staff informed us what to do around the town, offered us free rides with the shuttle to town and the sites and we had some nice conversations with the personal. The rooms were clean and the food was great. If you're used to alcohol, I would recommend the komodo attacks cocktail..kind of an alternative creation of a long island ice tea.Definitely a excellent place to stay during your Labuan Bajo journey!"

"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","voyager52","Newport Beach, California","Good potential","We spent one night after our Komodo trip. The hotel is a bit out of town on the beach. The room was lovely for Flores, this is not Bali,Phuket or Hawaii. The food was good in the restaurant, but the service was horrible. 25 minutes for French fries and chicken wings. The hotel also has Internet speeds from the 1980's and no wifi in rooms. They do have a shuttle to town and airport that makes it very convenient to activites and restaurants.They have flat screen TV in the room but only Indonesian stations. It's only open 8 months so perhaps they will get their act together and wifi the whole hotel at 2014 speed, get some intl stations on TV and seriously train their restaurant staff."
"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","Qwelt","Bangalore","Quite a surprise!","We ( me and my wife) stayed at this place for a night on 7th April, 2014. We actually booked 2N/3D boat trip to go to Komodo Island. On the second night, we decided to go a hotel instead of the boat which was very basic and claustrophobic. Our tour agent, Jeffrey Buana booked this hotel for us. For a remote place like Labuan Bajo, our expectations were minimal. But this hotel turned out to be one big surprise! The room, a lavish bath room, and the full size windows facing the sea were quite comfortable and very modern. We had dinner and breakfast at this place. They provided us vegetarian food during dinner which was quite delicious. The breakfast was very basic and no options. The room service was excellent and prompt. Overall, a nice small hotel really infornt of the sea! and morning walks along the sea was very refreshing! Will definitely recommend this property."

They cut it with small saw and also look for a new lock. Nice.I ate their fish head soup, the broth was good but it became excellent when I add lime green. The others are ordinary, lack a little bit of touch.If you wanna rest peacefully with comfy bed after Komodo trekking than this is the right place."

"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","Mike B","Angola, Indiana","Very friendly place","I stayed here with a friend while we planned our trip to Komodo. The rooms were nice and clean and the staff are very helpful. The hotel is located about 6km out of Labuan Bajo, but the Hotel shuttle bus made coming and going very easy. It was just a matter of going to the front desk and asking for a lift and then ringing the hotel to be picked up from town. There appeared to be only two vehicles, so during peak season there may be a wait if there are lots of people using this service. The restaurant is basic. It is a open air restaurant down by the beach, if the weather is anything but perfect the restaurant may not be ideal. The restaurant also has stiff competition with local restaurants in town. We also found a lot of the menu items were not currently being served. This may have been due to us traveling in off-peak season, but we also found this to be the case with a lot of other places in Indonesia.I would still recommend this place due to the value."
"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","Karen B","Amstelveen, The Netherlands","This hotel simply does not have ""it""","If you have the choice, rather go to Golo Hill top hotel in Labuan Bajo. We came at Luwansa due to administrative mistake with our booking at Golo Hill Top, and we really regretted our move.Yes the hotel has a beach, a pool, a restaurant and an airy and spacious reception area. Free shuttle to and fro Labuan town. The only thing I liked about this hotel was the bed as this was not too firm. But the water in the pool was too dirty to even consider using it, there are not enough chairs and parasols around the pool for the number of guests. The food in the restaurant is ridiculously expensive and the quality of the food is just bad. The atmosphere may be attractive to visitors from Eastern Europe, it's not for Western Europeans. There's a lot of bare concrete, the garden is uninspired, missed opportunity by systematically not having balconies. It is as if the hotel owner does not really understand what visitors want and just copy-pasted some impressions he took elsewhere. The hotel does not have a ""soul""."
"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","Mykhailo S","Kiev, Ukraine","Brilliant and relaxing","I stayed at Luwansa Beach Hotel right after Komodo boat trip and it was the most right place I could even imagine. The hotel is situated in a calm quiet place a bit far from the Labuan Bajo center (in terms of walking distance and road conditions), but they have a unique offer (among of neighbours) of transfer to the LB center and backwards by call, so the distance ""from the crowd"" was a real 100% advantage.The room was, I would say, the best option I could expect in terms of value for money. Great stuff, which could do their best even when the conversation in English was a bit difficult. Thanks to all those people!"
"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","kevintasmania27","Taroona, Tasmania, Australia","What a gem!","We absolutely stumbled onto this place (OK a driver took us there!) with no booking and ended up staying for several days on each of our trips in and out of Labuan Bajo! We found the staff to be lovely and the grounds perfect! The pool is stunning...and it's very peaceful. A good distance from the rather noisy centre of Labuan Bajo! AND the hotel staff would take us in and out of town anytime we wanted!"
"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","irenenevada","Singapore, Singapore","Small rooms, poor maintenance/housekeeping, pity because it's a decent beachside property","My group and I stayed here during a 6-day scuba diving trip. We were upgraded to a ""villa"" room (except for one room, which was strange, why not upgrade everyone?). The standard room that didn't get upgraded was in the main building; the room was very small, not much space to move around when we have our dive gear all unpacked for drying. My friends were trying to dry their dive gear on the balcony (which can be seen from the road), and the staff tried to tell them to bring the gear inside as they are very ""unsightly"". We just ignored them; we paid for the room, so why shouldn't we use the space we paid for?The ""villa"" room was just slightly bigger, but has a balcony overlooking the beach so we had more space for drying stuff. I realize the resort was not set up as a dive resort, so they have no equipment washing area or a lockable shed, so we had to make do with whatever is in our room. That said, it was very inconveniently designed/equipped as a beach resort. There was no outside towel rails (which I would expect in a beach resort), the bathroom is across the room from the front door/balcony door, so if we're dripping wet the entire floor would be (was) soaked. Housekeeping was lackluster, there was a dead bug on the floor when we woke up in the morning, and when we came back in the evening it was still there, swarmed by ants. Towels were not changed if we didn't put it on the floor; if this was some sort of an environmentally friendly move, there should have been a note that tells us about it. We also had a problem with our airconditioning, it was not cold. Despite of informing multiple staff members since day 2, it only got fixed on day 5, a day before we were due to leave. Reception staff was the saving grace of this resort. The lovely girl at reception arranged for massages in our room when available, and at a spa in town. The free transport to town was great even though it gets a bit congested at night when there's only one van/driver on duty.The resort itself is a good-looking beach property, with well-manicured grounds and expansive lawns (which is weird, they have so much acreage, why not make the rooms bigger?). The pool area was great for chilling out after a day of diving, the beach is lovely, and we were endlessly entertained by the cows that came by to graze on the resort's plants and drink the pool water.Breakfast was consistently average (veering towards bad), but if you stick to buttered toasts you'll survive. The restaurant food was slightly better than breakfast, but stupidly expensive. Go to town for better food at lower prices.I don't think I'll be back."
"Labuan Bajo","Luwansa Beach Resort","3","BlondeBunny","Sydney, Australia","Lovely getaway","We were here as a group for a few nights in May as part of a driving trip to Komodo National Park. Overall the place is lovely. Only hotel in the area with it's own beach too. The pool is right on the beach, so it makes for some stunning sunsets as you are having a drink in the pool. The room was very comfortable, nice size, overall the hotel was new, so everything was in good condition. The staff were cleaning everywhere non stop. The staff overall were extremely helpful and friendly. They would go all out to help you any way they can. They drove us to our boat and back every day, and to dinner and shopping trips. Lovely service. Main negative is the food. I must say it's pretty awful! If you order form a menue for dinner or snacks, pretty much don't even try - they either don't have the ingredients or don't know how to cook it. The breakfast selection was ok, you could go for European breakfast - which took a very very very long time to arrive, or an Indonesian version, which was really poor quality - think instant noodles. The pool is very shallow, which is a little bit of a shame. However overall, really great place to stay and I would come back in a heartbeat."

The room perfect (the price is doble than very budget hotel, but it is worth it), and it is beach resort, clean, modern. Personal staff very pleasent, friendly (expecially Mr. Budy), breakfast excellent. Although is far from the center this resort has FREE ride anywhere you want in town and aeroport. Also if you call them anytime they will come to pick you up. Labuan Bajo is not picturesc town, it is ugly point to the beutifull beaches and there is no anything to do in this city. It has some restaurants but you can not stay in the city (no walking street). That is why this resorts is good for the people that want to stay couple of days: has a swimming pool, bar, etc. No noise, but there is nothing around the resort."

We hadn't pre-booked. We simply landed at the airport, and caught a 'taxi' straight to it (it was advertised in the airport), which took about 5/10 mins.The location of the hotel is almost untouched. It had only opened a few months before, and there are signs of this (grass hasn't yet grown in the intended parts, the grounds are not well lit etc), but you can tell that given a bit of time...the hotel has the potential to be amazing. The room was clean and spacious, and the staff were friendly. The meal we ate there was average, and the fact it was so quiet there (people wise) made it seem a bit eerie on the night, but like I said...it hadn't long opened and Labuan Bajo is still only a tourist attraction in development. In 20 years I'd imagine the place to be full of luxury hotels and bars etc. All in all we had a comfortable stay and I'd recommend it for short term stop-overs. It's located close to Labuan Bajo harbour, making it ideal for linking Rinca and Komodo Island trips."

Several things good and a few things missed the mark - but could be sorting out the joys of a new business. Room quality was overall very good. Bed, decor - excellent. Bathroom - top quality, super shower, bright with large windows to the ceiling; downside - no window coverings. So no relief from the hot sun and 'full monty' for all those who cared to look up from the pool. Pool was great, bar area was also very good. Needed some umbrellas out by the pool. Landscaping still being done, but should look excellent in a few weeks/months. Beach area - not great, but being worked on. Lunch was good (stick to local offerings, not the western fare). American Breakfast was not good. Again, stick with the indonesian version. Service at Luwansa was outstanding. Attentive and responsive staff; huge smiles; address you by name; willing to help you enjoy your stay in Bajo. In fact, the GM gave us a lift into town one night. Very kind and gracious host.

We had a 2 hour sail through many of the islands, we were lucky, the weather was perfect for sailing, we had a few hours on Rinja to see the Komodo dragons and have a bit of a trek through the bush, there re a lot around the kitchen area, but they do not feed them, we saw a couple in the wild, also the odd wild pig and deer. We had a guide with a pole in case they got too close and then there were a couple of bouts of snorkelling for my husband and my daughter, they enjoyed that, one of the boys threw some chicken skin in the water and the fish all came up to the surface, the colours were beautiful. A highlight was a big fish swimming around the boat which the boys threw a hand line into the water and took about half an hour to land it - it was a 20kg trevally which they kept watered and would sell at the market when they got back to Flores. We visited Komoda the next day and was much the same as Rinja, there were 3 different length of treks and we opted for the middle ones - around 2 hours. We also got to see the manta rays and the fruitbats in their thousands. It was well worth the trip and too much to put into a review, so if anyone wants any more information they can contact us and we will be pleased to reply. I would certainly recommend the hotel."

The food could do with improving so only stay in if you really can't face the trip into town. I didn't have a scooter but would recommend one of you stay here for more than a couple of days. In the afternoon heat the trip back from town is a killer. The main road is still quiet enough to walk along and there's always Paradise Bar on the way too! A trip in at night takes you past the night markets which are busy with locals. I booked via email and found the owners really helpful. The airport transfer was organised and waited for me when my flight was an hour late. They also recommended a great Komodo boat trip."

We organised the boat trip to Komodo through the owners & they couldnt have been more helpful. Nice to stay slightly out of town with the best view in the area across the bay. highly recommend.Pool area could do with some shade & that might make the pool a bit cooler than the 34c we encountered. Still just a small distraction from a great stay."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Nadira158","Brisbane, Australia","Great service & satisfied with rooms","My husband and I stayed overnight before our 3D/2N live-on-board the next day. With the way the staff pays attention to you, wouldn't expect this to be a one-star hotel. They were quick, attentive and helpful. Even let us borrowed an adaptor for our charger for the rest of our trip in Labuan Bajo.Location, given the size of Labuan Bajo even though this is slightly out it was no problem. I am a slow-walker and it took me less than 15 minutes to walk to the city center and the walk was enjoyable with greeneries on the left and the sea on the right - but do becareful of cars and motorcycles as there are no pedestrian side.No TV in room but I thought it was smart of them to have a fan AND aircon. Aircon does take a while to cool things down so in the meantime the fan was really helpful. Also, who needs TV when you look outside. Clean bathroom with good air pressure, please do note that water can be scarce in Labuan Bajo so be mindful.I'm not too keen on the food (I am a picky a eater) I find them too oily but there juices are refreshing.Due to the weather of the area, the pool is never cold even in the evenings but then it's a great time to take a dip, look at the stars and see the bats swiping on the water where bugs are hanging out to hydrate.All in all, would definitely come back if I'm ever in the area again."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Gill G","western australia","Super stay- exactly what I was after","So happy with Golo Hilltop on many levels.Pre-stay the communication via email was excellent- timely, smooth and friendly.We booked package 5 with several inclusions- a driver collected us and took us the 10 minutes that it takes to the hotel. Checked in by the very friendly Marielle who was a font of knowledge. The local staff were also pleasant.The location of the hotel was fantastic- up a long and winding hillside with sensational views of the bay- the topography reminded me a bit of Thailand with lots of small islands close to shore and lots of fishing boats around. It was an easy downhill walk into the town and a strenuous one back up again (or take local transport).We had chosen the deluxe rooms at the top of the hill and they were awesome. Basic but super clean, super views and a super breeze sitting out on the verandah. Rooms had good a/c and fans and wifi. Water was supplied FOC for you to refill your water bottles. If you were infirm or unfit you might want to take the lower level rooms. My parents managed them using the handrail (btw- good lighting at night too) on the stairs but said they'd take the lower level ones if they went back.Small restaurant menu at very reasonable prices. Nice juices and ginger tea!Lovely pool with a view with umbrellas for shade.Good for small wildlife too- saw a small green tree snake one morning and zillions of geckos around the lights at night. There were also lots of small birds flitting around in the bushes- sunbirds perhaps. If you are a bird lover bring binoculars.The package (#5) we chose was faultless- highly recommended trip.Really hope to visit again- thanks to all."

I would recommend staying here to anybody.They are obviously used to people coming and going on various tours, and they make that process easy also.Do not be disappointed that there are no TV's in the room - there are too many other things to do here!I do hope I get back there someday - my son already wants us to book it for next New Year!!"

Our only regret was that the place was so popular it was only available one night!I totally recommend the place. It is perched on a hill with gorgeous gardens a short stroll to the main part of town.Also, make sure you try the AC first. The AC in our room ended up being quite noisy and some of my travel companions couldn't sleep (I personally sleep through thunderstorms so it wouldn't bother me)."

We can only give it our warmest recommendations. The rooms were clean and the service was excellent. We got help with flight bookings, with hotels in other parts of Flores, transport etc. No issue was too trivial. Gold Hilltop were full at other times during our stay in Labuan Bajo, so we also stayed at two other hotels in this town. Based on the other two experiences it is safe to say that at Golo Hilltop, you get real good value for money."

Sometimes the locals stoped me and asked if i wanted a free ride, so its a small problem.All in all i realy nice Place :-)"

I pre-booked 3 months in advance with Judith and Ingrid (owner/managers) and their effective correspondence ensured a guaranteed pickup on airport arrival and a plan for 7 more days exporation of Flores. It only took 20 minutes to walk downhill into the village each day but we took the ""ojek"" (motorbike taxi) uphill back home! 50% deposit payment, for our stay and onward escorted travel, was paid in Euros to their bank account in Nederlands. We had a comfortable deluxe room with a good view from a high vantage point. Breakfast was good and we had two good evening meals there. Our very well organised onward tour was:Day 1: Labuan Bajo - Dintor (Waerebo Lodge)Day 2: Trek (Waerebo - local traditional house)Day 3: Dintor - Ruteng (Hotel Susteran, Catholic Mission, Ruteng)Day 4: Ruteng - Bajawa (Hotel Happy Happy, Bajawa)Day 5: Bajawa - Moni (Kelimutu Ecolodge, Moni)Day 6: Moni - Maumere (Seaworldclub, Maumere)Highly recommended.

"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Juan Ignacio I","","Nice view but service no so nice","Fisrt time that I write a review with less than 4 points after a month in Indonesia. We made a reservation in agoda.com, where says 2 single bed/double bed, but once we where there they said that on line reservations are for single bed, so I showed the reservation, but since he was conviced that is was not his problem, we accepted. Is noy a big problem be separated one night, even you expect a positive actitude or intention to solve a problem, things that never occurred.Also as facilities they offer airport transfer, that service is on their criteria to call a friend with an old car, without aircon a charge more than a regular taxi.Hotel is nice, according to a 1 star hotel, the view is really great, but there a better option and for sure best service for the same price."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","ST4347","Jakarta, Indonesia","Feels like home","Very much enjoyed my stay here following our LOB trip to Komodo. The uphill location of this hotel gives the privilege of a breathtaking view from just about anywhere in the property. Easy access, with city centre being 5 minutes away. The Dutch owner is very friendly and accommodating, even offering an extra bed free of charge just so that we could get adjacent rooms. It is quite a few steps up to get to the room, but after all those climbing and hiking we did in the past couple of days, this one is a walk in the park. Room is basic yet very comfortable. Aircon works perfectly much to our delight, given Labuan Bajo's scorching heat. Bathroom very clean. Nice bed with fresh linen. Had a very good quality sleep. Breakfast is ala carte with Western and Indonesian options to choose from. The highlight of this hotel is definitely the captivating views, let it be from the room balcony, the dining area or the swimming pool. The pool itself is another highlight. Not too big, but the warm water is very welcoming, with a view that words could hardly describe. I could have stayed in the pool all day. Not exactly the place to catch a perfect full sunset, but good enough for me. Wifi works perfectly at the poll and common area but a bit patchy in the room. But hey, who needs one when there's so much to indulge in?"

I have to admit that the view from the room is to die for!The room is very big. Cool and calm but u might find that you can hear people talking from the other room.The bed is comfortable to lay down and the toilet also good. There's also a wifi but who needs wifi here anyway?This hotel also provide a breakfast. The menu and portion of the breakfast is good and adequate. The cafe also facing a spectacular Labuan Bajo coast."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","WinR","Wehl, Netherlands","Hotel with a view","Golo Hilltop hotel is nicely located (the name says it already) ,,,, on top of a small hill and therefore providing a nice view to the bay in front of the hotel. This view is especially nice during sunset but not the best location for shooting stunning sunset photographs (which is from the road facing the harbour).The hotel is popular among Dutch tourists which is probably due the good value it offers and maybe due to the fact that the owner is Dutch.The room, bedlinnen and bathroom are clean and generally the hotel is properly maintained.There is a restaurant where you can have a basic breakfast and a quite limited choice of (basic) Asian and European food.A nice, small swimming pool with a beautiful view to the bay gives you somewhat cooling after visiting the komodo dragons ....The location of the hotel is not too far from the ""downtown"" (walking distance) but outside the hustle bustle of the town and therefore reasonably quiet.Free wifi is available but the signal is weak, especially if your room is further away from the restaurant.In short, a nice hotel for people who do not need 4 or 5 star level of comfort/luxury."

Judith and Ingrid were very helpful and friendly and also arranged a boat trip to Komodo and Rinca for us. Great communication and very reassuring with regards to my uncertainty about snorkeling (I was scared, but I tried it and it was great)!The hotel is blessedly quiet and away from busy little Labuan Bajo which is a ten minute walk down the hill. We only attempted the walk back once, preferring to jump on the little bus-van thingys for the most part, which were cheap and easy.Paradise Bar is an easy 2 minute walk for a night out but bring a torch for the walk back.Judith was on hand at the hotel every day and always made a point on checking on all the guests - Thanks so much Judith :-)Our room was private, huge and had everything we needed - including kettle and fridge (hooray!) and had beautiful views from the patio seating area.The hotel also has a peaceful pool next to the restaurant (which stocks Bintang Beer for those who are interested!) with gorgeous sunset views - grab a sun lounger before 6pm!Basically, you have three types of hotel to choose from in this area - in the middle of town are simple backpacker digs, the Golo Hilltop is more boutique and a little bit away from the hustle bustle and then there are all the All-Inclusive style places that are miles away and generic and you can't really tell that you're on Flores.... I'm so pleased we chose the Golo Hilltop."

But I want my review to be fair so here are the good parts of golo,First, the owners are very nice. They gave me some useful informationSecond, for a 30$ room I got an independent bathroom and a swimming pool (although both of them are small)Third, the view is good.Puri Sari has its disadvantage.

The bungalow was clean and had a nice terrasse with an amazing view over the whole Komodo area. The only improvement we see is the water pressure in the showers.

The grounds are immaculately maintained with lush, mature flowers and plants. We decided to have a chillaxed day and because most people come here to dive we had the pool and resort to ourselves. Breakfasts are basic but the fruit and bread are fresh and the pancakes are delicious- just like my Mum used to make. Having free water refills saves on the plastic and carting it up the hill. Great touch. We came back from a long 12 hour trip and ordered a beer and sandwich which was great and just what we needed. Plus it saved a trip into town when we were both tired.

We love it here, the pool is an absolute godsend and overlooks the stunning bay. Staff are friendly and helpful but discreet and not bombarding you with attention. We had excellent wifi in our room high up (again worth it for the views) good air con and a fan as well as good bathroom facilities. We stayed almost three weeks and hired a scooter for the 5 min drive to town. The hotel can order you a Bemo (tiny public minibus) to arrive any time, even early morning or late evening costing very little. We are diving most days and through chatting with others it seems you can pay a lot more and have less.....you can also pay a lot less but if like us you are no longer in your 20s and 30s then this is perfect. We do seem to have struck lucky. Will definitely be back."

It is a smallish operation too so it feels personal and friendly. The pool, whilst not huge, was also a welcome treat. The closeness to LBJ means that you there are lots of food options for you at night which was great for us as I didn't find the food options too inspiration at Golo Hilltop.

The menu was not long, but the food was excellent and lots of it.I had read in a Lonely Planet review that there are 'concrete bungalows' here at Golo Hilltop - so I had expected this, but ignore this outdated advice as you can see only a few of the bungalows behind their gardens - the rest are hidden by gorgeous flowers, shrubs and trees. (Actually the review may have be outdated as the book came out in 2012 so it would have been a 2011 review). Overall I would stay again as the views were stunning! Stunning! Stunning!

The views are fantastic! The pool is lovely! The staff are helpful and Flores is amazing! The scuba diving in Komodo is the absolute best! Enjoy!"

"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Sally M","Barwon Heads, Australia","Fabulous views in a peaceful part of town","Magnificent views of the harbour and islands from every room. The colourful flower-filled terraces and surrounds of the pool are beautiful. The hosts are welcoming and very helpful with planning activities. The only downside is the difficulty getting wifi from the hotel but it is possible to get this from restaurants and bars in Labuan bajo which is a 20-30 minute walk from the hotel. Or a cheap taxi ride. The rooms and meals are basic but adequate but the view makes up for any shortcomings! My teenage son and daughter and I stayed here with friends for 4 nights and visited the island of RInca to see the komodo dragons and then island hopping for snorkelling. Highly recommended."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Giselle E","","best pool on the island","The pool alone is worth the visit. Hotels are limited on this island and this is by far the nicest one. A serious trek up a steep road from the main strip of restaurants and the docks, but really beautiful and quiet as you get your own little bungalow. I would HIGHLY recommend packing a head lamp or flashlight as the walk up and down the road is pitch black in places and tough to navigate as street lights are limited. Taxis are also few and far between and pretty pricey."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","CSPET","London, United Kingdom","Best spot in the area","I stayed here for two nights in June, at the end of a two week trip. It really is a beautiful spot with great views over Labuan Bajo and the port. The sunset from here is simply stunning. The rooms are clean, neat, tidy, air-con is good and the shower is hot. There is also a fridge and a mosquito net provided. The pool area is also a nice touch and the view from the poolside excellent. The whole place has a detached chilled out vibe which instantly relaxes you. In terms of what to expect, it's not in the same category as a 4 or 5 star hotel but it doesn't try to be, it has its own very unique feel. That said it's much more comfortable than a backpacker type option. From the hotel you're about 2 minutes from the nearest bar which is the Sunset bar and about 10 minutes from the fish market and town. I'd recommend a trip to the fish market for a dinner on at least one of your nights here. You can pick up beers from the supermarket across the road and watch them cook the fish of your choosing right there."

Nice pool; small restaurant which serves a good nasi goreng.Ultimately you are here for the location, be aware however be aware that it is an exposed hillside which receives a lot of sunlight during the dry season. Flores is in general much drier than Java or Bali. Pack sunscreen keep up the fluids. View however is magical."

The rooms, while very basic, were clean and comfortable. The restaurant, while choices limited, served cheap good food. The staff and Owner were so friendly and made us feel at home. They also arranged a private boat for us to Komodo and it was amazing! The views from the hotel and pool were amazing and the sunsets were unforgettable! Best place to stay in Labuan Bajo in my opinion! Terrific!"
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Lara P","","Great place, perfect sunset!","Rooms are clean and big. This counts for all the rooms, I stayed in the deluxe and superior. The upperrooms have a better view. The staff is very nice and not stalker-eager to help you (which is a big plus). The best part is chiling around the pool before sunset, this is the best view from Labuan Bajo! Don't forget to be a bit early at the pool, so you can sit on a bed/chair. At night you can walk down to the Paradise Bar (max 5 min) but they don't do food. Only 3 snacks. You can walk further down to town for dinner which is max 20 min down. Try to ask somebody to go with you, it's really dark walking down. Or take a flashlight."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Eva T","Jakarta","Getaway Place","To be Honest, I don't know the rate of Golo Hilltop. Simply because I went with a tour and I paid for full range. And Golo Hilltop already included. But, tbh, My tour cost was very cheap.Okay, this resort located upside the hill, where all the windows have view right to the beach and sea. Amazing.One thing for sure, it has no TV inside, and the toilet is western style. if you could understand me, for Indonesian, a bit uncomfortable with this kind of toilet :p You can also bring your own mineral water, they don't give it as complimentary.The breakfast was nice. I have no problem with the breakfast. It's not like buffet, but you can choose anything on their menu.they also have Wifi, but the signal isn't that good if you use it inside your room, but if you go out a bit on your terrace, the Wifi is good.Thus place is nice.. but, If I go to Labuan Bajo again, I might wanna try another resort.. For experience of course :)"

They were very helpful in referring me to another couple of hotels: Luwansa Hotel or Laprima were recommended. I should mention that finding a motorbike/taxi from here is challenging and should be considered if you are diving the next morning (7:20am starts.) However it's about a 20 minute walk (downhill) to the city, where all the dive shops are."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","SaleemMusallam","Tampa, Florida","Incredible View! Must book!","I loved this small hotel, they dont have that many rooms and all seem to have a great view. Ask for the highest level room available just after you book. If you are visiting there to go see Komodo Dragons, I highly recommend NOT booking with a tour company. Rather, fly into LBJ in the morning, go to the shipping docks and walk around. You will see many boats with their captains there, you can negotiate with them directly to get the best bargain. You will also be able to see first hand what the boats look like and compare.As for a hotel, this one is a no-brainer. They book up quick, so be sure to reserve a room as soon as you decide to go."

"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Seapen","Perth, Western Australia","Wonderful friendly service that matches the view","This was an excellent introduction to Flores hospitality! From the moment I walked into Reception I was helped to feel completely at home. Then there was the stunning view from the verandah of the neat, clean bungalow. It didn't matter that there was no TV in the room - the view outside surpassed anything you'd see on the box anyhow! They were working on getting consistent wi-fi to the rooms, but the connection in the resto was reliable.Breakfast choice & quality were good. The lunch/dinner menu was a bit short on choice, which was understandable for a small establishment. For those craving greater variety, it's only a short walk to town. The walk is easy for anyone with at least a moderate level of fitness. However, caution is required due to the narrowness of the road and the absence of verges - a bright torch and highly visible clothing is recommended for any 'evening strolls'."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","JoLeila","","Loved this place!","This was my favourite accommodation during my entire 1-month trip to Indonesia, which is saying a lot, because I did splurge on a couple upper-mid-range hotels.The property and views were spectacular., and location up the hill was a big plus for getting a quiet night's sleep. Rooms were simple, but had everything you need, and were above all impeccably clean and very bright and airy. The AC worked, we had a fan and mosquito net if we wanted to use them (didn't need to), comfortable bed, front porch with sitting area, breakfast included, lovely pool...all at an absolutely fair price. Communication with the managers/owners was always prompt and crystal clear.Nothing at all was missing, the place was just my style, and I would have loved to stay longer!"

"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Qijia F","shanghai","Perfect place to relax in LB","To follow the No.1 rating hotel, you know you will never make any big mistake. However, Golo Hilltop still surprised me at the moment we arrived. The marvelous view towards the sea, the numerous flowers, the friendly staff and owners. It's a bit away from the LB Harbor, but it's also away from all the noises. And how flexible and reasonable they treat the guests also impressed me a lot. My flight to LB was changed to the next day by the airline 2 weeks before arrival, and they immediately accept the adjustment of the hotel booking. All the rooms are directly facing to the sea and surrounded by the beautiful flowers. the room is simple but very comfortable, actually the matress was one of the best i have ever experienced, make me think about my grandma's home. when you sit in the little balcony enjoy the sunset, you will never want to leave there. It's true that there is not much choice on food, but the hotel does provide sufficient for breakfast. and they also charge reasonably for the drinks when you want to relax in the afternoon after coming back from the cruise trip. If you walk down to the town for about 15 mins, you can have very fresh sea food beside the harbor with very very reasonable price. So if you are not happy with the basic food in the hotel, you will have enough choice in the town. so this is no problem for us at all. Also the talk with the owner Miella was really enjoyable, the way she lives, the passion she has is incredible. you can never imagine that she is already a grandma. We also book the Rinca island cruise to see the famous Komodo dragon via the hotel staff Peter, the trip was gorgeous, everything arranged nicely. The only thing is the price is much higher than the other travel agent you actually can find easily in the town. I was told that the boat provided was bigger and safer, however, when we were in Rinca island, I do not see any boat smaller than ours, so i suspect if you book the trip via other agent, the quality will be similar but with only half of the price. I think this maybe the only drawback i see from the stay at Golo. all in all, we enojoyed very much the stay at Golo Hilltop, definitely the best choice if you come to Labuan Bajo."

Very good value for money - quiet, nice staff, basic but adequate rooms, lovely swimming area. Big let down with the food - as we had a baby in the party once we had come back from all day trips on the boat we just wanted to eat in the dining room - not a good idea, very little choice and none of the (six?)items any great shakes. Even on the fishing boats we were given a better spread. Pity, as everything else was great - if you can, stay here but eat out....."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","AshishGuptasfo","San Francisco, California, United States","Great views, clean rooms, courteous staff ","We were on a tour and elected to stay here because of the great tripadvisor reviews. The hotel is situated just outside of the main town so it is very quiet. The grounds are well maintained and everything is very clean. We were put in room 10, which is a climb to the top with 57 stairs but well worth it, the view is amazing.The rooms are very clean and they even provided a hot water kettle for tea/coffee. The restaurant menu is extremely limited and it's not a good choice to eat here. The lunch sandwiches we had them pack for us were not that great. The hotel organized a taxi down to town for dinner and to bring us back but we felt it was extremely expensive at 50,000 IDR each way. The hotel is affordable, clean and comfortable, not giving it 5-stars due to the lack of food, they had no change, and outrageous amount they charged for taxi."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","BongobabeTz","Sydney, Australia","Service should be better for that price","We stayed at golo hilltop for 4 nights in January 2015. The hotel is nice and clean and has great views.After the first night I had to check out on very late notice for the last minute chance to get on a dive liveaboard. Checkout is at 12pm, I informed the hotel at 1pm that I will checkout the same day and asked for the late check out fee. I was informed that I will need to pay 1/2 room price as a late check out fee. Not great but understandable and common practice. I told the staff that I will be leaving the hotel and be picked up at 3.30pm for my trip and went to my room to pack. From now the cleaners knocked on my door every 5-10 minutes to let me know that they would need to clean the room. Despite me telling them that I would need 1hr to pack, they continued chasing. They even waited outside my room and watched me packing inside so that I had to close the curtains as I felt harassed. When i discussed this with the manager, he apologized however started arguing that he only charged me half of the room price instead of full room rent for late check out. Because of the nice location and the hotel being a good experience so far, we returned back to golo after our dive trip.The next incident with the same manager was a couple of days later with my dad. The night before my dad had inquired about tours to Rinca island, however he didn't confirm anything with the hotel. Because of the travel schedule not being very suitable for us and the high price we decided to book our tour for the next day with someone else. The next morning we learned from that same the manager that he was apparently waiting for us to start the tour. We found this very pushy, especially as we at no point confirmed anything with him or the hotel. When we checked out we paid parts of our bill via credit card. The credit card machine was out if paper and therefore couldn't print a customer copy. However on display the transaction was approved. Once new paper had been inserted, the staff wanted us to swipe our credit card again. We refused as the transaction had been approved and we didn't want to pay twice. Another 5 minutes of discussions with the staff followed until they finally called the bank to get confirmation on our previous transaction.the transaction had go through ok.Overall it's a nice hotel, the location and view are beautiful. The rooms are clean and the air con can be a real blessing at times. The food is good, but the menu limited. Breakfast is very basic. The hotel organized a scooter for me which I recommend for everyone who wants to commute between town and the hotel. It's a bit of a walk otherwise. Tours are offered through the hotel, however you find them cheaper and more tailored to your needs in town. I was disappointed with the customer service of the hotel. I believe this must be down to lack of appropriate training of the staff in customer service. At the time Golo was one of the top end hotels in Labuan bajo, and I wished the staff would have reflected that.I can recommend golo for its views and location, and the nice rooms. However the customer service wasn't great considering the category of hotel."

After a bumpy flight in pretty rough weather, where the pilot announced we would “attempt” a landing, our first port of call was the bar for a couple of welcome cold beers. What a view, and the beers were good too.The hotel is basic but clean, and in a fabulous location to sit and drink in the views. The owners were away in Bali when we stayed, so we did not meet them, but the staff were friendly and efficient in a laid back way.As the hotel is a bit out of town we ate there: the food was fine and the view excellent, so no need to journey into town to eat.If we are in Labuan Bajo again we would certainly stay here again."

The view is great, the rooms comfortable but minimally air conditioned...at least our room, 4, had a feeble output, but at least it kept the room at a more comfortable temperature than outside. We, being 79 and 80, didn't feel like walking down the hill to a restaurant, so we took all our meals at the restaurant in the hotel. A very limited menu, but I really liked the noodle soup. There is wifi that usually works, albeit very slowly and without much bandwidth, but that's not why we came here."

The rooms are basic but big and everything works properly. The gardens and pool are very well maintained and a joy to stay in.The staff is friendly and always willing to help you and give you information. Breakfast is simple and good. Other food in the restaurant is very simple and you probably are better of eating in town.Labuan Bajo is a fast growing place with a big variety of restaurants and bars. Don't forget to have fresh fish on the evening market.The walk from Golo to town takes about 10 minutes and is a nice walk. Going down to town is an easy walk, the way back takes some more effort :-). We were diving almost every day so we did not do a lot of sightseeing. Only our last day we had a short trip which was arranged by the Golo staff. I understood they can arrange all kind of trips if you tell them what you would like to do."

Yes, the Hotel is on a hill outside Labuan Bajo and there are steps to negotiate to the upper rooms, but you are rewarded with a stunning outlook over the bay and peace and tranquility. Judith was very welcoming and helpful with trip ideas. If you don't have much time we can recommend the 2 day Komodo Island boat trip and a night at Wae Rebo - both unique experiences, that you will be talking about for a while to come.

The only slight drawback is the fact that if you don't like walking up hills, you'll probably want to get taxis back up from town. Having said that, you don't get a hilltop view without getting to the top of hill."

Our room was clean and comfortable, all the rooms appear to have amazing views. The restaurant served a basic breakfast menu, but it was all you needed and cooked well, after that time to relax by the amazing pool and it's great views.

"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","ShazDwn","Darwin, Australia","A good choice","When I travel I usually like to stay in the thick of things, but I quickly realised I had made the right choice staying a bit further out of Labuan Bajo to escape the chaos and noise of the main town (plus another couple advised the call to prayer at the local mosque woke them VERY early in the morning when staying in town). Golo Hilltop is about a 15min walk downhill to the main part of the Main Street. 10 000 IDR will get you a motorbike taxi back up if you don't feel like walking. The hotel itself is clean and comfortable with a seaview. The deluxe rooms are simple, but have a fridge and a safe which are both great to have. Aircon works well too. The rooms are only cleaned when you ask for it which I thought a bit odd at first, but it really wasn't a problem. The staff were friendly and helpful, giving us ice when we asked for it so we could have a drink on our balcony and even lending us towels to take on an overnight boat trip. The restaurant menu is extremely limited. We ate here a couple of nights and it would have been good to have a bit more choice.Overall I was very happy with my choice of hotel and think this place is the best pick in Labuan Bajo."

The pool is the absolute highlight of the hotel...very clean and refreshing and you could easily spend all day just relaxing and enjoying the view. The rooms are clean, but not really outstanding. The 2 room types only differs in the view (couple of metres higher), but are the same in terms of interior. So I recommend the cheaper superior room. There are 2 downsides....firstly, the breakfast is really no good (the plain eggs and toasts had no taste at all)....secondly, the hotel is far outside from the centre of Labuan Bajo. So you always have to pay a driver for 50.000 Rp per way (which is expensive for this kind of service) in order to get to to the restaurants and bars.

This hotel feels like a million miles away from town even though it's just around the corner (approx 10 minute walk). This hotel is clean, spacious, comfortable and very peaceful. Golo Hilltop has a lovely pool area. Set into the hill, the view of the bay below is beautiful (spoilt just a little by an electric pylon - this certainly didn't spoil it for us but I'm sure someone would complain if this is not mentioned). Sitting on your private balcony with a beer, watching the sun setting was so tranquil and peaceful. You will need a torch if you plan to walk back after a night out in town as there are no street lights. It's all up hill but it's not too steep and not too difficult, my husband and I are in our 50's and we walked both in to town and back home again both nights, calling in at the Paradise Bar half way between town and the hotel certainly helped to energies us for the final leg (haha). Would we stay here again? YES we would. We don't really do the high end luxury accommodation as we usually stay and dive in the dive centers whenever possible but we always try end our holiday with a few nights in a nice hotel. This was the perfect end to our stay in Labuan Bajo."

So we decided to go to Bayview gardens hotel to speak with Graham and in one minute all that we want become real, the same trip only for 800000 rps and it was spectacular."

The view overlooking the sea was very peaceful and the pool a welcome place to relax and refresh . Breakfast was included and delicious . We ate our evening meals there and were very happy with the choice , although a small menu it is local Indonesian and enough choices to satisfy any requirement ie vegetarian . Prior to our stay here I had many email conversations with Judith and Ingrid as I had been trying to organise a full day boat trip to see both Komodo and Rinca Islands but had unsatisfactory attempts before asking Judith and Ingrid . Consequently They organised with a local guide ,Lexy and a boat crew a package to suit our request . What a brilliant day leaving at 5am the kitchen staff kindly packed us a breakfast pack to eat on our way (2 hrs to get to Komodo ) The day was all we had hoped for and more Komodo Dragons, Timor deer , wild pig. The rare yellow crested cockatoo. ! a Dolphin on the way and not forgetting our crew who cooked delicious food including afternoon banana fritters . My husband snorkled in the clear waters of pink beach and we found our local villiage Dragon guides had a good sense of humour as the led us Dragon spotting with their protective forked stick . If we had more time it would be nice to stay on the boat overnight .Lexy was a brilliant guide and host for the day . After our incredible day it was very relaxing to cool off in Golohilltop pool , enjoy a beer or fresh juice with dinner with beautiful views of sunset . We walked into Labuan Bajo a couple of times down hill and although no official taxis it wasn't hard to find someone to get a lift back for a small amount of Rupiah . We were actually planning to stay at Golohilltop 3 night but our afternoon flight from Denpasar (Garuda) was in essence cancelled due to current work on Labuang Bajo runway ... Long story but until runway renovations are completed I would suggest getting only a morning flight from Denpasar to LB and the same when returning . All part of the holiday adventure . Highly recommend a stay at Golohilltop and being able to organise our komodo package ahead made it so much easier than searching for a guide and boat upon arrival . Thank you Judith , Ingrid and your lovely staff for our memorable stay at your paradise on the hill . Judy and Mark Goodson"
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","bakkepackers","Arlington, Virginia","Great pool and views","It's a little more expensive than most places in Labuan Bajo, and it's a bit out of town, but it's completely worth it. The owners are incredibly nice and helpful, they were great when our flight got cancelled and did a lot of work to make sure we got booked on another one. Plus the place has good food, amazing views, and a big pool. It's a bit of a walk to town but not too far. Wifi was very good, though only in the main area, it didn't reach to the rooms."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","jfromsyd","","A bit out of town, great views and a pool","We stayed for one night, the room was nice enough for Flores standards, clean with hot water. The gardens are lovely and awesome views from the pool. It's about 1.5k from town, a bit of a uphill walk, but you can always get a car to take you. Breakfast was the usual staples, eggs or pancakes."

Food choice is limited, but nice. Efficient staff. Bit far from other restaurants. They can arrange tours on the island and we did their large 10-day tour, which was terrific."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Rduquesnoy","Waalwijk, The Netherlands","Excellent hotel","We stayed here one week in august. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, good working (hot water) shower and you have both air-conditioning and a fan. The views over the ocean are, as mentioned before, just stunning. Breakfast was tasty but the portions where small (as divers we had to last 2 dives before we got lunch, quite a challenge). Twice we had dinner at the restaurant, choice is limited but the food is very well prepared. The other evenings we had dinner in one of the restaurants in town or Paradise Bar & Restaurant which is located just a few minutes downhill from the hotel. The walk to town wasn’t a problem, took us about 15 minutes. We brought a small flashlight for the way back in the evening. As we went diving during the day we didn’t have time to use the pool ourselves but the area looked clean and well maintained. Arranging an excursion or daytrip is also easy, just let them know what you want to do the next day and everything will be arranged. We will definitely stay here again would we ever return to Labuan Bajo."

The sunsets will stay with you forever! The breakfast was also tasteful, standard but good. It's a nice walk downhill to the center of Labuan Bajo, where you will find a lot of restaurants. We found the menu of their ""restaurant"" a bit to limited and we craved something Italian (see next review) so i cannot review this.Also a bonus: beds where provided of mosquitonets.Very nice place to stay, recommended!"

Everything very clean and tidy. Friendly owner. Met Peter (travel fixer who we can recommend) and organised a boat trip to Rinca. We had the boat to ourselves and a lovely family that cooked a delicious lunch on the way. Peter then also organised driver Jammin (also recommended) who took us across Flores.P.S. Bring a torch for the walk down to the town in the evening (ca. 20 mins)."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","hansiHolland","Holland","Still one of the best","After 2013, this is our second visit to Golo. The owners did some renovation of the old rooms as they promissed me last year. Although a 15 minute walk uphill from the town centre, it's still one of the best places in LB, with amazing sunsets an views from the poolside. Book in advance, the place gets full quickly. The price is right for what you get. Keep up the good work ladies!"
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Beacygirl","Perth, Australia","Fabulous value for both the lovely rooms and beautiful views.","Golo Hill top is a fabulous Hotel set up on top of the hill to the right of the bay (left of the main town). We stayed in a deluxe room which was up an additional two or three flights of stairs from the reception. I walk with a cane and the climb was no problem and there is a rail and lighting. The views from the balcony were outstanding. The room was really large, very clean with good storage space and a safe (also everything else you need, towels, toiletries fridge, a/c, fans etc). There is a large bathroom/wet room with a hot rain shower (the long handle squidgy provided to use after a shower is a great idea). The pool is lovely and has views across the bay. There is also a fabulous restaurant a short walk away. The staff were friendly and happy to arrange a bemo anywhere. This was a little more expensive than you pay for the return trip but I just saw that as a pick up charge. If you want to save some money it would be easy enough to flag down a passing bike. I would definitely stay at this place again.Sumbawa fast ferry.FYI. Our next stop was Sumbawa. We weren’t looking forward to a long 8+ hour ferry ride and hallelujah!!! there is now a fast ferry (Bahari Express - timetable attached). There was even a flushing western toilet! The ferry departs Labuan Bajo on Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 9am (VIP class Rp150 000 and Executive class Rp 130 000) and arrives 3 hours later into Sape. It left later than the slow ferry, ripped passed it and arrived on time. On Monday and Friday the ferry then proceeds to Sumba (VIP Rp 200 000 Executive 170 000). The ferry departs for Labuan Bajo from Waikelo, Sumba (9am) and then Sape, Sumbawa (12noon) on Tuesday and Saturday. There is an extra trip just from Sape to Labuan Bajp on Thursday leaving at 9am. You can buy the tickets beforehand at their ticket office in town."

And the people. I spent some nights there and was a bit sorry the hotel was full when I came back 4 months later. I had a very nice experience there. It!s a very quiet place, and just a short 5 min walk to the city. Icing on the cake: the day I left for Bali I got phone calls and SMS from the owners who found the iPod I had left in the safe of my bungalow... before I even knew I didn't have it with me. I had already landed in Denpasar then. They found a solution, and three days later I got my iPod back. MERCI!!"

"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","sasiki1","Bethesda MD USA","Romantic view","comfortable settings not luxurious, but the view from the deluxe room was breath taking. I would highly recommend this to anyone staying in Flores. Downtown is only a 15 minutes walk, and the sunsets here are just serene."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","pingishere","Singapore, Singapore","Absolutely Spectacular Views!","Ahhhh... The views are all stunning from the room, the restaurant and the pool. When I first did the research online, I thought that the photos must have been digitally enhanced? But the place is exactly what it looks like from the photos! The Deluxe room & its bathroom is spacious, comfortable and very clean. Our favorite part of the room must be porch, we spent hours on it - reading books, listening to music or just watching the sunset. Spectacular sunsets have become part of the routine during our 3 nights stay. WiFi connection is fast and strong. Air-conditioning and heater in the shower works very well. Fridge and electric kettle is provided in the room as well. Although there is not much variety on the restaurant menu (one page), the food is ok. For entertainment at night, there is a live band at the Paradise Bar & Restaurant. It's a nice place to chill and just 5 minutes walk downhill."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Robyn M","","Beautiful view and so clean!","We had a great stay at Golo Hilltop for 4 nights. Judith and Ingrid are really quick to respond by email and are very helpful once you arrive. We stayed 2 nights in the deluxe room (the best views!) And 2 in the standard room. Both were really clean and comfortable with good air con and the mini fridge which was a nice touch. The whole property was so clean, which we really appreciated after seeing some of the hygiene standards at other places in town. The food was decent but limited options. The pineapple pancakes were awesome. The view is the best in town, and the pool area is awesome for taking it it. We would stay here again in a heart beat."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","norfolknic","","fantastic view","Stayed one night only on a trip out to Komodo and Rinca. The location is stunning. the views amazing. Rooms large, clean and with good shower and balcony. Used pool only briefly in morning but what a setting,towels provided. Breakfast fine and we did have evening meal here as we were tired from our trip. Small menu but food was sufficient. Lovely gardens and flowers.Lots of steps so not for the less mobile. Some handrails could have been helpful. Not far into town if you did wish to go or as stated bar down hill nearby. A small but superbly located hotel with a fantastic view."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","mrotsmit","Austin","Excellent.","It seems that everything has already been covered here, all I can do is to add my enthusiastic agreement to all of the positive reviews!In regards to the walk into town (several earlier reviews mentioned this as a problem), I did this twice a day (sometimes at night) and it was no problem at all. A fifteen minute walk down (and back up) a moderate hill. The town itself, while not the most pristine (OK, it's ""third world""), is perfectly safe - the worst thing you'll likely experience is people asking ""Where are you going?"" which seemed to be the local way of offering assistance/starting up a friendly conversation."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Fiona L","Nottingham, United Kingdom","A little piece of paradise","Our stay here was brief but very enjoyable. The hotel consists of separate rooms arranged over the hillside with a main reception and cafe bar. It's quite a simple place but very well done, and for the price I don't think can be beaten. For me it's preferrable to a large hotel. We were collected from the airport and had a relaxing night before setting off for Komodo National Park. A short walk down the hill is Paradise Bar which is great for watching the sunset, and we enjoyed a lovely buffet. However, the walk back was pitch black! I'd definitely return and stay for longer."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Alibozza","","Absolutely stunning!!","I am not a sunbaking kind of person, but the pool and the views at the Golo Hilltop are what would make me come all the way back to this corner of the earth time and time again. The hotel is fairly simply, but it is clean, the beds are comfortable, the air-conditioning and fans work, the hot water is reliable, but most of all it has the most stunning views right from your bedroom window, and if that's not enough, every room has its own little balcony so you can sit and watch the sunset while drinking a bintang! We had died and gone to heaven and honestly didn't want to leave this place. At approx. $40aud per night (for air-conditioned room) we rated this as paradise. Don't be mislead though, this is not a typical 'resort' with room service and cocktails served by the poolside (or maybe it does - I didn't try!), it is more simple but like I said it's very clean and comfy. We used it for 2 singular night stays either side of our overnight boat trip to Komodo and Rinca Islands. Judith and Ingrid were extremely helpful in the lead-up to our stay helping with arrangements for our Komodo boat trip. Their service was outstanding, and I would definitely recommend people to stay here. It is about a 10 minute walk to town, perfect distance as it's not too far away, yet far away enough to have unspoilt views and less noise. Can't wait to go back!!"
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","marthiany","Dallas, Texas","With $30 per night I got $100 ocean view, spotlessly clean place and great hospitality!","If you'd prefer to stay in a high rise hotel building with room service, meeting rooms, big swimming pool, bar, this is not for you. Staying in Golo Hilltop is more like a stay in a friend's house on the top of the hill that has a BEAUTIFUL, well maintained garden with a small cozy swimming pool and amazing ocean view from your room, lobby, and everywhere. Very serene and calming. No loud music and people partying. I and husband booked this hotel only for 2 nights, because it was fully booked for 5 nights. All of the staff and the owner were very helpful and friendly. Even though this is not a 3 or 4 stars hotel but I was completely satisfied with my room(s). I stayed 1 night in a superior room and 1 night in the deluxe room. Both were great. Wi fi was smooth and fast in all over the places (swimming pool, lobby, room). Room was simple but very CLEAN -that is the most important for me- we got the hot water, shampoo, soap, towels, coffee maker and tea, safe box, plenty of hangers in the room as well. AC was working properly,which is very important in the HOT Flores. Breakfast was not abundant but the taste was pretty decent. Other food we ordered was pretty well made.The hotel location was actually quite close to the city. We took 10-15 minutes walk to buy groceries, eat in the Italian restaurant or local grill fish. You can even go to the dive shops in the city center to arrange your trip, if you want to have more choice. The good thing is even though it was walking distance to the city, we didn't get the city noise like other hotels in that area, because the location is a little bit 'hiding' on top of the hill. Perfect! I really cannot think of one bad thing from this place, really best value in Labuan Bajo... the best $30 I spent for a stay!"
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Ingri-ingri","Vancouver, Canada","Amazing view but could use more attention to detail","My fiance and I decided to stay at Golo Hilltop Hotel after reading all the great reviews and falling in love with the pictures posted online. When we got there, we weren't disappointed. It is truly a stunning view of the ocean and town of Labuan Bajo and we would probably return just for that view! However, there were a few small things about the hotel that added up in the end and made the stay less than ideal.When we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by a grunt from a man who we later found out was the manager, and he gestured us to our rooms without uttering a word, closing the door behind us. There was no information on the facilities, the town, or even a hello. We had read about the Dutch women who started the hotel, and we were looking forward to meeting them. However, we saw one of the Dutch women come and go from the pool and restaurant several times without a word to us. At one point, she just stared at us without a smile and turned away. She seemed to only talk to the Dutch guests in their own language. Perhaps she had a lot going on that day, although the hotel wasn't very busy, or maybe she had friends visiting, but to me, it just seemed like she was completely indifferent to whether we were there or not. We had dinner, breakfast, then lunch at the hotel and it was very mediocre. After tasting some very cheap and delicious food all over Indonesia, we were disappointed in the quality of the nasi goreng and fruit juices. The pineapple juice, especially, was so watered down that it tasted like flavoured water, and there's really no reason for this in such a fruitful tropical paradise. While we were having lunch, the manager came by and abruptly told us that we had to check out of the room at noon (in 10 minutes). Since nobody really talked to us during our stay, we didn't know what time check out was and we asked if we could extend it by 10-15 minutes. He said no. We went back to our room immediately to pack and by 12:05 the cleaning staff started banging on our door telling us we had to leave. This was a bit of unnecessary stress that we didn't need at the end of our trip. I think this hotel has a lot of potential and it has the best view in town, but the quality of service and attention to detail was lacking during our stay. We had a feeling that nobody was very enthusiastic about running the hotel or took pride in their work, and this definitely detracted from the experience for us. That being said, there is an amazing view, amazing pool, and unless another hotel is built next to this one, we would probably stay here again if we returned."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Barbie1976","Brighton, United Kingdom","Amazing views and fantastic service","We stayed at Golo Hilltop before a trip to Rinca and Komodo islands and then again before we commenced on a trip across Flores. The two Dutch owners (Judith and Ingrid) were incredibly helpful in emails prior to our arrival and it’s apparent that they run a very efficient ship! The hotel is absolutely gorgeous (in fact the pictures on their website don’t do it justice I feel). We stayed in one of the rooms at the top which had the most incredible views over the Bay – I swear I would never get bored of that view! The hotel is about 15 minute walk away from the centre of Labuanbajo but I preferred being that little bit out of town for the peace, quiet and amazing views. There is a lovely pool area and you can tell that the owners have put a lot of care and attention into the decor of the whole hotel. There is a small restaurant which again looks out over the bay. The menu is only small (we tended to eat in an evening just down the road in Paradise) but did have lunch when we arrived there and the food was of a very good standard. The breakfast menu is also small but again very tasty.We also booked our trip across Flores through Judith and Ingrid and our guide and driver were both excellent.Overall, Golo Hilltop is a fantastic place to stay in Labuanbajo and I also wouldn’t hesitate in recommending Judith and Ingrid for any requirements for touring Flores."

After reviewing a couple of hotels, we finally decided to stay here. And we never regret it. Although it is located almost in a remote place, but the view is spectacular! Back in 2012, the road was under construction, so there were so many gravels. And it was also dark at night. No lights or whatsoever. But that doesn't matter. The room was spacious and the bathroom was cleaned. There was not many breakfast choice, but it was good. The pool was also in a good condition. The water was clean. You will want to plunge in every time.The other good thing is, just 5 minutes from the hotel there was this bar, Paradise Bar & Restaurant. They also have stunning view directly to the sea. If the sky was clear, you will see a breathtaking sunset view that you will never forget for the rest of your life."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","TheAmusebouche","London","Excellent","This review is well overdue by a year and apologies are forthcoming. We stayed in February 2013.Amazing view, basic rooms and simple breakfast in the morning, but you don't mind when you have such a sumptious view. There is a swimming pool which has been recently installed, it's lovely (albeit baking in the sun). There is a lovely bar just down the road where you should definitely catch a sunset (Paradise Bar). Altogether, a great 2-3 days stopping station or Komodo Island etc. We had chosen this place over the new 4 star hotels which were offering amazing deals and we didn't regret it one bit!As a sidenote, we left a cuddly mascot in the bedroom. It's been travelling with us for a few years and whilst it might seem silly, we were devastated when we realised we had left it in the room. The Dutch ladies who run the Golo went well out of their way to reunite us. They sent someone to the airport with it but couldn't get through immigration (as we had just gone through). It was then after we had emailed, they sent it in a box to our new hotel and would't accept any more money for it. A small token, but a very welcome one and indicative of the great service of this place. THANKS!"
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","BeeDee_12","Delft, The Netherlands","That view, oh my!","Golo Hilltop is a simple but nice B&B run by two Dutch ladies. The rooms are quite spacious and also clean: nothing really fancy, but all the basics are there: AC, a small fridge, hot water, etc. However, the views you get from your room's veranda are what make this hotel truly shine: we could never get bored of watching the magnificent tropical bay of Lubuan Bajo. It gets even better when you look at it from the nice new pool they got built last year. Be sure to get a taste of the chicken nuggets they serve too: we thought them great!We also got our 2 day Komodo boat tour booked via Golo Hilltop in advance, which went quite smooth because the we got quick replies to our e-mails, The tour itself was a really great experience. Our guide, Jos(eph), was also a really nice guy, as was the crew of our boat.All in all we highly recommend this place and will definitely stay here again should we return to Flores and we would surely book trekkings via the guesthouse as well."

The restaurant menu is also very limited. Eggs or 1 pancake for breakfast and sandwiches and Indonesian basics for lunch or dinner. In Labuan Bajo you need to prioritize your requirements. Pick Golo for wifi and Luwansa for a nice room and good bed."

"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Flashpacker08","Singapore, Singapore","Oasis of Cleanliness","After having traveled for two weeks in Indonesia, it was a wonderful treat to stay at the Golo Hilltop Hotel. This place is the spot to stay if you want a fresh, tidy, well organized home. It was the first time we've seen someone come out and spray down and clean a table immediately after a guest has used the restaurant - the staff is trained well to keep the place spic and span. The room at the top is amazing - number 8. Incredible views and sunsets. Would suggest to improve - broaden the menu a bit more for dinner - while there are lots of restaurants in town, it's just nice to hang out in such a clean environment and have a great meal, with great views and not have to treck down town and end up needing another shower before bed. Second - perhaps don't put so much chlorine in the pool - perhaps we were there the day it was cleaned but the Chlorine was really too strong to enjoy the pool, though the pool was spotless on that day. Finally, as others have mentioned a little more generous breakfast would be greatly appreciated... one pancake or a small helping of eggs is hard to hold one over when you're going to venture out for the day. Include juice - it's only $1.50 usd more, but would leave a lasting impression.Loved the two day, one night boat tour we were set up on - while expensive, you get what you pay for, and our guide Lexi was fantastic, the food on the boat was plentiful, and the snorkeling amazing... didn't even need to dive to see the mantas. Overall it was a great place, Judith was a gracious host, so friendly... and super responsive on emails coordinating everything. Thanks for making our trip great! We'll be back!"

"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","gringa220","Washington DC, USA","Beautiful view, nice hotel and service","We stayed twice before and after a diving liveaboard. Our first stay was excellent - we were in one of the top rooms and had a breathtaking view from our balcony. Our second stay, we were in the furthest room on the bottom, so we heard road noise and the wi-fi didn't work. Despite the two different types of rooms, they're all very spacious and impeccably clean, in fact, very similar in standard. The main reason to stay here: the view, the view, the view. Everything else is a cherry on top. There's nothing better than the view while relaxing at the pool - literally one of the most lovely places to relax ever. We really enjoyed full mornings or afternoons at the pool. It's a bit of a walk into town, but they can also call cheap taxis to take you down. The restaurant is good with a basic menu. Everything we had was tasty and the dining room was a nice place to spend the evening surfing the internet with a beer. It does get a bit hectic at dinner time and the receptionist/waiter is quite busy. We enjoyed this friendly place and think it's perfect for Labuan Bajo. Recommend!"
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","africat544","Cairo","A really friendly place","The owner helped us to organize an excellent cruise to Komodo National Park and was extremely accommodating of our needs. As the other reviews indicate, the hotel is not fancy, but clean and comfortable with great views over the harbour and a very nice atmosphere. Walking to town is easy during the day since you're going downhill. It's not a difficult walk uphill but the heat may sap your energy. At night, it's rather dark to feel comfortable walking with traffic coming around the road bends at times. Ojaks (motorcycle taxis) are easy to get from town at night. A little gem of a place."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Dr_Igor_1971","Volgograd, Russia","Ranking #1 is completely justified","Golo Hilltop is a small Boutique Style hotel with stunning ocean views, quiet serenity and pleasant family atmosphere. Judith and Ingrid are two very friendly Dutch women who run the place very well indeed. Golo is situated on top of a hill about 1 km from the city centre, this makes it a quiet and relaxing place but everything is still on walkable distance (15 minutes to the center of Labuan Bajo, 20-25 minutes back because of the hill).The hotel is well managed and all the staff seems very good. The rooms, like the hotel are nothing fancy but the beds are comfortable, come with a fan, good air con and a mosquito net. There are stairs to hotel and a variety of levels of stairs to different rooms. Our deluxe room (#7) was in the far top right corner of the property. Each room has a little porch which is great to sit out on and enjoy the view. The pool (also with a view and with additional towels) is very clean and comfortable.The breakfast was simple yet tasty. The pineapple pancakes were especially good. Ingrid advised us to visit Paradise Bar & Restaurant and buffet dinner with fresh grilled Barracuda was simply delicious (15.01.2014).Judith and Ingrid were always available to help and advice. They were so kind to arrange our accommodation in Kanawa Island Resort and transfer from the airport to Kanawa Resort office in Labuan Bajo. It was helpful as our flight was slightly delayed and we really afraid of being late. The hotel charges you one way transport pick up 50,000 IDR. Same charge applies from hotel to airport.Golo is a nice oasis in Labuan Bajo and was by far the best value place to stay. We paid 550,000.00 IDR per night for a deluxe triple room (inclusive TAX and service charge). Ranking #1 is completely justified. No hesitations in recommending it."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","BritishGuru","Surabaya, Indonesia","Perfect Hotel","This hotel is stunning. Superbly managed and extremely well organised. Rooms at the bottom have recently been refurbished so there is AC and fan in each and windows straight out to gorgeous view of the bay. Nice little touches are appreciated. For example - coffee comes in ""filter pots"" - the ones with a plunger so you don't get gloopy goo at the bottom of the cup like you do in other places around these beautiful isles. There was always enough milk for coffee and for giving a glass to the children. Bread was fresh, always enough towels etc. This place is top notch and managed by professionals who know what a tourist / guest / visitor needs and wants. Customer is first. Stunning views, lovely clean rooms, help when you need it but no hassle. Professional local manager in restaurant. We loved this place and Labuan Bajo. Go quickly before the whole island is brought up by Italians !!!!!"
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Rashidah Z","","great view of the bay, worth every penny","We stayed here for two nights and both nights were fantastic. For breakfast, the bread rolls were soft and tasty (and I found out later it was homemade). The restaurant overlooks the bay so you definitely will take your time eating and enjoying the scenery. The two owners were fantastic..they helped us with so many things like calling an angkot (mini taxi) for us to get around and suggesting alternative hotels when we wanted to stay an extra night but they were full.The rooms were super clean and nicely decorated. The bathroom was rather spacious which was something I enjoyed since for the past few days, we were staying at dirtier and smaller hotels.The location of the hotel is away from the city center which is great because I feel the city center is a little bit seedy and unpleasant. But you can actually take a slow 15-20 minute walk down if you wanted. You can also rent a motorbike from the hotel if there are still some available.Overall, I definitely suggest staying here if you are making a trip to Labuan Bajo. It is worth very single cent and the service here is excellent."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Marius K","Budapest, Hungary","Beautiful Place and View Overlooking the Labuan Bajo Bay","As part of our four week Indonesia vacation, we stayed at Golo Hilltop first for two nights in a Deluxe Room, then went on a trip to Komodo and Rinca, and returned for another night at Golo (this time in a Superior Room). The prearranged transfer from the airport went smoothly. It is a very beautiful, clean and well run place, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay there.Golo Hilltop is slightly above the town of Labuan Bajo, whose center can easily be reached on foot (around 15 minutes). The property is situated on the hill slope and stretches across about three levels. On the ground level (still somewhat elevated from the street) is the Restaurant and the pool area, as well as a few superior rooms. The other rooms are a few stairs up. Our deluxe room was in the far top right corner of the property, which gave us beautiful views and privacy.The place is run by two Dutch women, Judith and Ingrid. On the day of our arrival, they were busy renovating some rooms. We were slightly irritated at first that they didn't come to greet us or even acknowledged us as they passed our restaurant table, even though we had exchanged a number of friendly e-mails in the previous days. In the end, though, we met them and they are indeed two very charming ladies. The room rate included a breakfast, which was decent (the pineapple pancakes were especially good). There is also the option to have lunch or dinner; the offer is standard Indonesian fare.For our planned trip to Komodo and Rinca, we first got an offer from one of the hotel employees. This being quite overpriced, however (I believe it would have been 3 mio rupiah for 2 days/1 night), we decided to book the trip through one of the travel shops in town. Overall we had a very lovely stay in a modest but very comfortable hotel. Most of all we enjoyed the cool breeze from the see while reading and relaxing on our room terrace.Thanks Judith and Ingrid, and see you next time we pass by Labuan Bajo!Rahel and Marius"

The view from our chalet was extraordinary- full panorama of the smaller bay at LB. Food was great- we ate regularly 'in house', and the staff were brilliant (Sam, Peter, and of course our hosts Ingrid and Judith). Oh, the pool- the pool is ace for cooling down with a beer after trekking back up to Golo hilltop. Great value for money. Fantastic place- we will certainly stay there again when we return to Flores. Great- Thanks!."

Their response on emails is amazingly quick!We opted for the deluxe room on the upmost top of the hill offering beautiful views (causes one to climb some more steps) which is in fact 1/2 of a double bungalow. The room is very spacious and spotlessly clean, the bathroom fulfills european standards.At the moment there is some renovation going on at 2 of the standard rooms out of 10 rooms at all.Walking down to the main road with shops and restaurants takes about 10 to 15 minutes, a bemo will bring you back up for 25.000Right now there is a building site for the all new international airport close to the old one, should be ready for operation in june 2014 (maybe)"

The staff were very friendly, rooms were clean, breakfast was adequate. Very helpful in arranging transfers. It is a walk down and then back up, the hill into the main part of town. I rented a scooter for the length of my stay. However, the view is spectacular and the pool is a great place to sit, relax and swim :)"
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","FreekAmsterdam","Amsterdam, The Netherlands","I had expected more","What I liked about the location was the view from the hill, the place has a very nice view and the friendly staff and owners.What I disliked where the enormous amounts of mosquitos in the room, the noise from the (temporary construction works), the old-fashioned design of the rooms, the distance from Labuan Bajo, especially if you go diving in the morning, and the fact that you needed to pay extra to get a juice with your breakfast."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","IMH-Rdam","Rotterdam","Nice, but could be a lot more","We stayed here after a 3-night liveaboard. I was a bit in doubt whether I should be giving this accomodation three or four stars, but settled on 3. Let me start by mentioning the good things:- the location is absolutely beautiful. The view over the Labuan Bajo bay is breathtaking- prices, if you consider location, are good- rooms were clean- swimming pool + view is great Then some of the negatives:- it seems quite a walk from Labuan Bajo- the owners did not teach their staff to be service oriented. We arrived around 8 PM in the evening and although we did get a key from reception, we had to carry our luggage up the (many!) stairs by ourselves. I am fine with carrying my own backpack, but hey, some help should be offered if you are in a hotel (it was the same story when leaving)! In addition, we didnt get any help (maps, etc) when we were going down to the village by bike leading to us getting lost a couple of times that night- rooms are very simple and I didnt like the design, very 90's. - the only place in Indonesia where we didnt get free fruit juice at breakfast. I had to pay extra when I wanted mixed juice in addition to my coffee. I mean, really? Same held for the fact that we rented a scooter for 1 day plus about 2 hours and we had to pay extra for those two hours. Exemplary Dutch behaviour ;) (saying this as a Dutch person myself)"
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Tagsalong","Stockport, United Kingdom","Beautiful views for a one night stay","Having stayed here on 26th December and reading the review of somebody who arrived three days later I consider myself very lucky indeed. I found the hotel totally adequate for an overnight stay. Yes, Labuan Bajo is not a town you could admire but is a gateway to Komodo. We walked to the town and back in total darkness but did not feel frightened and a friendly local stopped and gave us a lift into town as we had walked the wrong way from the hotel. The owners of Golo were away but we were greeted and shown to our room which was clean, bright and had a safe for valuables. Fortunately I did not see more than the odd flying insect in the room and we were protected by mosquito nets. We had fabulous weather in which to enjoy a swim, overlooking views which I consider second to none. The overnight boat trip to Rinka and Komodo, arranged by Golo, was fabulous, enhanced by two days of non stop sunshine and a sea like a millpond. Food at Golo Hilltop was basic but again adequate, fresh and .....that view!"
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","JeffyZeFrench","Bunbury, Australia","Disappointed","All the email exchanges I've had with Ingrid and Judith (the owners) prior booking and prior coming to Labuan Bajo were perfect and they organised Airport transfer for us too.We initially planned to stay 4 nights, we ended up staying only 1 night.The main reason was because of the weather. Constant rain, even the locals were saying ""all it does is rain"" so we didn't the adventure on a boat and missed out on the dragons. I don't think the conditions were good enough to enjoy the adventure.Golo Hilltop has an amazing view from any room! It is really beautifully located!The swimming pool looked nice too.Is it located only 10min walk from the city center of Labuan Bajo as most people say? It didn't look that close to me! I would bet more on 20min going downhill and 30-35min coming back! But we didn't walk out of the hotel so I can't say for sure. And honestly, I don't think I would walk out of the hotel anyway. The streets look creepy and dangerous so are the people living in Labuan Bajo.I was expecting the room to be simple but not THAT simple. It was depressing to look at it. We clearly didn't want to spend Christmas in a dump like Labuan Bajo!Not even a small TV or a radio.Cockroaches in the supposedly clean towels.Spiders and other bugs all day and night inside the room.The bed is like sleeping in jail.Dead mosquitoes still on the supposedly clean glasses in the bathroom.Thank God it has an aircon and hot water in the shower!I found the food surprisingly good, my partner hated it and got sick from it.Not that surprising, we could hear the cook coughing, sneezing and spitting in the kitchen.I think the worst experience was when the Indonesian at the reception organised the return transfer to the airport. It was nowhere near what we had to come to the hotel.He organised this dodgy Indonesian man, obviously nicknamed ""Casanova"" as his disgusting van said on its side. The ""Casanova Van"" has about 20 mirrors on the dashboard and above the windscreen, some strange bars attached to the ceiling of the van and a ""I will miss you"" sticker on the dash and the sliding door didn't close.This was the creepiest experience of our life. I do not know what happens in this van and I actually don't want to know.I don't think I need to mention we were relieved to finally see the airport after ""Casanova"" drove us everywhere around the creepiest sides of Labuan Bajo as we clearly took a way longer way to get back to the airport than the way we took to get to the hotel.The hotel said it would cost IDR35.000, Casanova asked for IDR50.000. For an extra $1.5, I didn't discuss anything, I just wanted to leave this creepy guy and his dirty van!I believe this was a nasty joke from the reception guy just because we made our stay shorter than expected.He was also clearly making fun of us in Indonesian during diner to some other Indonesians and Westerners who understood the language. We may not understand Indonesian but like anyone else, we know when someone makes fun of us.The choice of alcohol was limited to Bintang and... Bintang. Yep, that's it! No wine, no Smirnoff, nothing but Bintang!Ingrid and Judith were on holidays and I will put this bad mark on the lack of having managers running the place. But this experience was clearly unacceptable!Would I come back to Labuan Bajo? Yes, in a different time of the year as I really want to see the dragons.Would I stay again at Golo Hilltop? Maybe yes, as I actually don't believe I could find any better in Labuan Bajo. Maybe not, because it is far from town and if I want to bargain tours, it is not ideal as the walk seems long and scary."

We stayed for one night before a 3 day liveaboard and loved it. We would have stayed on the back-end of the diving trip but unfortunately it was booked. Golo is situated up a hill about a 5 minute drive from town and it is nice to have a gorgeous view and a nice and quite place. The pool is fabulous and you can get food and drinks served right there. The whole property is extremely well taken care of and is beautiful. Each room has a little porch which is great to sit out on and read / enjoy the view. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful with taxis, etc. The room was clean and the bathroom was as well - also AC which is a must! The wifi worked well when we were there so I believe they have resolved any previous issues. The food was good enough too that you didn't have to head into town unless you wanted to. Highly recommend!!!"

Quite a shock compared to all other places we have stayed at in Indonesia, with very warm welcome and advise on what to do. When we asked the staff, the advice was rather poor. After 2 days we finally managed to meet the hosts and they are very friendly and helpful, so this made up for the rest a bit.The ambience with other guests was not too great neither.

"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","brockin07","New York City, New York","Good for a day off","This is a lovely little hotel on the hill overlooking a bay. It’s up a hill going away from town so if you’re planning on heading out to go diving every day or take trips out to the islands, this hotel isn’t for you. You’ll find the trek to and from town annoying and it costs a dollar each way on the back of a motorbike. The walk is only 5-15 minutes depending on where in town you want to go. However, if you are looking for a day or two of relaxation with a nice view, then Golo Hilltop is probably your best bet. The views from the top rooms are spectacular and each has a little balcony with chairs. There is also a nice little pool overlooking the ocean where you can relax.The rooms aren’t luxurious, but they are basic and clean with hot water and AC or a fan, depending on your room selection. Their pillows could use a bit of improvement. I stayed in both a deluxe room at the top of the hill and in a lower level room on the same floor as the reception. I would highly recommend staying in the top level rooms, otherwise the price and location really isn’t worth your time. The staff here were helpful and the included breakfast was quite good. I think they must make fresh rolls each morning, and breakfast is served with French press coffee. Yum! However, you can stay in an equally comfortable hotel for half the price (and also half the charm and with no view) in town. Something to consider."

However, you don't normally have to wait long before a motorbike taxi will be along to whisk you up the hill.I stayed in one of the cheaper rooms which was large but pretty basic although it did have an in room safe. The room was clean and tidy with a large mosquito net over the bed. Bathroom was also fairly basic but hot water at good pressure was available and well required!Nice area at the front of the room with table and chairs and a drying area.Very pleasant bar/reception/restaurant area mainly open to the elements.

It has a lovely, if small pool,a restaurant serving good if limited food, wi-fi in the restaurant, helpful staff who speak good English and spectacular views over the bay. The rooms, like the hotel are nothing fancy but the beds are comfortable, come with a fan, good air con and a mosquito net. The hotel was also located by, and a 5 minute walk from, perhaps the best bar in the whole town - the reggae bar which did great food and had a terrific party vibe and was a real draw for everyone in the town - fortunate really as I don't imagine there are more than 2-3 bars in the whole of Labuan Bajo - to say the town is developing and remote is an understatement to say the least! It was also perhaps no further than 10 minutes from the airport which again was a touch."

Restaurant offers a modest choice of good quality food for Indonesian (low) prices. The rooms are simple but spacious and clean, the bed is quite firm. A real good place, as you already gathered from the other reviews.Hotel terrain is a bit steep, which enables the stunning views, which makes hotel less suitable for those having difficulty taking challenging stairways.

Judith and Ingrid have been busy remodeling the pool, restaurant and the grounds, all of which are charming. We stayed in a couple of the older rooms, but Judith told me they are going to begin remodeling those this fall. Best of all, the price was right!

It is a short walk from the centre of town yet they can arrange a bemo for you, a ride up the hill costs around 10k. All rooms have a sea view which is great for watching the sunset.

You are a fair walk away from the town here, although bemos or motorbikes are always around. The views are fantastic and the pool is a great place to take them in. The room was basic but clean with aircon, a safe and a good bed. Fantastic garden - check out the huge leafy plants next to the pool. Didn't try the food here, but there was a bar (Paradise I think) just down the road that served a decent chicken sate. Have to say that I wasn't too impressed with Labuan Bajo itself as a town, but I guess most people come here to go diving or exploring rather than stay there."

"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Thetravalier","Los Angeles, California","Great view but very overpriced for the room quality","There is no denying that the view from this hotel is fantastic, but I was severely disappointed with the quality of the rooms. I had just come from Ubud where I paid $50 for a 4-5* experience. I paid $45 per night at Golo so I was expecting something good, especially as the last time I had been to Labuanbajo I had been paying $2 a night. I was really surprised at just how basic the room was for this price. Everything was old and had obviously been used a lot. I had wanted to stay 3 nights but they were full so luckily for me I went elsewhere after the first night as I didn't want to stay here. The owners didn't seem to be that helpful even though I had read rave reviews about them, but one of the guys who worked there helped me a bit. Be careful of the scam going on for trips to Rinca island. They say they work together with the other hotels and tourist offices so they can group people together and make it cheaper for you, but apparently when I was there no one else wanted to go on a trip so I would have to pay $120 for a private trip. Finally, they heard about another woman wanting to go so we shared the cost. On the day we did the trip though, there were at least 5 other boats doing the same trip from LB with only 2 people on each boat, so there are always others out there. I would suggest chatting to people you see to find out if they are doing a trip."

Rooms are basic but have got hot water,soap and shampoo provide, air conditioning, good beds and that is all we require. No fridge in the room but the beer and soft drinks are cheap enough to buy from the hotel. The meals are fine but don't expect 5 star cuisine what would be impossible to find any way in this area. Internet available. The pool of course was great and magnificent views. We organised a boat through the Hotel and they have the contacts so don't bother organizing any thing your self as we took a boat trip to Rinca to see the Komodo dragons and had a snorkel at one of the islands what was great including the lunch provided what I did not expect much of but was one of the best of our holiday. Would come back if we would ever come back this way and will tell everybody I know about this undiscovered part of Indonesia. I have rated this Excellent based on the price and my comments above."

The gardens were really colourful and the whole place felt 'loved'.We only stayed one night in transit between the inland of Flores and returning to Bali so the setting up the steep hill was really nice and we weren't concerned about being a fair way from the town.

Would come back any time, be it on my own, be it as a couple, be it with friends!"

"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Bernd_Huijser63","Houten, The Netherlands","The homely ambience with a hotel service","If you go for the impersonal (standard) middle class hotel service of an Indonesian hotel, please book on of the big hotel on the other side of Labuhan Bajo. If you go for a friendly and homely ambience and still well equiped and spotlessly clean rooms, than this is the place to be. All rooms have airco, hot water and are nicely decorated. The bed linnen is ajusted to the colours in the room and was different each time I stayed here. The service of the staff is personal, warm and friendly. The hotel can arrange all kinds of trips around town or elsewhere on the island. The management is European, which explains the efficiency and the cleanness (both at European standards). And since the number of bungalows is limited, the place is quiet. All rooms have a verandah with a beautiful seaview. If you can spend a bit more, go for the upper rooms. They are newer, a bit larger, but the main difference for me were the better view and private verandahs. The view from the pool, the great deckchairs and provided towels are hard to beat by any other hotel of this class and prize."

The pool is great, and the view from it, or from your room is stunning. Sunsets are pure magic. It's not in the centre of town, which for us was great. Labuan Bajo is too noisy compared to how interesting it is, so a little out of the way is perfet. We rented a motorbike at the hotel and went were we wanted to go. Easy.Only minus is that the food is quite bland."

Not only does this hotel have excellent rooms & views, the staff made everything easy for us. We stayed in the superior rooms & it was large, clean, great air-conditioning, great shower & good internet. The view & sunset was amazing.

The hotel is beautiful with a billion dollar view, beautiful garden and great pool to relax. Room was good and clean and the sunset was just magnificent. We booked all our tours with them and tours were organized perfectly. Everything went smoothly, the guide was great. Ingrid was so helpful and went an extra mile for us to be on time at the airport (transuna flight was resheduled to an early hour and we would have missed the flight if she hadn't notice us).Great plase to stay with very helpful and friendly people. Highly recommended."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","ParisTraveller17","Paris","Easily the best place to stay in Flores, very clean nice budget accommodation; 3 star price, 5 star view & pool","It seems that there is very little decent budget accommodation in Flores (based on Tripadvisor, guidebooks, and chatting with locals and people we met when we arrived). The budget places are hit & miss in terms of cleanliness and security for your stuff. Advance-bookings can be unreliable, and service poor. You might be lucky and have an ok stay in one of them, but then you might not. We managed to get 2 nights at Golo Hilltop, and found it a really amazing place to stay. It’s worth making sure you stay one night there just for the view! It’s really clean, and the service is good.But it does get booked up in advance (by Indonesian travel agencies “because tourists like it” as one agent told me). We contacted them nearly 2 weeks in advance and it was already too late to get the dates we wanted or any 3 consecutive nights in the window we had, so make sure you reserve as far in advance as you can in popular months (we were there in June) if you want to stay here. I loved it because it was a perfect compromise of maintaining a budget price (we are backpacking, so cannot go any higher than this) for quite simple accommodation, but doing it really well (very clean which is really something in Indonesia!, safety box, nice breakfast, very friendly and efficient local staff, nice bathroom with hot & cold water and everything worked), with the added bonus of a stunning view – Labuan Bajo turquoise bay sprinkled with boats and hilly islands, sunsets on the horizon - and being able to spend an afternoon by the swimming pool, surrounded by flowers, looking out over the bay…. We paid approx. $33 for a very clean standard room, fan-only, with private bathroom, free tea & coffee making facilities, outside area with a table and chairs, space to dry your clothes, an amazing view, free good wifi in the restaurant area that you can sit in for as long as you want (but no wifi in the rooms), free drinking water, and a very nice light breakfast included: tea, coffee and tropical fruit, with a choice of fruit pancake, or egg any style with 2 freshly home-baked rolls and amazing homemade jam. The portion was quite small (as is the case most of the time in Asia), but the quality high. You can pay more to have AC (available in all rooms – they just don’t give you the remote control if you pay the cheaper fan-only rate), and to have more “deluxe” rooms, but I did not ask details on what made them more deluxe…I liked their environmentally-friendly approach of encouraging visitors to fill up their water bottles from the big container rather than generate plastic waste, and similarly they had containers to distribute the soap/shampoo in the bathrooms rather than the little mini plastic bottles. They also had mosquito net curtains that you could use around the bed if you wanted to which was great. There were not many mosquitos compared to other places, but I appreciated having this option available and I used it one night when we had a mosquito in the room.Golo Hilltop is, as the name suggests, on top of a hill, above the town. For us it was only a 20min walk down to the town, and was really not a problem, even when we walked down early one day to meet our boatman at 7am for a trip. It was a great compromise because not too far away from town, but really quiet, escaping from the noise below. (After a month and a half in Indonesia I can say that the main road of Labuan Bajo is particularly noisy, - we did stay there one night - and unless you absolutely need to be in the centre, I would avoid it). At night it would be dark and you would need a torch, but we never did the walk in the dark in the end. We ate early in town, and then walked back up around 6, 6.30am watching the sunset. If you are not happy with the walk the hotel can organize you an AC taxi for 50 000 Rp or a local bemo for 25 000 Rp to drop you in town. Airport pick-up is offered by the hotel for 50 000Rp (AC taxi) which we used and it worked very well. They offer boat trips organized by the hotel to Rinca + snorkelling which are no doubt very good quality and very good for holiday-makers, but were too much for our budget (150 000 000 Rp in total for the boat trip excluding the Komodo national park and guide fees) and because most of the other guests were package and so already had their trips organized we could not share the cost with anyone, so we found a cheaper trip at the local agencies in town. (PS They are not very organized in Labuan Bajo to group tourists together so expect to have to pay for a boat for yourself or just your couple, unless you manage to find people and make a group yourself. We went to 3 little local agencies in the main street to ask questions & compare prices before deciding, and in the end we bought our trip from Lois (tel: 081 239 383 464) at 5pm for 7am the next morning. He had the cheapest price (700 000Rp for the boat including simple, nice Indonesian rice lunchbox, water, tea & coffee and bananas for snacks on the boat, snorkelling gear), and we had a feeling he was honest, and he did prove to be honest & reliable. We made a deal with him that we could check the life jackets & seaworthiness of the boat in the morning before we confirmed the deal or paid for anything, and he agreed. He met us at the jetty the next day to confirm and to introduce the boatman Matmur, who was very friendly and did the job well (with basic English for your basic needs but not enough to chat), the life jackets were in great shape and the boat was fine – everything was as described. The Rinca fee was actually made up of lots of little fees: we paid 320 000 Rp in total for a couple (20 000Rp per person entrance fee, you get your own mandatory guide for 80 000Rp, 50 000Rp per camera, 50 000Rp for your boat parking fee, Komodo National Park ticket 30 000Rp per person, and about 20 000 per person in various taxes…)"

A perfect place to relax in beautiful surroundings - stunning view especially at sunset, & gorgeous gardens around all the rooms. The pool is great - & is open to the amazing view! Ingrid and Judith were both very welcoming & helpful.Our room was clean with good aircon, & a thoughtfully placed folder of helpful information.I would suggest considering eating elsewhere in the evenings - even though the view is great, as the selection & quality of the food is not quite up to the standard of everything else here. Grab a bintang while the sun sets, then wander down into town for a meal (only 5 minute walk)."

Ingrid and her business partner were incredibly helpful, and very friendly. The views from their place are incredible, and there's a perfect little pool to relax next to and a small, open restaurant. The rooms were decent - could use some upgrades in terms of sheets/towels/bed comfort, but totally passable. The view made it all worthwhile."

The rooms were spacious, bright and clean and the bed comfy. Sleep was easy as it was nice and quiet. The view from the room was like nothing else, even the room on the lower level. Food was tasty but if you want a change it is a short walk down the road to Paradise Restaurant but a longer trek into town. The owners were very helpful arranging onwards travel, motorbike rental is available and they also will provide maps. The staff were very friendly and attentive. Pool is beautiful and clean and poolside service is available (my only suggestion would be to add cocktails to the list :p). Free wifi available and also a massage service that comes to your room.

"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Sven86","Munich, Germany","more hostel than hotel","We stayed at Golo Hilltop for only one night. Since we booked a Deluxe Room, we were quite disappointed from the standard of the room and especially the bathroom. The location is beautiful and the view is breathtaking, the breakfast area and the pool side are nice. However, compared to other hotels in Labuan Bajo, the price is a little bit too high. In the evening, we had dinner at Paradise Bar, which is very close to the hotel. There you can enjoy a very nice dinner including a beautiful sunset!We booked a two days boat trip with a guide to Komodo and Rinca Island via the hotel which was very disappointing. The boat was horrible, everything was dirty and sticky (even the beds), and the guide was not worth its money. All together, this boat trip was extremely overpriced (130€ pp). We thought we would get a really nice trip for that huge amount of money. If you plan to visit Komodo and Rinca, go by day trips and don't book via Golo Hilltop!"
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Baligirl11","","Ah Golo! Truly fantastic!","Stayed here recently at the beginning and end of a Flores road trip. We could not have asked for more. It's location is stunning and the view at sunset and sunrise takes your breath away. Pool and surrounds are exactly what you need to relax. Free wifi works well in the restaurant and the more expensive rooms. We ate at the restaurant both nights and enjoyed it. The menu is varied - including some old favorites but also a range of local dishes.The owners and staff do everything they can to help you - storing luggage and taking care of laundry. Highly recommended. Stay at the 5 star places if you want the soulless experience common in such establishments but head to Golo if you want to enjoy the spectacular view of Labuan Bajo."

We were recommended Golo hilltop and were not disappointed when we got there. Unfortunately we could only stay one night as they were fairly booked up. The room was reasonably priced for Labuan Bajo and had one of the more comfortable beds we had stayed on during the trip. The showers worked well and the hotels restaurant served great food at a decent price. The pool was a perfect place for my gf to wind the day away reading and enjoying the amazing view from the hilltop where the hotel was situated whilst I went off on my dive trip. The staff were extremely friendly and the owner was very helpful on telling us about the area and seemed to be happy to sit down and have a quick chinwag.

The location is amazing on top of the hill overlooking the sea and the gardens are beautiful. The room was exactly what we needed - comfortable bed, powerful hot shower, amazing view. Breakfast was very tasty and relaxing by the pool in the middle of the hot afternoon was very welcome. Walking into town is really not that strenuous - it is all downhill and it is easy to get a taxi (van or scooter) to bring you back. As in many places off the beaten track having a torch is a good idea though so that people can see you on the road.If you stay here you MUST go for a massage nearby at Yayasan Ayo Mandiri where all the treatments are provided by blind, visually impaired or deaf therapists. Simply amazing.Golo Hilltop is great value and highly recommended."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","trvlbufElmhurst","Elmhurst, Illinois","Adequate choice for a short trip to see the Komodo...","The Golo is a small, clean, no frills hotel with spetacular views of Labuan Bajo Bay. It is an adequate choice for a short trip to Rinca to visit the Komodo National Park. My husband and I stayed two nights and it was enough time. Ingrid and Judith are wonderful hosts. They booked our day boat trip to the island of Rinca. The boat trip included two stops for snorkeling, snorkeling gear, towels, lunch in the boat and tea/coffee/water during the trip. Enjoyable! The waters around the islands are very clear but we were surprised to see a lot of garbage/trash all over...what a pity as the area could be really amazing. We really hope that the authorities take action before it is too late. We noticed the same thing in the bay in Labuan Bajo, plastic bags, cups, wrappers...floating on the water. The Golo has a small swimming pool with a few chaise loungers and umbrellas. The views from the restaurant, the pool and the rooms are unforgettable and worth the stay. The breakfast was adequate and freshly prepared. We ate in town on our first evening but the walk there is not for the faint of heart. There are no taxis into or out of town at night. The only way is either walking (which we chose) or riding in the back of a motorbike, for a dollar or two. The country road is poorly lighted!! We did it once and decided to stay at the Golo the following night. The food was good and reasonably priced. We definitely recommend staying in. In our opinion, it is a good idea to book your airport transfers with Judith and Ingrid. That way your arrival and departure is worry free. The same applies to the excursions. They will book and arrange everything for you. We stayed at their deluxe rooms and it was a good choice."

We had a deluxe room which was clean, quite large and with very efficient a/c. They were very accommodating with our 2 children, putting in extra beds for us. Beautiful views from the terrace and the pool was lovely. Everything was really well organised - our pick ups and drop offs were always on time. The trips organised by the local employee at the hotel were excellent. We went to see the Komodo Dragons from here on Rinca Island (a 2 1/2 hour boat trip) and beautiful islands with fantastic snorkelling."

Will stay there again if I go to Labuan Bajo..Going there is cheap, with ""ojek"" motorcycle only Rp. 5.000,- to get around everywhere in the city.

Upgraded and stayed in one of the cabins higher up with better view and AC this time, and it was worth the extra cost.Better than last time, better wifi and the road up to the hotel was asphalted. Still good, the view of the ocean and sunsets, the swimming pool, the garden, owners and staff, food and that it is out of the centre and are quite from scooter noise."

I chose the basic room which really is basic but does the job. I would suggest that you pay the extra and use the air-con as during the night it is just far too hot. Breakfast is nice, but is limited and small portions. The views are amazing and it is a 15-20 minute walk into the centre of town. I would suggest avoid walking to town during the day as it is very hot and instead get a taxi! staff at the hotel are friendly and I was even given a lift by a member of staff to the camera shop on the other side of town when he had just finished work, which was very kind of him! The pool is nice. My overall stay at this hotel was fine, although I found the price alittle steep!"

I remember seeing Golo Hilltop mentioned in the Lonely Planet and asked him if there were any rooms availabe, I got the last one.Leo took me to the hotel on the back of his scooter (i had a choice to go in the van but scooters are much more fun) and on arrival ingrid, one of the owners, welcomed me warmly and shook my hand. Leo explained that the room i had was the most expensive as it was the highest room with the best views and that i could move to a cheaper room for my second night if i wanted to. He was not kidding about the views, they were stunning!! I felt like i had walked in to some kind of famous lifestyle, it was pretty sureal and for £30 a night it was amazing value for money.I wanted to do a day trip to see the komodos and after checking in to my room Leo sat down with me and went through all the options, he sorted the boat out for me and took me to get all the equipment i would need, i couldnt have asked for better service.By the end of my 2 day stay i was sad to leave as i felt like i had made friends with some of the staff and wish i had stayed there at least another day.

Not only is the hotel very nice, but they also arranged a three day / two night Komodo Live-aboard trip that was super! More on that at the bottom of the review.Highlights of hotel: Spectacular views, great pool, great service. Expat owners and local staff friendly and helpful.The food (breakfast twice and dinner once) was good. Not award winning, but certainly good enough, and with a wide choice of meals and drinks.The rooms themselves are nothing special, but we knew that going in so it wasn’t a let down. With the pool and the views, the only thing you really want to do in the room anyways is sleep. Bed was very comfortable, air conditioner worked well, and water pressure was good.Overall, an excellent experience and great value. Would return in a heartbeat.As for the boat trip, they arranged a three day / two night boat trip to Komodo and Rinca Islands, which included 4-5 stops for snorkeling and two treks through the parks to see Komodo Dragons and a variety of birds. The experience was fantastic, although there were a few mishaps that I don’t blame on Golo Hilltop (e.g. broken refrigerator on board = warm beer and soda on trip). I will soon leave a longer TripAdvisor Forum post on our Komodo boat experience, and what to look out for."

"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","DresdeDean","Frankfurt, Germany","Unexpected Tranquility","Every once in a while I have the good fortune to come across a hotel or a restaurant that offers unexpected quality. My wife and I do a lot of traveling in Asia and we've come to understand that service standards are not all equal. So, when I checked into the Golo Hilltop Hotel for my short stay, my expectations were muted. However, what emerged was quite likely one of the best hotel's I have ever stayed in. The Golo Hilltop is not a 5-star lux hotel. It is not some glitzy granite edifice designed to make you feel like you possess a level of class and distinction that in reality you don't. Neither does it offer dry cleaning and laundry at your door, or the latest fusion cuisine from some chef I've never heard of... what is does offer is stunning views, quiet relaxation, friendly hospitality from the owners and staff, and the feeling that I've stumbled on something very special and unique. Strangely, it all feels quite accidental to me. This place makes me feel like I don’t have to try to be anyone, or be anything. The Golo Hilltop definitely has an island-style vibe going on, not artificially put on; it just is. The location of the place is part of its charm. It is, as the name suggests, located on a hill, which provides for the stunning views. It is located a leisurely 15 minute walk from the center of Labuan Bajo town, all of it down hill. Walking back is doable, but a very cheap system of transport exists here that will aid in your return trip to the hotel if walking up hill does not appeal to you. The town itself is nothing particularly special. The dive industry has become one of the main tourist draws here, along with the Komodo dragon tours. I have to confess my wife and I were part of the diving crowd, but I think this is a place I could return to just to hang out and relax, no tours, no diving, just quiet contemplation of my navel. Check out this hotel if you are in Labuan Bajo, you will not be disappointed. All rooms have excellent views, but rooms at the very top provide the best views. Also, there is an excellent bar called the Sunset Bar about 200m down the road that has an excellent patio to drink a cold beverage and watch the sun go down...heaven!"

The hotel is located 10-15 minutes walk up the hill from central Labuanbajo (where the dive companies operate). A simple breakfast is included and free WiFi. Rooms have hot water, fan and optional A/C. They accept credit card and as an added bonus, the toilets actually have seats.  For low-end budget travellers staying in pairs, the standard room price is not much different to the town’s cheapest hostel (NB - The Standard rooms are exactly the same as Superior rooms, but they confiscate the AC remote control – hilarious!!).

Decor is basic but bed was comfortable, room was clean, bathroom facilities were good, our porch was a lovely place to sit, read, enjoy the view. The staff were great and Ingrid and Judith very helpful with their information on what is available.Easy walk into the main drag of Labuan Bajo - about 10 minutes - so well located as you get the advantage of the views.

The delux rooms are worth it for the views and catch the breeze perfectly. Good quiet aircon. Ingrid and Judith are the personification of helpfulness from first email to providing good information and advice during our stay. All the staff were helpful and the place was very relaxed, easy to book tours and onward travel etc. Best to be aware that bemo service back up from town officially stops at 6 pm. Hotel can usually rustle up one for you but not guaranteed so you may be reliant on moped taxi. All relatively underdeveloped which is part of its charm. Loved it."

The rooms are clean with a great view, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, the coffee and homemade jelly are delicious. The rooms are not anything amazing, but after traveling across LB, these were the best rooms at any place across the island. They also set up the 2 day boat trip for us to Rinca and Komodo which was splendid."

Easy walk up from town...I would suggest that if you are older you might want to book a room not at the top of the stairs.My husband has a recovered back from a fall down a cliff and and I had a wound on my foot.Not a criticism of the place.Just practical advice. It was very clean and sparkly... Nice light... Hot water for tea and coffee provided daily. Nice book exchange ... actually had English books ... unusual.Beautiful view to a stunning turquoise bay below with sailing ships . Right at the bottom of the hill in Labuan Bajo in the evening is the Night Food market where we had fabulous seafood. Grilled fish... red snapper ... yummy yummy. Also Golo Hill is good value for the price. and they gave me an excellent recommendation for a travel agent in Bali who helped us book the 3 flights we took in Flores WE LOVED FLORES AND PLAN TO GO BACK NEXT YEAR... WE'LL COME BACK HERE ...."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Ksu","Moscow","Fantastic view, relaxed atmosphere","The hotel consists of several bungalows on the hill slope with a fabulous view of the nearby islands. The rooms are pretty basic but they have air conditioning, hot water and mosquito nets. It is a fifteen-minutes walk downhill to the port. The pool (also with a view and with additional towels) is very nice, and there is free wi-fi in the restaurant area (the food is also good but beware - the portions are huge!). The hotel owners arrange pick-up from the airport at a fair price. We also had our boat trip to Komodo and Rinca islands and a car trip to Kelimutu lakes arranged by their employee Pieter - and we couldn't be more pleased: everything was organised very well and went off without a hitch, the boat was very comfortable and clean. I highly recommend both the hotel and their organisation of trips."

Nice pool & pleasant restaurant, clean rooms and great owners and staff. We would return in a heartbeat!Ingrid & Judith put together a great tour for us from LBJ to Maumere. Peter arranged our boat to Rinca / Komodo Islands (too bad about the weather) and a delightful afternoon at the ""Tourism School"".Our trip across Flores was stunning.

"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Carperdiem","Australia","Spectacular views, only hotel worth staying at in Labuan Bajo","This is an excellent hotel with superb views of the coastline and numerous islands. The hotel is well managed and all the staff seem very good. The restaurant is reasonable (probably better than most options in town) and is in a great setting. We booked two Deluxe Rooms for our family of 4 ($US 90 for both, or $US 100 if booked through Agoda).This hotel is built on a hill with many steps leading from the restaurant / pool level up to the rooms, although the Standard Rooms are on the same level as the pool. This is not an issue unless you are old and have weak knees. The 'Deluxe Rooms' are really no more than basic rooms, but they include Air-con. All types of rooms appear to have excellent views.The town of Labuan Bajo is about 1 klm away which can be reached on foot downhill (but you will get hot and sweaty) or 20,000 IRP ($USD 2) for a ride. It will cost half that to come back.The town is in a superb setting on a bay with lots of boats and surrounded by close-by islands, all seemingly unspoilt. But the town itself, apart from being interesting, is a bit of a dump and not attractive to explore once you have got over the initial curiosity phase. However, there is some development occurring with some new hotels and restaurants being built.But the hotel is a good choice and we're glad we came to Labuan Bajo because the setting was spectacular (and unexpected) and the day trip we did to Rinca Island, seeing about 8 or 9 komodo dragons in the wild was rewarding and different and enjoyable."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","shodiver","Sydney, Australia","great place to stay in Labuan bajo","Great value for money and lovely views from the rooms and pool. Nice pool to relax by for a few hours, very peaceful location away from the noise of the town and traffic.

"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","PerthGlobal","","Great service and views","Very friendly service. Hotel had a very serene and peaceful vibe. Staff seemed very genuine and helped on many fronts. Not in town but less than 5 minute drive. Can jump on back of motorbike to get to/from town or hotel can arrange lift. My girlfriend doesn't like motorbikes at all but she grew to love the short ride on the back of a motorbike. Costs US$0.50 for one way trip (5000 local currency).Rooms were very clean. Great views, cheap laundry service, etc.Sunset bar just down the road worth a visit although don't let it distract you too much from a couple of other great places to eat or grab a drink in town. Mediterano restaurant was great. Great meals. Prices a little higher than standard, but not much.Would recommend hiring a scooter and heading away from town (as you depart Golo turn right). Scooter only costs US$7.50 a day to hire. Busy local food market only 15 minutes away. Ride through hills, quite safe I thought despite it being my first time driving a scooter!"
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Mariana B","Mexico city","Good hotel and view!","It is a good option for Labuan Bajo. Rooms are basic but comfortable, pool is nice and the view is fantastic. Food is ok, nothing special. The staff is not very friendly, specially some of the guys at the restaurant. Laundry service is very slow. They told us it would be ready the next day and it took them two days to give it back to us. The best option to go into town is to rent a motorbike or get one of the little mini buses which serve as taxis, but they don't work at night."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","pj510","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Short but pleasant stay","After deciding to make a day trip to Rinca Island to see the dragons, I needed to find a hotel to stay at on Flores for one night. Thanks to Trip Advisor, I picked Golo Hilltop. Judith and Ingrid were great. They always answered emails very quickly, they helped us arrange the boat trip to see the dragons which was a big relief, along with pick-up and drop-off at the airport. The hotel is on the side of a hill, but not too far away from town. The rooms are clean and spacious, the restaurant has a wonderful view out over the ocean. The staff friendly. We didn’t use the pool, but it looked nice. It would have been nice to stay there for two nights, but due to time constraints we could not. I really liked the fact that Judith and Ingrid were on the property and took the time to talk with you. They even called the airline for me as we were delayed, and checked to make sure it was still leaving at the time they said. Couldn’t afford to miss the flight. I would recommend staying here to anyone."

Had a very nice stay and will stay there again when I go back to Labuan Bajo. It is a bit away from the centre, which is good since it is quite, no motorbikes or honking horns. With a rented motorbike it take 7 minutes to the centre. They have a pool, which make the stay very pleasent, Every room, the resturant and the pool give you one amazing view of the ocean and you get some great sunsets."

There is a fab new swimming pool with amazing views over the bay and stunning sunset. Nice pool loungers. Lovely little café restaurant serving good food at reasonable prices. The owners and staff were very friendly and helpful. We stayed in the deluxe room up many stairs but worth it for the view. Rooms thoughtfully appointed with reading light, hooks, mop for bathroom, brush for patio, hot water provided in a thermos for your early morning coffee- all nice touches. The owners also have their own children so it is a family friendly place. Not suitable for anyone with mobility problems as a lot of stairs. A good 20 minute walk into town and back up a big hill, but there is another nice restaurant 5 minutes walk away. Do book ahead as it is usually full. Look around for tours."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Xtine02","Casteau, Belgique","Helpful in every respect!","We booked our tour round Flores through Ingrid and Judith and never regretted doing so. They were most helpful and welcoming. From Maumere to Labuan Bajo, we spent 9 splendid days, full of new encounters and discoveries. Planning was perfect, hotels well chosen. Special thanks to driver Gabi and guide Sylvester. Good hotel rooms with fantastic views, especially at sunset. Don't miss the spectacular view from the swimming pool - a rarety in Flores. You should just know that it is filled with sea water, but fresh water showers are a few meters away only. The food is correct, and after spending some weeks in Indonesia eating local food only, we appreciated chips served with mayonnaise! We would clearly recommand the Golo hotel, though it is true it is set on a hill (the steep road, in poor state of repair, was being redone when we visited and has no lights at night) so just forget having dinner in town!"
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Ben B","London, United Kingdom","Pleasant, very friendly and amazing views","We recently stayed at the Golo for three nights either side of a trip from Labuan Bajo and were in both a Deluxe and Standard Room at different times. The deluxe is definitely worth the extra - further up the hillside with a balcony overlooking the amazing view down to the sea and with more quite a bit more space.Ingrid and Judith are very nice indeed and went out of their way to welcome us, settle us in and make sure we had everything we needed. The hotel is generally very clean with beautifully maintained grounds and has a very nice pool. Food is fairly simple, but nice and there's a good supply of delicious local fruit juices.The local bar (the Paradise Bar - great for watching sunset) is just 5 mins down the road.We had a pleasant stay and the Golo Hilltop and would definitely recommend it."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","tungting","bali","Nice place with beautiful view","When I booked this hotel, they had only deluxe room available which is quite pricey for Labuan Bajo. But when you are in the room you get what you pay for. The room is spacious with huge bathroom. From the balcony you have amazing view over the sea and small islands and of course sunset (sunset in Labuan Bajo is always amazing!). There is a small swimming-pool to relax and watch the sun sets in the afternoon. The hotel is located on the hill 10-15 walking from the harbor. It's quite far from the busy town, at night you hardly hear anything. Just be prepared for climbing some steps. The more you pay the higher you get, but of course the view is more stunning. If you are fit enough, this place is really recommended."

We also liked the garden with all the flowers very much. A little oasis in the dry city of L. Bajo!The rooms are clean, basic and functional. Some of them have hot water. The food in the restaurant is basic. Sometimes there are a lot of people/ kids hanging around in the restaurant. Wifi connection is slow.The owners are really friendly as well most of the staff. Trips can be arranged by brokers, but you might pay too much. Trips can easily be arranged in the harbour. It takes about 30 minutes to walk to the city center. We couldn't find transport in the night, but the walk was fine."

We stayed there with our two little children (two and six years) in Oct 2012 and used it as a base to explore Komodo National Park.The hotel is run by two very friendly Dutch ladies (Ingrid and Judith) who went out of their way to make this a very memorable stay for us. Ingrid was so kind to lend us her daughter's snorkel mask so that our son could try some snorkelling as well and we could borrow some sun hats for the Komodo trip too which was good idea as it was already very, very hot even early in the morning.Special thanks also to Peter who helped organise our day trips to Angel Island (best snorkelling on a fantastically white sand beach), Rinca to see 'The Dragons' and Kanawa island for yet another nice snorkelling experience. Peter made sure that we had a boat which was fully covered at the sides so that the kids wouldn't fall out and that it wasn't too sunny inside.The rooms were clean and functionally furnished with a safe box, warm water and a/c in the deluxe room.The freshly prepared food and drinks were very nice and they had a good vegetarian selection as well - please try the Golo Bread which is some sort of local roll with mixed beans, sprouts, peanuts and tempe (tofu).Transfer to the town/airport (ca 30,000 Rp.) or harbour (included in day trips) is organised by the hotel via local bemo or hotel car.Wifi is also available for free in the reception/restaurant area."

"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Jochen74","Dusseldorf, Germany","Awesome views, beautiful place & really nice owners!","The Golo Hilltop is a beautiful place at a fantastic location in Labuan Bajo. The hotel ist a little out of the village, so you need to have a ~ 30 min walk into ce ""center"" - but on the other hand it has a spectacular view (since it is located on a ""Hill Top"" :)) and is very quite compared to all the other places at the main road of Labuan Bajo and close to the mosques.. though you may still hear a lizard on your veranda or the signal from the ferry or a fisherboat in the bay that partly seem to be running with something that sounds rather like a machinegun... :)Furthermore it is just next to the Paradise Bar, which is very nice place with live music (cover songs -> Bob Marley meets Pink Floyd) to have a drink in the evening or have dinner.The rooms or bungalows respectively are basic but very tastefully furnished, with a nice bathroom (hot water), AC and a very pretty veranda. Particularly the Deluxe Room, which has the even better view, is more remotely set on the site and is a bit more spacious.Ingrid and Judith, who run that place, are absolutely outstanding! Not only their hospitality and friendlyness was fantastic, they also helped us with every question we had for and during our stay and rest of the journay over Flores! At a lot of other places (also a lot more expensive ones) it was very difficult to find somebody that could or was willing to help - but no problem at all at the Golo!The swimming pool is beautiful, breakfast is pretty good, you get free Wifi (it will not cover your room, but at least in the restaurant) and the staff is usually also quite attentive.We can highly recommend that place - top value!"
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Moniquers","Vancouver","First class - great value!","I agree with @MOT99 - book ASAP to avoid disappointment. We booked months in advance, but found our first dates unavailable. Fortunately, our second dates were available. My boyfriend and I stayed in a Delux room at Golo for 2 nights after a 5D/4N diving safari and were glad we spent the extra money to stay here. The included breakfast was served in the restaurant, which is also where wi/fi is available. The pool is spectacular - as are the views from the pool deck, and the rooms. The friendly staff arranged our scooter rental ($8US/24hrs), made recommendations for dinner, and booked our massage at Yayasan Ayo Mandiri Massage. The only cons we found were: (1) the noise from the boats in the harbour, which cannot be avoided in Labuan Bajo; (2) Golo is a 20+min walk to the main street. Note that this hotel is not wheelchair accessible as there are stairs up to reception, pool and the rooms."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","MOT99","London, United Kingdom","Fab hotel, spectacular views, wonderful owners. Book now to avoid disappointment!","A great base to explore Flores from. It's a small 10 bedroom hotel and the quality of service we received outshone much larger hotels we have stayed at. Ingrid and Judith were amazing hosts. Theyorganised our trip to Rinca and the Komodo islands for us and only use boats that they have used before and can recommend. When we arrived at the harbour our boat was by far the best and the crew were great and spoke good English so we didn't need an English speaking guide. Allowing Golo to book our trip took the hassle out of us organising it ourselves and we knew what we were getting. Golo also provided towels, snorkeling gear and extra toilet rolls for our boat trip!The Golo rooms were lovely and clean. Nice sized bathrooms supplied with shampoo and bodywash. They provide safes in each room and tea and coffee is provided on your balcony with hot water each morning for your morning tea or coffee which you can drinki watching the wonderful views of the bay below. Food was great and very reasonable, and the bread rolls at breakfast, along with homemade jam were to die for! The children loved the freshly made fruit juices and we just ate at Golo restuarant. Bemo taxis could be used to get into town (Golo will order one for you) or you can hire a motor bike for 75,000 per day. Or walk, it isn't too far.We used the laundry service 10,000 rupiah per kilo (about 70p) which was great. Unlike local hotels that charged 25,000 rupiah per shirt.As per other reviews it's in a beautiful location with spectacular views from the restuarant, pool and your balcony. We stayed in the deluxe rooms with mattresses on the floor for our two children. The rooms were large enough that we didn't feel cramped at all.Unfortunately we couldn't stay for our whole trip at Golo hilltop as it was high season when we visited and we'd left it late to book. Don't make this mistake, you cannot find a better hotel on this part of the island. We had to stay at one of the three large hotels on the beach nearby and were very disappointed after Golo. That hotel wasn't a patch on Golo and three times the price!So if you're thinking of going to Flores, look no further, you won't be disappointed."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Dale63","Italy","HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","As others already wrote, this is an excellent option to stay in Labuan Bajo. My husband and I stayed there in July in a double AC room with hot water and it was large, clean and comfortable; good quality bed, bed linen and towels; fantastic view from the terrace; safe in the room; good breakfast; free wifi in lobby/restaurant.But what I’d like to point out is the great service we had from the two very kind and friendly Dutch owners in planning and booking a trip in Flores from Labuan Bajo to Maumere. We e-mailed them and they answered promptly: they arranged a good English-speaking driver (Gabriel) and booked for us all the accommodations and boat trip we wanted, for a really good price! When we arrived there, everything worked really good, also thanks to Piter, who was always very helpful in assisting us . I recommend everyone to stay in this hotel and to book in advance especially in high season if one wants the best accommodation in Flores and surely Judith and Ingrid are very reliable!"
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","AustralianLucy","Melbourne, Australia","Great option in this town","This is a very good, professionally-run hotel and is excellent value. If you want to stay there, book in advance because they are always full in peak season.The rooms are clean, but basic and I could see that before the advent of the pool that some might have considered this place a bit overpriced. But now with the pool, perched atop that magnificent view, this place is an absolute winner.Labuan Bajo is absurdly hot in the afternoons, even for Australians fairly used to hot weather. We did our activities in the morning and spent the afternoon in the pool. Not much else happens in Labuan Bajo after the sun gets high in the sky. Without the pool we would have been miserable.The food in the restaurant was quite good. I had several tasty dishes. Breakfasts were good too. The service was friendly and the kitchen is a stainless-steel modern marvel for Flores.Just one thing I’d do differently with food. They offer ‘french fries’ – of the deep fried packet variety, rather than real chips made from fresh potatoes. I wonder why?On housekeeping, I also think they should clean the rooms each day. Presently you have to ask for it and leave a key at reception. A lot of people, including myself, find it difficult to ask for things like this and we didn’t ask even though a freshening of the room would have been nice. Location: We found the walk into town easy and interesting as it takes you by the harbour which was nice (at night they grill fish there) and past some supermarkets which can be handy. We walked with children aged 4 and 7 all the way up to and past the single ATM in town without too much complaint. It was so perfectly easy to get a bemo back to the hotel for 20,000 rp that I really would not let the out of town location cause any concern.The hotel will very happily call a bemo driver to pick you up at reasonable prices also. We went out for dinner at The Lounge and had a driver take us there and collect us at a set time for 50,000.We also arranged a car and driver to take us across Flores, over 7 days, through Peter at the hotel, which worked out well. Our tours to Komodo and Rinca were down via Kanawa Island, so cannot comment on that."

Rooms are fairly basic but very well maintained and clean and large. Comfortable bed and good, quiet aircon. Basic breakfast available, restaurant food although not extensive is pretty good. Bike hire is available and if like me you are not into walking a long way is a must for getting into town. Taxi,s are also available for a reasonable cost. Another big plus is the pool, one of the few in Labuan Bajo. Again well maintained.The hosts Judith and Ingrid are exceptional hosts who made our stay very easy and pleasant. We used Labuan Bajo as a stop off point for our three day boat trip, night before and night after. We were able to leave our valuable and bags there in storage.

The choice of food though is not too many, but the restaurant located in the perfect location to spot the direct view to the bay and not too far from the swimming pool. The pool itself, I found it as the advantage as I don't think not many accommodations offer swimming pool as their guest facility.The staffs are friendly and helpful, as well as the owner. I had a chance to have a chat with Judith, one of the co-owner. She speaks Bahasa Indonesia very well, she is also very friendly, helpful and so hospitable. If you need advice on how you should arrange your extended trip to Komodo or Rinca island, as well to other part of Flores, she would help you.Golo is also able to help you arrange the car for your city's exploration or if you are keen to find souvenirs or a dinner out. The room is slightly above basic with air conditioning and fan. The rooms are spacey, clean and comfortable. The bathrooms are also clean and nice."

The owners, staff and grounds were exceptional! Taking into account that the surrounding landscape is mountainous and steap with limited flat area, this property does have steps leading up to accommodation that though simple, is very pleasant and comfortable. The views from every area of Golo are stunning ocean and island views. Making sunset something very special. To make life easier the owners organized scooters for us to get in and out of town, we paid $7.50 au per day. The pool area and reception/restaurant again very good, reasonably priced and stunning views. We left our bags and valuables locked in the safe whilst we went on our boat trip, plus had our washing done. All made very easy by the owners and staff.The price for a delux room, including a modest breakfast was very good, $45.00au. When staying in Labuan Bajo ....this is the place to stay."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Sabrina S","Basel","what a view - nice rooms - friendly staff","We've stayed at Golo for a couple of nights after our boat trip from Lombok. The view was just amazing!!! the rooms are nice and clean and the pool and the restaurant are just beautiful! food was good and the prices were ok. the two dutch owners were very friendly and helped us with all our questions. we've rented a motorbike which they brought us directly to the hotel and the also took it back from there. the road to town is quite bad, but if you want to explore the area this is the best way. just make sure that the motorbike has a functional light as there is no light half of the street up the hill (ours was broken). if you plan to dive, it's easier to get a room on a small island, the dive sides are quite far away from Labuan Bajo. We stayed at komodo resort & diving club which was just amazing!!!"

"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Dean2010JKT","JKT","Screaming kids; surly staff","Golo has a nice setting overlooking the sea. The rooms, while basic and simple, are very nicely done and clean. And that ends the positive aspects of Golo. There were numerous two year old kids screaming and crying night and day (breakfast, screaming kids; dinner, screaming kids, while sleeping, screaming kids); the staff was lacksidasical (dinner was served when someone could get away from their poker game they played at the table next to you... that was accompanied by rock n roll blaring from large speakers in the dining area (?); one guest noted that the dutch owner did more work than her whole staff....put together; obviously, they run her, she doesnt manage them) there is no training of the staff, they run a muck, not the other way around. Food quality in the 'restaurant' was poor. The rooms, while nice have the doors set up on frames that are wood to wood. While staying there, regularly hearing (or awaken) by slamming doors (which needed better engineering; and more considerate guests). Hotel is indeed a twenty minute walk to town; but *not to town proper. The walk is to the end of town where there is nothing; thus, for a walk to the active part of town, it is too far and too hot. Dutch owner allowed trip brokers to hang out at hotel and approach guests; firm handshakes and engaging smiles. One broker (*note-there is no reason to hire a broker in flores and when doing so, you might wish you hadnt) that the hotel owner recommended turned out to be lying to the guests of the hotel about the trips. These brokers are talked about around Labuan Bajo and on the internet (best to avoid them). While there, two guest got scammed out of several hundred dollars which turned into a big mess with hurt feelings and gloom that then permeated this resort setting). Flores:excellent snorkeling (dont need a broker; walk to boat/ferry docks), dragons exciting though only *45 min allowed on trail; island interior interesting but one needs many days to do properly. Would stay at Golo again? Absolutely not. (Idea: get a boat and say on the boat!)"
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Jessica K","Seoul, South Korea","Must stay on a tiny, breathtaking island","This hotel was lovely. The rooms are moderately sized and the beds have mosquito nets around the beds if you want to leave the windows open at night (although you take a chance of something getting stolen by city kids). The view from your room, the restaurant and the pool are MUST sees. It was a gorgeous sunset from our window! The grounds are beautiful with lovely landscaping. The owners are lovely women from Holland who are so kind and helpful (helped us rent a scooter and put an extra roll in bed in our room when our friend came) that you can't help but be relaxed and grateful. Also, the airport on the island is overwhelming with cab drivers and they had arranged for a cab driver to pick us up (we paid for the cab but it was a lovely and stress relieving surprise). If you are going to stay in this hotel the ONLY downfall is that it is slightly far from town (close enough you can walk but the road up to the hotel is not paved very well and sometimes cabs don't go there, so walking is how you find your way down). I would say that if you are visiting the island to go scuba diving don't get a scooter unless you plan to go up and down the hill 10 times a night or it won't end up paying for itself and you can take a cab ride on the back of the scooters for 3-5 MYR and if you tell them to come get you again on the morning they will. Overall it was a wonderful stay!"

We we're originally going to stay at the Bayview Gardens but they were fully booked.They arranged pickup from the airport for 30,000RP for us too.Our room was their cheapest at 250,000RP and was on the same level as reception/dining room. It is quite steep compared to the rest of Indonesia but has a fantastic view over the bay and you get a lot for your money. Our room was perfect except the fan is on the wrong wall and doesn't swing round to the bed which really effected our sleep quality. The cold water shower isn't cold cold. The room was exceptionally clean.The room rate included all taxes and a free breakfast and Golo has free Wi-Fi and an amazing swimming pool. You could laze around it all day no problem.The staff were great and the food good.My biggest gripe I suppose is the location. 10 minutes down a dodgy hill road to the edge of town and a further 10 - 15 minutes to get to the restaurants/bars. You could Bemo it after the ropey hill road though. If you are going to come back after dark, take a torch. It is pitch black in places.Paradise Bar is 5 minutes away has live music every night and a fantastic buffet every Wednesday, with a discount if you stay at Golo.A very good place to stay, there are many hotels and guesthouses in town if you don't like the sound of this.I'd go back though (and may try an aircon room):)"

Clean AC and fantastic views of the bay. The pool has a stunning view.The hotel manager arranged a tour of Rinca and Komodo for us for 2 days - the price was extremely reasonable with cabins and 4 crew and all meals etc. The price was lower that those offered in the town & portI have to disagree with the review below in that the staff & owners were extremely helpful & couldn't do enough for us - they have no control of the airport! Nor own the public road! The hotel itself is away from the town & away from the noise & the hustle & bustle.The food is tasty - beer cool I would totally recommend this hotel and cannot praise the owners & staff enough - thank you"
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Lora18","Saint Paul, Minnesota","Great place in a rough town","This is a lovely hotel, a saving grace, in a 'challenging' town. The room was clean and the a/c was slow to work, but it worked eventually. The staff were very nice and helped to arrange a tour to Komodo and Rinca. The hotel and tour were a bit overpriced, but that is the case with Labuanbajo in general. The pool is beautiful! The restaurant was good. I did get sick from the food, but that could happen anywhere. The staff should be trained to be a little more helpful, though: I booked a taxi to take me to the airport an hour before my flight, and when I got there I found out I couldn't even check in until fifteen minutes before my flight. I think the staff could have told me that I would be sitting on the floor of the airport (there are no chairs in the check-in area) for a while. Also, they put me in a room that was more than the one I had booked. It was fine and I paid it, but in the future I would double-check which room and price I was in. Someone (the owners?) should pay to pave the road to the hotel--man, it's bad! But overall, the hotel and pool are a respite in the town."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","BVC2","Perth, Australia","The pool is open","When I booked my room on Agoda, it said every room has a/c - well that's technically true, but for the standard room you can't turn it on... There's a wall fan, but it's located behind and to the side of the bed so it is not as effective as it could be.The room was clean but quite basic. Bed was comfortable with a mosquito net. Bathroom was clean, cold water only but shampoo and body wash provided in wall dispensers.The hotel is up a hill a short walk from town - not too challenging, though the road condition is terrible. It's an excellent location - just far enough away from town to be secluded, without being too far away like some of the newer places south of town. Halfway up the hill is the Paradise bar, apparently the only late night pub in town. I ate at both Paradise and the hotel, and both had decent food at a reasonable price.The best feature of the hotel is the new pool, set beside the restaurant with great views. If it wasn't for the pool I would say my room was over-priced, but I doubt you will find a place with a pool for less, and the location is great."

Never mind, a New Year with new opportunities so here our findings. It is a fantastic place to spend your time when in Labuan Bajo. Very friendly owners/operators and very friendly and helpful staff. Several accommodation options and they all seem very adequate. Good value for money as well. Breakfast is complimentary and served in the restaurant from where you have great views. We didn't dine there in the evening but have heard from other people that it's very good. There seems to be plans to add a swimming pool (to be built this year) which would be a great asset. Lady owner very knowledgeable about what to do when in the area. And don't forget to check out Divine Diving, also owned/operated by a Dutch woman. Happy New Year!"

"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","zcello","Adelaide, Australia","Best choice in Labuan Bajo","This hotel sits on the hills above Labuan Bajo, about 15 minutes away from the town centre. And that's one of the reasons I love it so much. Generally Labuan Bajo is not a travel destination sort of place, most people come here in transit to other places in Flores such as Komodo Island. I don't like the messy town centre at all. This hotel is quiet and enjoys the best view, the flowers and bird life around is also great. You don't need to go to the town for food or bar, the hotel offers great food, also you can walk to Paradise bar very close by, where is the place anyone in Labuanbajo goes to anyway.The rooms are nice and clean with a safety locker, and A/C as option, which are really necessary for this place. while other non-sense equipment for a budget room are absent, such as TV or bath tub, I think they put the money to the best use.Highly recommended."

The rooms are somewhat spartan but have all of the basics that you need for a comfortable night's sleep. We stayed in a deluxe room at the top of the hill, which gave us a spectacular view. A nice touch was a drying rack for wet clothes, as many tourists come to the area for diving and snorkeling. We stayed here after spending a night on a boat while traveling to Komodo Island so we were grateful for a hot shower and a clean place to relax. We had a lovely dinner at the hotel and an equally nice breakfast the next morning.We never met Judith but Ingrid was super nice and helpful. Also, the puppy is adorable!"
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","Jenjolene","Albuquerque, New Mexico","Nice hotel with wonderful views but very hard beds","Golo Hilltop is a very nice hotel with wonderful views, good food, and clean rooms. We had two minor issues: our AC worked poorly and they didn't seem interested in improving the AC or allowing us to switch rooms, and the bed we had was extremely hard and quite uncomfortable to sleep on. We were in Room 9 and maybe the other beds and AC are better. We think this hotel is probably the best lodging option in Labuanbajo. Additional note: if you need a boat, have a taxi drive you directly to the dock (do not go through a tour agency or any sort of a middle man unless you want to give them an approx. $1 million Rp/person hidden planning fee. Esp. do not pay Jak (in Lonely Planet) any money - he is a smooth talking scoundrel). Definitely hire a boat directly, it will save you approximately $1 million/person and you will get exactly the trip you want around Komodo.) Our very strong recommendation is to hire Captain Andry (+[--]). For a customized 3-day itinerary you should expect to pay no more than $3 million for 2 people. The boat is fine, the food is good and the crew is excellent. You are almost guaranteed to snorkel with Manta Rays with Captain Andry - we had the rays all to ourselves for 2 hours! We saw better boats and worse boats and feel he provides an excellent service. His English is decent enough to communicate and he wants you to have a great trip."

Yes the track is bumpy but all the taxis go up it, the view is fantastic, the rooms clean and very comfortable, the breakfast delicious and we would have loved to have stayed longer.

Spacious rooms where you can sit outside on your terrace, we had a safetybox in our room, cosy restaurant where you can also just sit and read or write.

It is not really a destination, like Bali. Therefore, you usually spend only a night or two at a hotel - This is a hotel that moves people through quickly. As such, it is a very good one.The rooms were clean with nice decor. There was a decent amount of furniture to set your things on. The A/C didn't work at first and took a while to kick in. But, when it did, it was fine. I was in room 1 which is closest to the road and the generator. Luckily, the generator was only on during the day. As the evening moved on, the road noise reduced. The rooms have a nice porch and dry rack to hang your things on.It's location was rather distant from town. However, they were very helpful in securing transport and letting us know the price to pay.The food in the restaurant was ok. The prices were reasonable. A little stingy on the breakfast though. I couldn't get the wi-fi to work. When I was going to buy another bottle of water, they suggested I fill up my empty from their water jug, which was a nice touch.If I go back to this area, I would stay here again."

We found Golo Hotel and Restaurant a very relaxing spot, received a free airport transfer and spoke with Peter, head of travel services to book our overnight boat trip to Komodo and Rinca islands.The rooms are beautiful and the view is spectacular! The beds were comfortable and eventhough we opted for not having hot water on our first night there, the water was fine (luke warm). The food at the restaurant was great value for our dollars although the portions arent too big - didnt bother us...best garlic bread EVER! The view is spectacular.Our overnight boat ride was booked directly from the hotel and was also very reasonably priced. We were the only 2 people on the boat with 3 crew and opted for no english guide and sleeping on the deck of the boat rather than having a cabin which was so much fun! They served us enough food for 4 people for our meals - which were included in the price - and the crew were a great group of men, very nice and very friendly.Keep in mind, the boat is basic (like a fisherman's boat).We saw Komodo dragons, swam with Manta Rays and had one of the best snorkelling experiences of our lives. We didnt even have to dive, the snorkelling was enough!!We would recommend Golo for the service and value for the dollars. Although a 20 minute walk from town, we didnt mind so much as we wanted a place to stay moreso before and after our overnight boat trip."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","BobB3","Rome, Italy","You can't go higher than the Golo Hilltop!","We arrived at the Golo Hilltop just before sunset and at the end of a beautiful but tiring 6 day drive from Maumere. Hotels available in the most touristed spots on the island are clean (mostly) and perfectly adequate for a night or two, but very basic. Therefore, when we were shown to our room 8 at the top of the Golo hillside, we didn't have great expectations for anything more than we had had en route from Maumere. What a pleasant surprise awaited us! Each of the rooms has a nice, covered front porch with comfy chairs, thermos of hot water for tea/coffee and splendid views. Luxuries of reading lamps, aircon, hot water shower and more were so much appreciated. And the room itself was freshly painted and so tastefully decorated. After one very restful night in that room, we set out for our two day adventure into the Komodo National Park area. On returning to the Golo, we took one of the simpler rooms at the bottom of the hillside. The view was less spectacular and there was no hot water shower, but even the simpler rooms are nicely decorated, roomy, clean and quiet. Finally, because of its location a little bit outside the town, it is nice that the hotel also have a very good restaurant attached. WiFi is available and free in the restaurant area.While the location is beautiful - that in itself an advantage - it could be a disadvantage for those who want crowds, shops, meeting spots, etc... in the evening. I'm sure the Golo can arrange for transportation into the town and back, although we never asked as we were perfectly happy to stay put in that beautiful oasis overlooking the sea."

The bathrooms need updating along with better quality mattresses and pillows.We were surprised to discover that there was no room cleaning and the wifi seemed flakey at best.

The owner of our live-aboard recommended GoLo Hilltop Hotel in Labuan Bajo, Indonesia and promised it would be above the noise, filth, and general wretchedness, of this poor fishing village. GoLo Hilltop turned out to be a wonderful place and we had two great nights.Ingrid and Judith are the hotel’s excellent and helpful proprietors. They come from Holland and therefore have high western standards. Their English is top notch. They are always helping guests with transportation, tours, airplanes, and the various non-western ways of the Indonesians. The hotel is in a quiet location on a hill overlooking the bay of Lubuan Bajo. The downtown area is also below and thankfully on the other side of the “hill”. Therefore the noises common in the town – horns, roosters, dogs, mosques – are not heard at GoLo Hilltop. The hotel grounds are landscaped with wonderful tropical plants and flowering bougainvillea. The hotel is a collection of villas like buildings each with two or three hotel rooms. The exterior of the buildings has a distinctive Dutch décor. Inside, the rooms are basic, functional, and clean. We really appreciated the absence of odors, cobwebs, dust, and bugs. Guests can choose from a variety of amenities commensurate with their budget. Some rooms have hot water, others not. Some rooms have air conditioning, others not. Some rooms have splendid view of the bay, others simply see the gardens. We had hot water and air conditioning and both were superb. All the rooms we saw had porches which everyone seemed to utilize to dry out and/or air out their belongings. Meals are served in a dining area on the bottom level of the hotel grounds. The menu included both western and Indonesian choices. The prices were good. The staff was attentive. The beer was cold and refreshing. Dinners ranged from $3 to $7. Breakfast included eggs [cooked to order], fruit, and fresh bread. There was option for pancakes. We found the food tasty. The hotel has wireless internet coverage in the dining area. So we [and other guests] tended to use this gathering spot for much more than meals. The internet worked well for grabbing emails and a few simple web chores. There is not sufficient bandwidth for serious work."

There a hanging lamp over a small table with two plastic chairs and a wall light above the bed which is quite firm and comfortable. Breakfast is included but your options are gooey pancakes or white bread toast, but the fruit/juice is good. The only real drawback is on alternate days, power is turned off all afternoon and will only be reconnected in the evening thus there is zero respite for the searing midnoon sun."

"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","TrevorHall","Market Rasen, United Kingdom","Superior Views, Superior Quality","Beautiful rooms set on the hilltop (obviously) above the pleasant chaos of Labuan Bajo, yet it's a short and easy walk from the hustle and bustle of the town. I'd definitely recommend spending a little extra and taking a room at the top of the complex, as you're even shaded from other guests. Staff are polite and meet one's every need, and the two Dutch lady owners are kind, accommodating and helpful. Perfectly located for scuba diving the Komodo National Park. Breakfast is plenty, and the freshly baked bread, delicious. Highly recommended and easily the best in Labuan Bajo."
"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","wateryrave","illinois","Great view, warm hospitality, decent rooms, scary stairs.","We stayed just two nights, on either end of a little dive trip. We booked directly through the hotel website, and the owners were very quick and responsive with email. They provided a free pickup from the airport, which we very much appreciated, and the vibe was casual, warm and welcoming. The restaurant/reception area is full of personal picture albums and educational info about the area, and it's obvious the owners are there because they appreciate the island. I thought before I arrived that I might end up wishing I had planned more time on Flores, and after our stay up there, I definitely wish we would have. The rooms are spare but attractive, and the views from the balconies are awesome. Plenty of space inside and out. In addition to their included breakfast, which starts early in the morning, they also leave a carafe of hot water with some tea and instant coffee on the terrace table. A nice touch. Now for the less-than-great part--the stairs! I had somehow imagined the ""Hilltop"" part of the name related more to the march up the road than the march up the property stairs. The walk up the hill from town to the hotel isn't actually bad at all, and it puts you in a much more peaceful place than anywhere we saw in town. But the stairs at the hotel are killer, especially if you are, like we were, carrying some 60 lbs. each of bulky, awkward dive gear, or if one of your party is prone to sore knees. Up is hard, down is just plain scary! Some of the stairs are steep, others are shallow, and there's not always a place to put a steadying hand. Fortunately, there's always someone, be it staff or bemo driver's kid, who's willing to lend a hand. We had the highest rooms. If I were bringing that kind of luggage again, I'd ask for a lower room--the climb to those isn't bad at all.Given that, I think this would still be my top pick for a return visit."

"Labuan Bajo","Golo Hilltop Hotel & Restaurant","1","grey.dave","Yorkshire, UK","An excellent place to stay","This is an excellent place to stay when you visit Labuanbajo. Lots of positives, and just a couple of negatives.Positives include the rooms, which are well cooled, clean, and have great sunset views. The newer rooms are higher, beautifully finished, and have hot water, although it must be said that the cold water in the older rooms is really lukewarm, being stored in a holding tank in full sunlight.Other positives are the welcome and service you get here, the quality and price of the food, and the ability of the hotel to organise your trips out to Komodo and Rinca (we chose Rinca and are really pleased that we did so). They also arranged our transport from Maumere through the interior of Flores.Clues to the negatives are in the name of the hotel. It's on a small hill at the edge of town. The walk down into town is fine; it takes around 10 minutes to get to the main road where the Bemos run past. The walk back up takes longer, particularly at hot times of the day, at night, or after rain. You can sometimes get Bemos to go up the hill from town, at a cost of only Rp30k, but not always. The second negative related to the hilltop site is that there is unfortunately no room for a pool.Overall I wouldn't recommend the Golo Hilltop to anyone with mobility problems, and for that matter neither would I recommend Flores! But for other travellers I think it's a really good value option. We greatly enjoyed the 5 nights we spent there."

Book the new rooms. Good value for the price and the hotel has a perfect & very cheap restaurant.

Labuan can be very noisy with motor bikes and mosque music, but Golo, being a short walk from town avoids that.The renovated top rooms are very luxurious and still not expensive.The food is to die for, especially the fish buffets and the home -made bread.The staff are very friendly, and nothing is too much trouble for them.

The restaurant is clean and you have a meal not having to worry how the food has been handled. The hotel is run by a couple the wife is dutch and the husband indonesia, they are very friendly, the hotel could do with new beds and a few extras, but it sounds like they are being held ransom by the landlord.

"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","","Derby, United Kingdom","Best place to stay in Labuan Bajo - even the dolphins think so!","By far the best place to stay in Labuan Bajo. Staff are extremely friendly, helpful and ever-present. It is clear that the resort is under good management. The pool is immaculate and very well maintained; surrounding gardens are groomed and clean. The small private beach is also relatively clean, by Labuan Bajo standards (it is a port city so plenty of rubbish and debris drift in with the tide everywhere.) I walked down to the beach early one morning, at sunrise to find a few folks raking and cleaning the sand, getting it ready for guests to enjoy. There also seems to be a resident pair of dolphins; twice I spotted them at sunset playing in the ocean right in front of the resort!All staff speak English (to varying degrees). Rooms are spacious and clean fitted with modern amenities including air conditioning, a safe, a small drinks fridge a drying rack for clothes and mosquito repellent cream to apply to your skin and a burning-device to plug in during the night). Each room also has a private little patio/balcony looking out onto the garden and towards the ocean which is great for early mornings. I stayed for five nights – could have easily stayed for a whole month! Flores and the surrounding islands have loads to see and do. The staff at Puri Sari helped organize all of my day trips out, making phone calls, arranging transfers to and from town and making sure I was charged reasonable rates. Puri Sari has a free car shuttle service that runs every 30mins. Even so though, on the odd occasion I wanted to go into town outside of the shuttle hours they were very quick to accommodate my request, prioritizing customer satisfaction is clearly on everyone’s mind. I have a gluten allergy and after mentioning this to management, arrived to breakfast the next morning to a delightful plate of warm rice-flour cakes! Not sure where/how they procured these but it was a real teat!Lots of other small things around the hotel too which distinguishes it from others; you get complimentary bottled water which is replenished every day, room is freshened up daily and there are complimentary towels at the pool. Kayaks are also available to rent; there is plenty soap, shampoo and conditioner in the bathroom plus a toothbrush! Towels could do with a good soak/clean as some are a bit worn and grey (but after roughing it for weeks I was just glad to have my own, clean set of towels to be honest). Linen on the beds are of high quality, a little warn and faded, could do with a proper wash but they are more worn then filthy.The resort restaurant is perhaps the only thing I can criticize; though they have a good selection of options on the menu, it is a small run kitchen and food, though reasonably priced, is average It is an open air dining area and they suffer from a serious fly issue – so much so that you literally “eat and run” in the mornings to get away from them. The staff seem resigned to the pesky flies’ presence however after speaking to management about it, they had set out citronella candles the next morning to keep them at bay which helped (somewhat). For dinner try the salad, its very good! The Indonesian mackerel is also a good option, great for sampling the local tastes and flavors. Ask for an extra helping of the spicy salsa."

The room we had 103 was huge and very clean with a range of toiletries, moxie repellents/plug ins etc. V comfy large bed and great patio seating area.Pool was just by the beach, spotless and with nature (towels provided).Definitely the best choice around - we miss it x"

"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","Colin R","Sydney, Australia","Private pool and beach, with comfortable rooms and great service","This small hotel complex is perfect to relax in this still relatively undeveloped Indonesian island location. The rooms we stayed in were large, clean and comfortable with their own verandah which looked out across a beautiful garden. There's a decent pool in the grounds near a small, private beach. The restaurant is excellent, serving good, fair-priced food. A really excellent breakfast is also provided.We found the service really excellent from the start, with friendly staff who are keen to help. However, we really got to see how wonderful the staff were when my wife broke her ankle in the town on our last evening - the hotel really came to our rescue. They couldn't have been more helpful. And while you wouldn't want to visit with the expectation of having an accident, its great to know that the already-excellent service gets even better just when you need it."
"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","smillybiff","Wellington, New Zealand","Great stay","My husband and I booked in here for three nights and extended for another three. The hotel is so lovely and peaceful and excellent value for money. We had a nice room that had a king size bed and large bathroom with patio out the front. It was very clean and serviced quickly each day. The grounds of the hotel are nice and the pool area is excellent. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. A few kms out of town but they will shuttle you in and out whenever you need so this wasn't a problem at all. Breakfast isn't anything flash and the beach out the front isn't a swimming beach due to a large volume of organic debris washed up ashore. When booking any boat tours through the hotel it's recommended that you take a trip into town to the pier to see the boat. We booked a tour and were shown a photo of a nice boat that we'd be on, only to arrive on the day to a far less desirable boat. Nevertheless we stood out ground and our money was refunded without any hassle. Overall, top marks for Puri Sari - a very pleasant and enjoyable stay. I'd highly recommend this hotel."

The large pool nice, but the water a bit too warm, though a nice place to lounge about and have a drink with friends. Restaurant not bad with a great breakfast buffet, though when we were there, a lot of flies around during the morning, that management should try to minimize.

Take advantage of the massage...in your room, by the pool, under the trees by the beach it's up to you. Breakfast is good lots to choose from, fresh omelettes. If you are not happy with something just let a member of staff know, they will sort it out. The shuttle bus into town was good, takes about 10mins, sometimes you have to wait a few minutes for other guests who are also going into town. This worked really well, you could book a time in advance or just turn up, it all works. Gardens are wonderful attracting birds and butterflies. My wife did the hard work finding this, I just enjoyed it. We initially booked for 2 days, we stayed for 10."

"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","paperduck","Perth, Australia","Friendly and comfortable local resort","We just stayed one night here on our way to Scubajunkie Komodo, but we were impressed by the size and comfort of the rooms and the helpfulness of the staff. It's not pretending to be a luxury resort and doesn't have a great deal of character - but it is a very clean and comfortable low rise option, with large rooms, comfy beds, good aircon and reliable wifi. If you need a couple of nights in transit in Labuan Bajo, or a longer stay at a medium range hotel I think it's a good choice. It's a little out of town, on a quiet stretch of beach. They keep the beach directly in front of the resort swept clean and there is a small beach bar with a good view to the setting sun. The pool is a decent size and a the grounds are spacious and well kept. There is a shuttle into town if you need it but we were happy to be staying outside of the centre - Labuan Bajo is relatively small, so nowhere is very far to get to.The staff were really helpful and accommodating and obviously trying very hard to meet all the guests' needs. They organised a massage at very short notice, picked us up from the airport for free and were good about giving us a late check out. Food was better than expected - not spectacular but better than many similar grade places we have stayed at."

Firstly, the staff go out of their way to make sure you have an enjoyable experience and are friendly, accommodating and flexible to your needs- it is a very homely place. My room was spacious, clean and comfortable with an outside table area, overlooking the gardens. It is nice and somewhat rustic place, rather than overly posh and shiny. The room has some really nice touches to it, like special mosquito plugs etc. making you feel very well catered for. The bathroom was significantly large.The restaurant at the hotel was OK. I had soup and bruschetta at the hotel which was OK- nothing particularly special. The breakfast had a decent variety of hot and cold food but again the taste was average. The hotel has some nice gardens to walk around in and sofa areas to relax. I had a free pick up from my dive centre too. WIFI connection was very good.If I was to return to Labuan Bajo, I would come back here. It is not a posh hotel, but a good quality and friendly hotel. They could make their food better, but this is a minor part of the overall experience."

Breakfast is buffet with eggs any style and pancakes to order. Very nice, but the buffet is full of flies. They should place fans to keep them away. The swimming pool and beach offer enough beds/parasols.You can tell staff is really trying (they are very young), but a more experienced person should better supervise them and train them on the details that are lacking."

The staff were endlessly friendly and keen to help. All the reception desk staff and restaurant staff spoke good English, the look of fear in the faces of the non-English speaking staff when we spoke to them was endearing, and then their relief when an English speaking colleague turned up.The breakfast was pretty good, we enjoyed the banana fritters and proper indo coffee, plus the freshly cooked eggs to order. We did have a breakfast box one morning as we left before breakfast started, the fruit was tasty, but the toast was cold and stale by the time we got to eat it.We watched a stunning sunset over the beach, the colours were beautiful, well worth braving the biting insects for."

The rooms are very clean and spacious. We had rooms on the first floor and could see the sea. The breakfast is good and the staff is very friendly. The hotel is a bit out of town, but they have a shuttle to town which works well. The surroundings are quiet. Great value for money!"
"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","Lenaschwi","","The absolutely best hotel in Labuan Bajo","We are travelling now for about 2 month in Indonesia and the Puri Sari Hotel was one of our favorite places to stay! We stayed here for 3 nights and than later returned and stayed for 5 nights more. When we arrived the staff picked us up at the harbour for free and welcomed us lovely. You just have to love the whole young team which is always friendly and helpful. The rooms are gorgeous as well as the nice garden with a pool, the private beach and the restaurant with view on the sea. Last one also serves very good food and a stunning breakfast with the best bread in Indonesia so far. We just enjoyed our time here and when we came back the staff remembered us and showed real happiness about our comeback as we were family members! A big plus is the free transfer to the city as well."

Very large rooms with basic amenities. Comfortable beds, small balcony area, lovely gardens full of wildlife (birds, lizards etc). Shower not always hot but not a problem. Lovely pool and gardens. Did not use beach but looked clean and safe. OK breakfast included. Inexpensive laundry facilities. Staff very friendly and willing."

"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","Dan M","Cupertino, California","Great place if you don't need Internet","We stayed here 6 nights.Puri Sari is in a nice location, surrounded by beautiful gardens with a view out to the sea. The rooms, beds, and bathrooms are gynormous. The staff are very friendly and helpful - they demonstrate the Hotel's priority, to make the hotel feel like home. Everything is clean. The breakfasts are great. Lunchs and dinners are satisfactory.They a very convenient free shuttle to the town. The only issue is calling the shuttle when the hotel's phones don't work.Our primary complaint is the internet. Connecting is generally problematic. Once you are connected you're apt to be dropped. When you're connected the performance is poor, particularly in the morning and evening when other guests are using it. We have to re-log in, several times per hour. Sometimes we just gave up and used our phone data plans instead. To their credit, the hotel management did seem to be trying to improve the internet, but to no avail. Also, the other hotels in the area may not have better internet - that's why we didn't move.The hot water system seems to be solar, with almost no reservoir. So we could get hot water only when the sun is shining."

Our first impression was that the location was quite far out of Labuan Bajo but when I spoke to people staying in the town centre they all commented on the nearby mosque.Nice, large, clean rooms. No mosquito nets provided.The food was very average. We preferred to eat outside of the hotel.Friendly staff. Nice little swimming pool. Pleasant garden setting."
"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","Frogfish2015","Jakarta, Indonesia","Beautifully landscaped oasis","This hotel was situated just outside the town centre - they offer a free shuttle to and from the town, which is really convenient and vey reliable. It only takes 5 or 10 mins by car, and it's even possible to walk it in about 40 minutes, if you're so inclined. It is right on the beach and has gorgeous gardens and a nice, private pool, too. The rooms are very spacious indeed, each with a little outside area where you can sit and enjoy the sunshine. Breakfast was nice - delicious brown bread and a range of cooked things and fresh fruit. The coffee was surprisingly poor, given how nice the coffee from this region is, but that was a very minor minus point in what was otherwise a really great stay. The staff here are all super friendly and helpful and we would definitely stay here again."

The free shuttle is great. We chose to stay here before and after our live-aboard trip and had a terrible experience with our dive operator that subsequently ruined our entire trip and caused us to have to make arrangements to leave the island a week early. This hotel was flexible in changing up our reservations and gave us good advice to help us change our airlines tickets and prevent us from losing even more money as a result of our unfortunate circumstances."

"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","Jerry A","Los Angeles","Top notch stay in a great location","I originally booked the Puri Sari for one night. I stayed for six. The resort is new and really gets everything right. The rooms are squeaky clean, as well as the open and airy common areas. The staff are friendly and always smile. Their hospitality seems genuine. While the Puri Sari is located about a five minute drive from the main town, the shuttle is always available to take you. They are supposed to charge you Rp. 25,000 for each trip, which is a very fair price, but I never wound up being charged once. The restaurant has a good mix of Indo and Western food. The prices are low by tourist standards in Indonesia and the quality is high. The free breakfast consists of toast and jam, fried rice and noodles, fried chicken, an omelette station, coffee tea and juices. It's really a nice breakfast. The property is large and you often feel you have it all to yourself. Their beach isn't the most beautiful one in Flores, but they have beach chairs out, and the pool is very nice. I couldn't recommend this place more. Everybody here does a wonderful job. pS. Refrigerators in the room are ice cold!"
"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","Mas_ari83","","Nice Quiet Beach Hotel","We stayed there for four nights and really happy to stay there, it's easy from town or Komodo airport. Green and spacey is my first impression about Puri Sari Hotel. Big big gardens front and rear of the hotel, with few rooms with both garden or sea view. I stayed in 2nd floor, the room was clean, spacey, simple and comfort bed and also large bathroom. The staff is very friendly also the trainee who learn the experience of working in an hospitality business. With the amount that I have to pay per night it's worthy to spend more days to explore Labuan Bajo, Komodo & Rinca or West Flores until Ruteng. I enjoy the panoramic view in the sunset time, really breathtaking with many small island around make it complete. The swimming pool is great and very clean. Wifi and internet connection are working so well. Not gonna complain about the pick up service as I really enjoy to walk to the town and having dinner outside. For breakfast menu it's very simple but it's OK. Overall it's really a good choice to stay in this hotel, quiet and nice. For sure I'll be back there on my next visit in Labuan Bajo."

The rooms are very large with comfortable beds and the bathroom is large as well. The staff is wonderful. The pool is great. One can also laze on the beach. The lounge area has many sofas for enjoying the view and the breeze. The food is excellent with a variety of Indonesian and Western choices. The only exception is breakfast which is the same every morning and minimal. The hotel is about a 10 minute drive from town, but the shuttle is free, convenient and readily available for drop off and pick up. We made extensive use of it. We would definitely stay here again."

The rooms and facilities were clean and well maintained. We had brought the wrong electric adapters and they lent us one Pool is clean but quite warm !Breakfast was fine The shuttle bus into town is good value ( 50000IDR return ) much better than the town taxis You could walk to LBJ in about a hour. We hired scooters for a day also which were amazing value at 75000IDR a day but best taken out into the countryside rather than LBJ which was an adventure."

"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","Nohmad","Oslo, Norway","Delightful!","A perfectly delightful small hotel on the beach a couple of km outside Labuan Bajo. Welcoming and helpful hosts, free shuttle service to town and to/from the airport. I stayed 3 nights - escape from Jakarta - and enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere in the lovely tropical garden. My room was upstairs and had a lovely view over the garden and the sea. You can take lazy morning strolls on the beach (and be thankful that you didn't book into one of the neighboring concrete monster hotels) or relax by the pool, which is big enough for exercise. The staff will put you in touch with tour organizers if you wish to explore the island or go out and see the beasts. Comfortable room, sparely but tastefully decorated. My only complaint was that I wanted to have the balcony door open at night, but was advised against it. This is the same with most Indoneasian hotels: they come with air con and not mosquito nets. I would much prefer an open window, fan and mosquito net to a cold breeze from a noisy aircon! Apart from that: happy to recommend this small and charming hotel!"

The staff made us feel special and welcome. Although very young staff they were excellent and it was a joy to watch them have so much fun together whilst carrying out their duties. The food was good but needs more attention to detail - chips cooked in old oil, crispy chicken not crispy. Breakfast good but limited, although they served the best tea during our month stay in Indonesia. We would have rated this as a five star if not for the food."

"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","2011Happy_Traveler","Stellenbosch, South Africa","Best deal, convenient location","While in Labuan Bajo one needs a clean room on a well kept property and kind people. PURI SARI fits that bill 100%! 10 Minutes away from the busy centre and lots of restaurants, this property is highly recommended. It is very quiet, well kept and super clean. The owners are such kind and warm-hearted people, very caring and always there to check if you need something and are interested to listen to the stories of your daily excursions. Labuan is your starting point to explore the Komodo National Park by boat. So all you need is Puri Sari for the night or to spend some hours on the well maintained and beautiful pool. The beach is not for swimming, as the water is too close to the city centre and not really clean, which goes for most of the hotels in Labuan. But who needs the beach there if one can swim in crystal clear turquoise water a few minutes out by boat.Breakfast and dinner is ok, but I suggest rather take the hotels free shuttle in and out of town for dinner. Highly recommended is MEDITERRANEO by the way.Very reasonably price for a perfect stay. We will be back for sure!"

"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","atomic1111","Zurich, Switzerland","OK hotel option in Labuan Bajo","First of let me start by saying there are limited hotel options in/near Labuan Bajo. But you are here to explore Komodo and nature - so maybe who care... And yes Flores and Komodo are truly amazing. Overall the place felt run down, and felt a bit dirty. The pictures are inflated, and not really what the place looks like in real life. The pool was OK, and the beach left a lot to be desired, and I would not recommend spending any time there. The Good: -really not much to say in terms of good, I guess the service was OK, and they do offer a free shuttle to town center The bad: - Rooms are not very clean, and didn't feel secure (security guard walking around, randomly opening any door what is not locked without knocking) - Location is outside of town, so moving back and forth requires either taxi, hotel shuttle, or scooters - Pool area is just OK - Restaurant food (breakfast, as well as other meals) is not good, and I would strongly suggest going somewhere else to eat Overall I would not stay here again, and we moved to a different spot after our first night."

The reason for our stay was to dive the Komodo National Park. We stayed for six nights. The hotel and its surroundings were very pleasant. This location, away from the hub bub of the centre of Labauan Bajo lent itself to quiet nights but was conveniently located so as to go in and out of the town in the evenings. The hotel offers its own taxi service for its guests.The pool was a great place to relax and service at all locations in the hotel was exemplary. Within the staff compliment was a mix of trainees who were adequately supervised to develop their skills, all in all they were all very caring and helpful.

Beach is cleaned in front of the hotel, with breathtaking sunset.Breakfast is Buffet type was only Ok.

The garden is nice close to the hall, but could be improved as you get closer to the beach. The pool could be kept cleaner.

The staff were extremely helpful, wifi was excellent, rooms were large and cleaned to a very high standard and the swimming pool was clean and refreshing.

"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","DiveMedic1","Melbourne, Australia","Great hotel with lovely amenities and service.","My partner and I and 6 other friends were booked into the Puri Sari Beach Hotel as part of a four night 5 day dive package with Dive Komodo. Altogether, we spent 5 comfortable and relaxed nights here. This was a great package and we were very pleased with the level of accommodation it provided.We were met at LBJ airport in two mini buses. With all of our dive gear we just fitted in! It's a relatively short trip from the airport and we were soon being welcomed by the hotel's staff with a cool drink and shown to our rooms. Our rooms were lovely. They were sparkling clean, large and comfortable. They were equipped with a kettle and tea and coffee making. This was a great plus and one we haven't encountered often in dive accommodations. The bathroom was huge and there was a drying rack which we hung our wet dive suits on each night. Our air conditioner was struggling to cool the room. The maintenance staff looked at it promptly when we reported it, but were unable to get it working to full capacity. They offered us another room but we elected to stay put. When we returned to the hotel for one night at the completion of our dive live-board, we were in a different room and the aircon was fine.The breakfasts were very good with fresh fruit every morning. Choice was limited however. Our evening meals were tasty and of a good size but tended to be served to our table of 8 one meal at a time! So by the time the first served were finished, the last meals were being delivered. Again the choices of meal were limited. The waiting staff were lovely so we were hard pressed to be disappointed with the slow service and limited range of meals. I've said location is average. I'm referring to the distance from the centre of LBJ. It's too far to walk. However, the hotel provided our transport to and from LBJ when ever we wanted it, so long as we booked in advance. Most days it was a shuttle arrangement as there was only one vehicle available most times.The hotel is right on the beach. It's a beautiful location and the hotel grounds were well maintained and attractive. There is a clean pool beach side and a small cafe to buy a snack and drink.Even if we hadn't been there as part of a package, we would have been very happy staying there. We have since recommended the Puri Sari Beach Hotel to both family and friends. We are considering another trip to Komodo this year. We'll definitely stay at the Puri Sari then."

We even had a wonderful cot ready in our room when we arrived.The restaurant has a good selection of local dished very reasonably priced.The free shuttle takes you to/from town whenever you want.The bed was really big and comfortable.

The beach is in 2 minutes walk, but the pool was nicer for relaxation with all the plants and flowers!Large rooms with balcony!The staff is cleaning the room even if you say that you are going to check out soon and its not needed :) Nice touch of course!The hotels car is ready to bring you to the town for shopping in app 15 minutes. The only problem was inexperienced restaurant staff, some with weak English knowledge. However I was assured by the manager, that they are fresh recruits and that will quickly improve. I believe!Overall, great experience"
"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","TJ V","","Work in progress","The hotel is out of town, beyond walking distance. It does offer a convenient shuttle service which works well.The hotel's open layout is great. It has large rooms, huge bathrooms and most rooms have an outside porch. Staff is friendly but still a bit amateurish; it took 3 tries to calculate the 21% tax and service on our dinner bill. The beach lacked shade and was dirty, a sad collection of all the garbage Indonesians tend to throw into the sea. The garden and pool are nice, but need minor repairs.We were among the very few guests in March, and maybe things are better during the high season, but that seems no excuse."
"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","Masca","Ottawa, Canada","Cons outweigh Pros","Reviews praising this hotel surprise me. Yes, the gardens are nice but half the walkway has bricks blocking the way. The staff is friendly, the rooms a good size but decor is sterile and the bathroom, depressing. The free shuttle is handy but it's also necessary as the breakfast is the worse we had in 30 days of travelling around Indonesia. I can't imagine what the other meals are like.The pool is nice but only one lounge had a cushion & there're no umbrellas for shade.To get to the rooms or to the dining room you have to climb steep stairs. There's no TV but reception staff have one. We could only take two nights then left for Laprima hotel for our last two nights."
"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","Scott A","Mukilteo, Washington","Comfortable and Relaxing","I was booked for one night in the Puri Sari Beach Hotel as part of a tour to Komodo National Park. The room was huge as was the bathroom, complete with a shower which would be comfortable for 6 people. No TV but I didn't find that a problem. The gardens are beautiful, with a very nice pool and direct access to the wide sandy beach. The only down side for me was that the kitchen was closed during my stay but the hotel provided shuttle service to another hotel nearby for meals. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. I especially enjoyed the Bali Style coffee in the room instead of the usual Nescafe Instant Coffee normally found in hotels. I also enjoyed sitting on the balcony watching sunbirds feeding on a tree in the garden. If you are looking for a quiet, comfortable and relaxing place to stay when going to or from Komodo National Park, I can highly recommend The Puri Sari Beach Hotel, hopefully the kitchen will be open by then."

The rooms and beds are quality. It is a bit far from town, but as long as you're not in a terrible hurry, you can wait for the van to come pick you up. Restaurants in town seem to be accustomed to this, and they are happy to call the hotel for you."
"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","Denys S","Melbourne, Australia","Nice hotel","The resort has a nice garden around it. There is a swimming pool and adjacent spa. Air conditioning works well, rooms are clean, beds quite soft and big. The breakfast is fine. While the range of choices can be improved, the food itself is tasty. There is a shuttle bus (van) to take guests to the town. It works quite well. There is a beach and a volley ball court. Due to the ocean water being not that clean near the shore there is limited opportunity to swim. This is true for all beaches around the town."
"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","MrPaul50","Sydney Australia","No complaints","Its OK - Staff are very helpful and trying hard. Restaurant and food needs much improvement - Shuttle and pick up service to town worked well.Rooms are nice and big, and the pool and short walk to the beach is all good. The bathrooms are dated - but again huge Gardens were water logged"
"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","CliveB","clevedon","Improving Hotel","This is my second review of this place and it is getting better...new management there are going through the process of upgrading the pool area and the general place, food service there is improving and all I can say is that it is getting better each time I visit.The new pool area is nice and now the hotel has direct access to the beach and have cleaned the beach area in front of them.It sounds like there will be further structural improvements over the coming years which will only be good for this great little hotel and for travellers to Flores. Expectation's play a big part and on Flores you cannot compare to luxury hotels on Bali, so as long as you have an open mind, this hotel will surprise you if you let it."
"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","ForRealOne","Indonesia","very average on all fronts, terrible food","A strange hotel which is something of a 20 year throw back in terms of the way it operates.On the plus side:- the rooms are large and spacious, possibly too large and out of scale.- the staff are very friendly and try hard.- the WiFi sort of works. Very up and down but at least it is there.On the down side:- food is intolerably bad, particularly breakfast.- the whole place has a feeling of an owner that does not really care too much. The small things are not attended to.- the garden is lovely but very poorly designed with woefully inadequate drainage. When it rains, water pools and sits there stagnant for days on end. The whole property was infested with mosquitoes when I was there.- the beach in front of the hotel is horribly dirty.It's really a shame that the ownership do not pay more attention as this could be a very nice property. The friendly junior staff are its saving grace at the moment."
"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","Huibert74","Amsterdam, The Netherlands","One of the best choices in town","We spent 6 nights here, the perfect base for exploring LB, the islands and Pulau Rinca. Very friendly staff, big clean rooms and nice views. Shuttle service is a nice extra. Has lot more potential. Seems hotel is working on this. Only downside is beach. During the rainy season the gardens can hardly manage the water, paths are flooded."
"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","UbudYogi","Ubud Bali","Best Location - spacious rooms.","Now this property was by far the best choice -for Labuan Bajo.Why. There is nothing as quiet, clean, simple, spacious... set in a natural garden (""Eco""), with smiling staff, and free shuttle service (and free internet) around LB.Of course- if it were in Ubud or Seminyak (Bali), I would not be happy with the price -versus service ratio. There are hundreds of Hotels BETTER for HALF the price than ""Puri Sari"" , but you humbly accept what is given, if you go that far EAST.And I appreciated immensely to be able to RELAX without street noise, pollution or Mosque. -In a big spacious bed, a big AC room with internet (really they don't have TV ? I didn't notice, I forgot :) and a beautiful swimming pool, with towels and chairs.. close to the beach. I didn't believe the receptionist who said ""swimming No good"". Certainly the ocean is a bit ""flat"", but if you wait for high tide... we had great swimming in a safe water. Let's not talk about ""Breakfast"". I humbly accept their version of breakfast, knowing that it takes quiet some effort to provide western kind of food, but it wouldn't be really a big deal to provide ""Smoothies"" and vegetable juice, and porridge...with all the fruits in the market, and oats in the supermarkets.. Its not-knowing, and nobody has taught them.. Don't go there for ""Food"" - you get it in the Italian and Greece Restaurants in the harbour."

I initially wanted to stay at Golo Hilltop because of the great reviews, so it was disappointing when we couldn't get in. We finally settled for Puri Sari, and ended up having an enjoyable stay.By far, the hotel was the most professionally managed compared to all other hotels we stayed in during our time in Indonesia. The staff were approachable and helpful. The rooms were modern and clean. The garden was delightful (I've uploaded a picture). My daughter enjoyed swimming in the pool at the end of each day. It was a bit of a distance from the harbour, but I quite liked being away from the noise of town. I walked into town one day to get the exercise. I enjoyed walking past the cows, goats, chooks, cats, dogs, houses, crops, and ocean scenery. It was an easy 50 minute stroll.I'd recommend this hotel if you're heading down to Flores. It was about Aus $70/night. It was very good value for money."

Last time I stayed in a hotel with no TV was about 5 years ago, forgot how much it actually made me enjoy the simple nature there. This time was the same, I definitely enjoyed the nature and beautiful garden work there. Beach side, all nature, nice crew and roomy space with a very reasonable rate, also free shuttle bus service going in and out of town. I was very happy to have stayed there."

"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","Tamsin J","","The BEST CHOICE in Labuan Bajo!","We moved to Puri Sari from Golo Hilltop when they could not accommodate us for one of our nights. Puri Sari is a gem -- for its excellent service, cleanliness, friendly staff, amazing food, postcard sunsets, beach... We rate Puri Sari as 150%! We are so happy that we chose this hotel. It is bigger and more beautiful than their website. Breakfast is included and you have a selection. Chicken satay is amazing. Jakarta noodles are great. The staff are so friendly and helpful. Lyuzz and his restaurant team are very professional and sweet guys. Everyone from the cleaning & maintenance to the front desk staff smiled and greeted us every day. The rooms are huge, spotlessly clean, and secure. They do a security walk at midnight and even lock your door for you. We had a second story balcony room overlooking a garden of paradise! They are bigger and more ""grand"" than their current website show. You will not be disappointed by choosing this hotel for its value and quality."
"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","amie8175","amie8175","Pefect for diving or relaxing, exceeded our expectations!","From the moment we were met at the airport with a big welcoming smile to the moment we left we cannot recommend this hotel enough. All the staff were wonderful and couldn’t do enough to help us. Our room was beautiful- we emailed ahead and told them it was our honeymoon and an array of petal’s in a love heart and intricately decorated our bed (really comfy massive bed). It had a lovely balcony, extremely clean and cleaned and tidied daily, lovely walk in shower and modern throughout. The location is perfect, amazing little swimming pool, right on the beach (the hotel’s portion of which is kept pristine- other parts are a little messy with fishing related item’s sprawled over it in some places) and most importantly away from the noise of the village!!! You can get as many free taxi’s as you like from the hotel into the village to the various restaurant’s or day trips. Breakfast was great, fresh fruit, fresh juice, tea or coffee and a choice of Indonesian, Continental or American breakfast- served from 6 too which was ideal if you are diving as we were (lovely airy large restaurant on second floor with great view). Our taxi to the dive shop in the morning was also prompt and always ran smoothly, making it very easy (hotel transport). They served lunch in the restaurant as well as dinner- range of western and Indonesian food, always tasty and priced a bit less if not the same as the rest of the big restaurants in town. You get water every day in your room plus insect repellent and banana’s and use of pool towels, tea and coffee making facilities plus a fridge. I think there are only 16 rooms so it never felt too busy and there was always sunbed’s etc. although I believe it was full. An ideal hotel for diving or just relaxing, highly recommend.Booked as a dive package through Dive Komodo."

This hotel has big spacious and clean rooms. A big difference compared to all other hotels in Flores, a high standard but no atmosphere. If you want to go in town for diner you need a car, a shuttle service from the hotel is 50000 IDR. For the Komodo excursion we had to leave very early (5am) and the hotel made for us a breakfast box, excellent service !"
"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","Bobbie008","Prince Edward Island","Great beachfront hotel with a great pool","We stayed at Puri Sari for 2 nights before a 3 day trip on a liveaboard boat. The pool was beautiful and just the right temperature, the beach was deserted and immaculate, and the rooms were tidy (but not 5 star) with large showers. The staff were so nice and helpful. The banana pancakes were delicious. They shuttled us into town 4 times a day for free. We liked it so much we came back for another night after the boat trip, and they let us leave luggage there while we were away. I highly recommend it as a lovely quiet hotel with outstanding service."

Super friendly staff, taxi service to village whenever you need to, clean, great swimmingpool and nice view....... oh and did I tell you about the sunsets from the beach... just amazing! one of the best I've seen... and even better was that you could order beer from the pool bar while it was happening!I'd definitely stay again."
"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","Isabelle D","Redhill","Lovely deserted beach with spectacular sunsets","We stayed at Puri Sari for 4 nights as a base to visit Komodo and Rinca. The pool area was lovely and the beach (although greyish sand and very shallow sea) stunning - empty with amazing scenery. The hotel accommodation was comfortable and stylish, the staff lovely. The sunsets were jaw dropping. Puri Sari is a few km from the town centre but the hotel shuttle was always available and free. I was sad to leave such a stunning setting. The only let downs were the attention to detail in cleaning the rooms (dirty tea cup, mirror and sink not cleaned)."
"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","mrrfrost","Hong Kong, China","Very relaxing place","The Puri Sari definitely isn't a 5-star resort but is a very realaxing place to spend some time.The hotel is a few km outside of Labuan Bajo town so usually need to take the hotel shuttle bus each way which costs 25.000 Rupiah every trip. You can call them when in the town and they will come and pick you up.The room was large and had a big alcony looking out onto the well kept gardens.There was a decent swimming pool with an assortment of sun loungers around it and 4 more loungers on the beach, however there weren't mattresses for many of the loungers though the small shop by the pool handed out towels. The little cafe sells soft drinks and ice-creams. The pool only has two steps going in to it and can be a bit of a drop and there is no signs saying how deep the pool is. Need to be careful if have kids.The sandy beach is pleasant but nothing special but as there are hardly any other people here it can be very relaxing. The beach faces west so the sunsets are amazing. The water here is not clear..maybe because of the sand type,The breakfast was average, some bread and eggs brought to the table from a choice of three menus.If the hotel just paid a little more attention to details this could be a wonderful resort. Just a few signs of wear and tear that could easily be rectified and give the resort a polished feel.There was free wifi in the rooms and in the restaurant.If you want a couple fo days with few other people around...this is a pretty good choice of hotel."
"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","Y1964oung","Gunnison, Colorado","A peaceful place to pause","The Puri Sari Beach Resort was a wonderfully relaxing place to recover from an awful Perama boat experience. Sylvester, the manager, and the excellent staff have taken the advice from past TripAdvisor reviews and from their own feedback system to improve areas that were once lacking. The restaurant was great. In fact, we preferred their food to the highly ranked Atlantis Spanish Restaurant just down the beach. Breakfasts were varied and huge. Coffee was good. The hotel did not charge us for our few trips back to town and helped us arrange a boat to go to Rinca. We would suggest looking at the boat the day before as we decided the first one arranged was not going to work for us and took a slightly larger and much safer one instead.We also enjoyed their new beach chairs and table on the beach and caught some terrific sunsets there during our three day stay. The bed was huge, the air conditioner great, and the room very large. It would easily fit a family of four!"

"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","Michaela N","UK","Great place to gas off after a dive trip","Those HUGE beds covered in crisp white linen and the serene pool are so welcoming after 6 days on a dive boat. Puri Sari still has that small hotel feeling: rooms are spread over two floors only and overlook landscaped gardens and the sea beyond, staff are friendly, and you still suffer the odd power cut. But we enjoyed breakfast on our balcony every morning, listening to birds singing and waves in the distance, and made full use of the laundry service and complimentary shuttle to the harbour area for lunch and dinner and trips to see the dragons."

The rooms were of a very good size and the grounds looked nice (didn't have time to appreciate them) and the staff and owner were very helpful.The restaurant offerings were basic, but having eaten in the town itself, by eating at the hotel, I wasn't missing out on much.The staff seemed quite good, but restaurant staff needed more encouragement on their service levels, but overall as a pre or post tour stay it seemed very popular and no one I spoke to had any real complaints - like one said you could always find something in any hotel.I also understand from the owner that she is trying to get permission to open up the beach area in front of the hotel to make that more pleasant and accessible - this is going through the political process I guess with the authorities. The pool area was also being improved when I was there."

It is a couple of kilometres out of town but they offer a shuttle if you want to go into Labuan Bajo.It is set in lovely grounds and the pool is nice. The staff are very friendly and attentive and the restaurant provides good food and drinks at very reasonable prices. I especially enjoyed the grilled chicken with local sambal. The rooms are spacious, the air con works well , the safety deposit box is provided free in the room and the WIFI is free, works in the room and is reliable most of the time.The bed is very large and probably Emperor size. We would definitely stay here again."
"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","Christian K","Dubai, United Arab Emirates","Disappointing","Staying in Labuan Bajo for the second time knowing that this small but wonderful place in Indonesia is still developing, our stay at Puri Sari Beach Hotel was utterly disappointing.We spend 3 nights and 4 days on a boat around the islands in Flores and had been booked into Puri Sari Hotel for our last night before our departure the next day. The hotel is situated 3km out of the town of Labuan Bajo. The first impression was great! Accommodating, relaxed and friendly, clean rooms, air condition, spacious washrooms. The pool is nice but unfortunately there is no mats for the hardwood pool furniture, my parents and their friends had a hard time getting comfortable. The big disappointment in the end was the restaurant and the service. A few drinks (soft drinks and beer) were not available in the afternoon. Knowing that the hotel has paying customers, even for dinner there was no beer and soft drinks available. We ordered soups which came out fast. The water we ordered was served in a sealed plastic bottle without glasses. The main courses took about 1 and a half hours, allthough we were the only guests with one more couple that had just finished their meal. The food was served and placed at one corner at the table. we had to figure out ourselves which dish is what. The food was ok but the service was so sad.The Puri Sari is a great place with a lot of potential, but sadly nobody seems to give a damn about service. Our expectations are not high, especially travelling in this part of the world, but standards should be implemented.I hope the hotel will improve to really play its cards of a well located hotel in labuan bajo."

"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","Sara55","amsterdam","No beach hotel!","Another hotel that has great potential but does not deliver. Calling this a beach hotel is dead wrong. They have access to the beach. But the beach is dirty and there are no hotel services or facilities on the beach. Very small pool area. Staff is timid and aloof. If you just need a place to stay because you plan to day trips or go diving, I would suggest you stay somewhere close to or in town. Since this place is 2 km outside Labuan Bajo you need to arrange transport every time you want to get into town. Rooms and bathrooms are great by the way."
"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","SebastiaanvL","Amsterdam, The Netherlands","The hotel has more potential","We stayed two nights in Puri Sari. The location of the hotel is beautiful with a large garden next to the beach. The rooms are spacious, got seaview and are reasonably clean; we had old blood stains in the bed linnen and several other unclean items. The breakfast is quite disappointing. Instead of the fresh fruit juice on the menu, you get prefab lemonade. The fresh fruit consist out of six little pieces watermelon and papaya. This breakfast is a big contrast with the other breakfasts we have had in Bali and Lombok (also in cheaper hotels). The hotel is situated three kilometers outside the city with nice restaurants (try Mediterraneo). The hotel offers a shuttle service for 25k Rupiah for a one way tour. There is a nice restaurant (Atlantis) close to Puri Sari which should have good food but was closed at the day we wanted to eat there. Therefore we ate at the restaurant of Puri Sari and wouldn't recommend it. We had Nasi Goreng which was the most mediocre we have had in Indonesia.The staff isn't unfriendly but neither acts proactive. When this hotel would upgrade their restaurant and train their staff on service and cleaning skills, this would be a very good place to stay."
"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","Traveler5548","Clearwater Beach, FL","A/C issues during the day","A nice hotel with a few odd points. The rooms are 3* plus a couple of lizards because the bathrooms are open to the outside, making them hot. But the worst part is that this contributes to the inability of the A/C to cool the room adaquately during the day - this plus the large gap in the window that opens in the front did not help the daytime temperature in the room. At night the cooling was adaquate. The hotel staff was great - very helpful and ready to please. breakfast was three choices - American, European or Indonesian - light but adaquate. The dinner menu needs some diversification, but we found adaquate things to eat. Pool by the beach was nice, but swimming at the beach did not look like an attractive option. Internet was good and free. From what I saw, the Puri Sari is one of only a couple of descent places to stay in Labuan Bajo, so do not let the negatives dissuade you from staying here."

Many of the staff were trainees from the Hotel/Tourism school in Ruteng everyone of whom was unfailingly friendly and helpful which totally makes up for their ocasional lack of skills.The overall atmosphere was very peaceful and the building/resort design had some 'soul'.

The huge beds, cool clean large rooms and working warm water shower was very welcoming after a sleepless night. Would give the hotel even 5 star rating for the rooms, especially if you compare it to other accommodation at Flores. The breakfast is not really anything special (and too pricy for what you get), and a look on the menu does not invite for staying for diner. I read the remarks about no shade/umbrellas at the pool. This has changed now: enough shade now for every chair. Hopefully they will also invest in some mattresses for the very hard pool wooden chairs!"

The pool is very nice too, and there's a black-sand beach just beyond the pool area. The beach is not for swimming, though, as it has a muddy bottom.Breakfast was average, not bad but not great. The hotel can arrange transport to town for lunch or dinner, so I would recommend that, rather than staying and eating in."

"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","jilly28","Adelaide","Our choice for Labuan Bajo","We were in Labuan Bajo as the jumping off point for Komodo National Park - like most other visitors, and spent 3 nights at Puri Sari.Although Puri Sari has the look of a resort it's really not that big, two stories and approx 11 rooms; so don't be put off. The rooms, restaurant and grounds are all very spacious (huge really), and we found we often had the restaurant to ourselves.It's true there is no beach at Puri Sair, but there is no beach anywhere in Labuan Bajo.There are other places to eat close to Puri Sari (1 resto right next door) without going into town, and depending what you're looking for, they may suit you better than the expat/backpacker places there.Of all the hotels we saw both in Labuan Bajo and on the road to the SW where Puri Sari is situated, we didnt see any we would have preferred.From a tourism perspective, this is the Bali of 25 years ago and the Lombok of 15 years ago - the locals haven't quite worked out what it's all about, which has its up-sides, westerners are a bit of a curiosity and everyone says ""hello"".Puri Sari have bikes (2) for rent and we rode out to the Batu Cermin caves, less than 1 hour - worth a look."
"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","joeblitzflick","San Francisco","They shouldn't get to say ""beach""","Options for lodging in Labuan Bajo are quite limited and fall into two categories. Backpacker type places that have transcended that market and are pretty classy, and big sterile hotels built by outsiders hoping to get in on the ground floor of the Flores boom. This is one of the latter. It's very clean, rooms are spacious and tidy, bathrooms quite acceptable even to picky western standards. Grounds are landscaped, but not very well. The pool has a scary green haze to it and very little in the way of poolside amenities (6 chaises longues, two umbrellas). So it's not a resort, it's not on any kind of usable beach (to get to water's edge you have to go outside the property and cross a dirt path strewn with cowpies -- and once your'e there, the water is brown and uninviting, the beach is strewn with litter). Restaurant serves up decent fare, but it's quite overpriced. And the menu is just weird. (It seems not to have been finished; several items are followed by the phrase ""insert brief description here""). We stayed here after 3 days on the road in rural Flores, so frankly, it's like an oasis of creature comfort, and I""m happy to be here. But it's no luxury resort. It works very well as a way station for the main attraction of Flores: Rinca and Komodo islands and the isolated villages of the interior. Of course the people working here are wonderful, polite, friendly, helpful. Mostly freshly graduated from the food and beverage or accomodations curriculum at the local tourism high school, so their speeches are a bit klunky."
"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","Anokhi10","Salalah, Oman","Lovely Oasis in Dusty Labuan Bajo!!","The Puri Sari is a nice relaxed hotel with pretty grounds and a nice pool. The room was huge and very clean, as was the bathroom. Its a nice oasis to go back to as the centre of Labuan Bajo is dusty and not very attractive. To be honest, cant imagine why you'd be in Labuan Bajo unless you're diving/snorkelling etc. as the town itself has nothing really to offer. The downside of this hotel is the location. You are not in walking distance of anything really and need to rely on the hotel shuttle which costs 25,000 IDR for each one-way journey. To be fair, the shuttle was easy to organise and we usually just asked whichever hotel/bar in town we were at to call the hotel for us when we were ready to leave and the driver would collect us so in that sense the location is not a problem.One downside is that there is no real shade around the pool area - it would be good if some umbrellas were put up. Also, there were very few loungers - just 4 plus a wooden bench. You did get pool towels though and the staff in general were very helpful & friendly. Breakfast was good too.Our stay was not as peaceful and relaxed as we'd have liked but this was the fault of fellow guests rather than the hotel. Unfortunately we were there at the same time as a group of about 4 couples travelling together and each of whom had at least 3 children. They completely took over the place and it was chaos from morning till night with the children shrieking and yelling and drumming on the restaurant drums continuously. The parents weren't much better and they made the hotel a miserable place to be for all the other guests.In LabuanBajo itself I'd recommend The Lounge and The Corner for food/drinks. Also, Bajo Dive for scuba diving."
"Labuan Bajo","Puri Sari Beach Hotel","2","Ian Raymond C","Bali, Indonesia","Friendly, simple and quiet!","Puri Sari Beach Hotel is a simple hotel but also one of the better hotels/accommodations in Labuan Bajo, Flores. It is a pretty new establishment so still fresh and clean.Our price of USD55 per night included airport transfers both ways, and a moderate breakfast. The room had air conditioning and hot water but nothing else. All 11 rooms face the beach so the views are nice. There is an upstairs restaurant opened till about 9pm serving a simple menu, cold beer and arak (local spirit) cocktails where you can also watch the sunsets.The staff are very friendly and happy to speak to guests so the atmosphere though quiet is nice.The hotel is isolated like the others on the strip and there are no restaurants close bye and the centre is too far to walk so you really need transport that is quite hard to find. A motorbike will cost between USD7-10 per day rented from the hotel staff and a self drive care about USD60 per day, not cheap!Labuan Bajo, it's beaches and the surrounding area is very much a low key destination but there are a few places in town where the food is reasonable and there is a little weekend entertainment. Two places to recommend are the Paradise Restaurant & Bar on the hilltop and The Lounge Grill & Bar in the centre of Labuan Bajo."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Just_Febrian","","Perfect location","Good value for money, I was in beach view room and it was great view from the balcony. You can enjoyed sunset from your room.

"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","jennak954","London, United Kingdom","Decent room but that's where it ends","My room was comfortable and had everything I needed (although the shower pressure wasn't good at all) however the rest of the hotel wasn't nice at all. From a distance the pool area looks very nice, however up close the whole restaurant/pool area is grim and grimy and has a severe fly problem. You cannot sit outside without being bombarded by very persistent flies. I read reviews about the breakfast being dismal so I knew not to expect much. Words cannot describe how bad it actually was. You get better food in hospitals. On top of the terrible food, before you sit down the whole table and placemats are blackened with the flies waiting to get their share of your food. It beggars believe how so many customers can complained on TA about these flies but management still fail to do anything about them. I hope management read these reviews and do something about the undeviating complaints. "
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Maydina F","","The best view in Labuanbajo and value for money ","We stayed there for 4 nights and we had the best view from our balcony especially during the sunset. Hotel need to pay attention on details like room and garden maintenance, but for the price we paid we can't really complain. Breakfast is always on time at 6am, they even provide us a free transport to airport. Pool is nice and clean but they always don't have staff around to provide towels or clean the pool and area. But overall we are satisfied especially for the price that we paid, we are definitely will come back."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","JH L","","Good clean hotel near beach","Considering the price, this is a pretty good hotel. There's a beautiful swimming pool and beach view. If you wanna go to the beach, it's much better in the morning. Breakfast is quite nice too. It take about 20 min walk until city center. So it's not bad to take a walk instead of a ride."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","kiwikct","Sydney, Australia","Lovely view ","Hotel looks modern, it is clean and tidy. Has great views and pool. Shower was set up for a midget, we had to keep asking for toilet paper and for bar fridge to be refilled, they have not quite learned how to service the hotel rooms properly yet. Staff were helpful and trying hard to please. Menu was very limited and breakfast buffet did not include any western food except toast and jam with fruit the rest were Asian dishes. The island is a great place to visit so the Hotel was a good choice and accommodation is limited and I will come back."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Rebecca B","Perth, Australia","Stunning view but hotel needs a bit of improvement","Location: It's about a 15 minute walk into the main part of town where all the restaurants, bars and dive shops are. It's not too far or complicated but the heat makes it feel a lot further! La Prima will drive you into town for 50k per way or if you can ride a scooter hire one from the hotel for 50k half day or 100k full day.. So much easier! I actually preferred this location rather than right in the middle of town as the beach was nicer than the main drag. Of course there's rubbish on the beach (as mentioned in other reviews).. part of that is just how Indonesia is but it would be great to see it a bit cleaner. Rooms: The best thing about La Prima is the view - definitely get a sea view room if you are staying here! We booked on booking.com for AUD$88 per night for an ocean view room including breakfast and for that price we were happy. Comfy king bed and pillows. Cable TV channels. Cold aircon. Some maintenance required e.g. our doorbell didn't work and despite us telling numerous staff it never got fixed. Hotel: The breakfast has a lot of room for improvement. Some ok Asian dishes but not much Western food. On the last day of our stay a waitress asked if we wanted eggs freshly made - not sure if this was meant to be offered all the time but it's the first we heard. Would be great to have a sign on the tables to say you can ask for fried/scrambled eggs. The room service menu has some good Asian dishes (the seafood glass noodles are nice) and well-priced but the Western food isn't great.. e.g. 50k for a handful of fries!The pool looks beautiful and has an infinity edge to that stunning view of the ocean however the water is too warm to swim in it which is a shame. It might be because it's so shallow (1.4m I think) that it heats up too quickly in the day. The swim up bar is also not set up which doesn't surprise me as no one really uses the pool. Overall, I would stay here again for the view and the fact that there's not a lot of hotels in Labuan Bajo but don't be expecting the same level of quality and service as you would get for a similarly priced hotel in Bali. "
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Tom_Stub","Vienna, Austria","Hotel was really ok","I don' t understand the negative reviews, it's about expectation! This is a very remote location and considering this the standard of the hotel is really ok. Good location, nice view, clean, nice pool, etc. Ok, the Wifi doesnt always work and the breakfast is not the best, but remember where you are! And how much you paid - so dont expect European Four-Star standards.Anyway, LB is not for a long stay but the starting point for a boat trip to Komodo and snorkling/diving, and this is 100% recommendable. Just don't let yourself be talked into a boat trip by a taxi driver. We have been overcharged for a 3D/2N boat trip for 8,5 Mio. without a guide and a crew with no English. The boat had A/C, the food was excellent and the cabin ok, but for a trip like this we found out later that in the low season you should not pay more than 6,5 Mio. which includes an English speaking guide."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","bluepondfrog","Bandung, Indonesia","A good room, outstanding pool","First, let me preface by telling you that Labuan Bajo, the primary entry point for visitors to Komodo National Park, is a dump. The airport looks decent, but driving through town to get to the hotel reveals that Labuan Bajo is a poor, dirty Indonesian backwater without a lot going for it except for a port and a national park. Lots of poor, unemployed looking males squat around the main loop, Jalan Soekarno Hatta.Tourist dollars from divers and komodo dragon watchers have caused a few notable spots to sprout up out of the woodwork. Laprima is one of them. Although not luxurious by any means, this hotel is outstanding given its location in a shantytown. The room was clean enough and quite comfortable. Sunsets, as others have mentioned, were amazing over the harbor. The pool was surprisingly great (among the best I've ever used). Breakfast was just mediocre - not great, not terrible, and there were quite a few flies. I asked for a room on a higher floor (for a better sunset view) and was told that the upper floors were being remodeled. Funny, because I knew for a fact others were staying up on 6 and 7... lies by the front desk?It's low season and it shows. We stayed 4 nights and spent the first two days out on boat trips into Komodo, but the third day we took a break and stayed around town and the hotel pool. Most of the day it felt like we were the only people at the abandoned hotel. Pretty depressing. The staff was just sitting around looking bored most of the day.Paying Rp. 50.000 per trip (one way) into town really got to be a pain, so I rented a scooter for the day (Rp. 100.000). Drivers weren't always ready or available, and I just lost my patience with the transport system.Don't waste your time with the ""beach"" in front of this property. All the trash and debris from Labuan Bajo have cluttered in front of the Laprima making it completely unusable. Stick with the nice pool, or better still, take a boat to some of the better beaches within the National Park. There's still some garbage, but not nearly as much as around Labuan Bajo.Air conditioning great. Wifi usually pretty good.Use this place as a jumping point for day trips into Labuan Bajo. Come with low expectations and you will be pleasantly surprised."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Regina G","Trinec, Czech Republic","Nice hotel for a short stay","We went to Labuan Bajo to make a trip to Rinca island and see Komodo dragons. It was after one month traveling around the Indonesia, sometime being in such poor areas that finding any decent accommodation there was just impossible. We stayed in Laprima Hotel for 2 nights and it was very pleasant ending of our trip. Nice and clean room with a big balcony giving beautiful sea-view, hot shower (what is not common in Flores), beautiful hotel area, good service (transport from/to the airport) and helpful staff (sometimes too young and unexperienced though).If you plan to stay in Labaun Bajo just for a few nights to make some exploring or snorkelling day trips to Komodo national park, then I can highly recommend this Hotel.But for a longer stay, try to find other place. Hotel beach is dirty, bottom of the seashore is not sandy or coral, but rather muddy, breakfast is quite bad, and you can also strongly feel that the hotel lacks visitors.Enjoy your trip :)"
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","RaraBunga","Makassar","La Prima can be better","The hotel itself is in a good well maintained conditioned. Clean, well equipped. Bed and pillows are excellent. I would suggest you to take the sea view room from which you could have a magnificent sunset view. Staffs were friendly but quite inefficient like when we asked for car (several times) from hotel to the city, our order would be processed when we showed up and waited in the lobby while we've called from our room 15-20minutes before.The pool is great. The hotel needs to start to clean the beach in front of the hotel. It was full of garbage. This makes La Prima less attractive for me to comeback because i prefer those hotels with a cleaner beach (i can find great pool anywhere but not great beach) because afterall, beachfront is the one of the hotel's selling point. No point of staying in a beachfront hotel when i couldn't swim in the beach"
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Elżbieta P","Gdynia, Poland","With great potential but disappointing","It is located 10-minute drive from the centre, which is both an asset and a drawback. The surrounding is peaceful but you have to either pay for a hotel car (50 k Rp) or walk every time you want to get to the town/port.The hotel is relatively big and seems to be popular with local people since almost every day there were big organised groups there. Some of them were very noisy not only in the evenings when they were having dinners with karaoke by the pool but also until late at night, which was nuisance for us as we had to catch a boat early in the morning every day.The swimming pool was amazing with lots of wooden sun chairs around but there were no mattresses so it was very uncomfortable to lie on them.The beach in front of the hotel is beautiful. However, it was always full of rubbish. We saw it being cleaned once only (during 7 days).For breakfast there was nothing of European style and we didn't expect it so that was fine. However, although we like trying different kinds of food and we like Asian food and also Indonesian cousine, we couldn't find anything for us among all those deep fried dishes.Overall, the hotel is rather run down and it needs some lifting as well as better maintanance.We had a sea view room and the thing we liked best was the magnificent sunset views from the balcony.````"

LAPRIMA hotel is a below average hotel situated in a convinient part of Labuan Bajo. The staff is very polite and even if you are not a resident of the hotel you can have something to eat or take a swim in the big swear mming pool they have. The best asset of this medium hotel is its location. It is located in a wonderful beach and the swimming pool is in a very small distance from the beach.If you go for a swim you will definitely want to walk on the sand and marvel the sea.But No!! No no no!!! Why no? Because the insensitive uneducated owners don't give a damn about the surroundings of thei property. The beach and the sea outside of the hotel is so dirty and covered with thousands and i am not exagerrating thousands of plastic bottles and any kind of trash. You cannot even wet your feet into the sea because whereever you step you step on trash.It is such a shame and a disgrace to be in such a beautiful place and suddenly you realize that people who do bussiness there have no respect for the environment or their clients.It is heartbreaking to arrive there and see all the stuff doing irrelevant things and sea the seaside and the sea so dirty and polluted that words can't describe!!!!Somebody should remove their license because this is the only way i think that the idiotic owners will learn to respect their clients and the environment!!!After my last visit there and my attempt to walk into the sea i left disgusted and furious!!!Shame to the owners whoever they are!!!

"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Beth L","","Potential to be excellent....","We stayed here with our 2 children and had a 8th floor, adjoining rooms. The facilities at the hotel were great and the room set up was absolutely perfect however it was seriously let down by the service, standard and lack of attention to detail. It had everything you could every want from a hotel but..... a lot of it either wasn't open, didn't work properly or was just downright dirty/sloppy.... Slow and unpleasant service at the desk, the check in staff were yawning throughout. When we went to our room, which were excellent as I said, one of them had not been cleaned so we had beds all disarranged and dirty towels and crockery everywhere. Good enough they did respond to this immediately and the room was cleaned straight away. The view from the sea view rooms was breathtaking and staying here was worth it for this alone..... It was about a ten minute drive from town which the hotel would take you to but for a charge of 50,000 IDR each way (£2.50), which was expensive given the distance but they would come and collect you as well. The pool was beautiful and has a lovely sunken pool bar, which would be awesome if it was open, but it was just an empty space. It has an infinity edge which looks out to the sea which was stunning although it wasn't quite full on our first day. Next to it there was a spa and a dive/boat centre. We attempted to use both, the dive place was good and we used them to do a speedboat trip to Komodo Island on our second day which we enjoyed. However the spa was a big disappointment. We had been travelling Bali and the islands and I was really looking forward to some pampering while in Flores as for once we had spare time waiting for flights. I went into the spa, which said it was open, to enquire about a pedicure only to find the young girl inside asleep on one of the beds and all the lights and air con off. She struggled to communicate with me, having just woken up, and simply pointed up towards reception when I said I would like to organise a treatment. Shocking service and most certainly didn't inspire me to use the spa even if they were willing to take me in....! Breakfast was dreadful, shocking selection of food, what was there was not good. Mainly Asian choices with only a small box of chocolate curly things for cereal and some bread if you wanted a western option. Awful juice and thousands of flies. Saying that, the setting was stunning, it was on the lower floor of the hotel and was open, looking onto the pool and the sea beyond. I think this was also the restaurant and maybe the bar but I never fancied dinner there and we had room service on one evening instead. The food was limited but what I had was quite nice. Again the potential to be amazing was there as they had tables around the pool overlooking the sea yet it all wasn't very inviting so we opted for our room with an even better view. All in all, we did like the hotel as it gave us everything we needed and we would stay here again and recommend it to friends. However, I just feel that it could be so much better with a little more attention to detail, better, inviting (open?) facilities and better service, which I felt was very lacking. A great shame really but OMG, the setting and the view is to die for.....! Worth it for that alone......."

"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Alex J","Athens, Greece","Disappointing, given its price","We stayed for 6 nights at Laprima hotel and though the hotel has many many shortcomings, its sea-views are its one redeeming feature. Location: located on the beach, slightly outside town (about 10 min. walk on the main road – a bit dark (take a torch) but safe to walk. The hotel provides a shuttle car to/ from town, but it charges 50.000 IR (approx 3-3.5 Euro) for each way, which is a high price given the distance (the taxis are even worse, they ask for 100.000 IR). The hotel should really consider offering a free shuttle service (especially given the fact that it does not provide sufficient entertainment and dining options itself)Airport pick-up: The hotel had notified me by mail that they would pick us up at the airport – but when we arrived, we could not see anyone holding up our names. Then suddenly, we saw a young man with a sign stating a different name but also the name of the hotel. We approached him and though he had not been informed of our arrival, he agreed to take us along with the other guests I was picking up (after I showed him a print-out of the email). The transfer back to the airport was unproblematic.Check-in/check-out: unproblematic.Atmosphere: completely lacking.Beach: the hotel is located on a long stretch of sand that is, however, extremely littered. Unfortunately, the beach in front of the hotel is cleaned only in the morning – by noon, the sea has washed up litter and dirt and the beach is uninviting. In the afternoon, swimming becomes difficult owing to the receding waters (tide). Besides the receding and polluted waters, the many fishing boats next to the hotel make swimming even less attractivePool: big and stays open till late; unfortunately, there is no shower which results in many people first walking on the beach and then transferring the sand into the pool. Unfortunately, the pool bar was not operating and neither was the restaurant by the pool. Unfortunately also, the hotel offers only few beverage options to be consumed by the pool (and does not send waiters to take orders or offer menus).Room: Definitely invest in a sea-view room (the mountain-view means a view of the parking lot) which offers possibly the best view of the Labuan Bajo bay in the whole town. The room was of average size. Only two sockets, not close to bed. Safe; bathrobes; complimentary slippers; coffee/tea. The freezer in the mini-fridge was completely frozen over. There was no mosquito repellent for room (and hence quite a few mosquitoes even though we were careful to always close the balcony door. Wifi only sometimes worked in the room.Bathroom: 2 towels per person, some stained; complimentary toiletries included shampoo/conditioner, shower gel, toothbrush, cotton buds (no body lotion or conditioner).Cleanliness: the floors were not mopped properly – we spilled some water and when I took paper to dry the floor, the paper was brown. The cleaning crew also did not clean up the balcony every day. The cleaning crew also does not seem to understand what the sign ‘Do not disturb’ means – despite it hanging outside our door, they knocked twice within half an hour asking whether they could clean the room.Breakfast: a huge let-down. Some Asian and some Western dishes that were not tasty; food items are not accompanied by signs that show whether they are suitable for vegetarians/ vegans; no egg-station, only sometimes pre-cooked omelet (that sometimes contained ham); some pre-cut fruit items; juice was not fresh but artificial. Cups were often dirty.Staff: friendly – but not always capable. We had asked for transport to town for one early morning the night before, to join a tour to Rinca island – but when we arrived at the reception, the driver had departed with some other guests and we had to wait. Price: not value for money"

Nicely located on the edge of town, beachside and with a lovely pool area, La Prima's rooms boast some of the finest ocean views I have seen, with super sunset views to-boot. Our only criticisms are that the restaurant food is over-priced and the beach can become littered with rubbish depending on the ocean currents. Nonetheless this is our accommodation every time in Labuan BajoSimon Staniland"

Also the room we could not fault. It is spacious, clean and fully equipped. Until you decide to go for a bite:The food is very bad, the staff is inattentive, uninterested and the tables are dirty and messy. Also, the breakfast is just as miserable. The buffet is barely refilled when there is shortage on food, the equipment is dirty and the staff remains invisible. Outside there is a pool, but there are far too few sunbeds and what there is, is usually ""reserved"" by brutal, antisocial guests. The beach is narrow and very dirty. In addition, it is full of boats, so swimming here is not an option. Striking was that the coconut trees near the pool are not harvested. If you lie in the wrong place, you run the chance to get a coconut on your head. Perilous!In itself it is an excellent opportunity to sleep, but use your meal somewhere else in Labuan Bajo."

Given the last minute call, we hadn't high standard expectations and we are always happy to enjoy any situation, but this hotel has an unacceptable quality-price ratio; it's a new modern structure with a lot of contradictions (beautiful and comfortable swimming pool with dirty and ripped towels, wide spaces and bedrooms with non-working air condition, a wonderful place for having breakfast in front of the ocean with an often dirty restaurant, an excellent room cleaning service with awful laundry facility). Staff is absolutely really kind, but not always able to manage simple requests such as a cab to downtown (even if booked in advance) It's located in an amazing place in front of the ocean, but the beach next to the pool is full of garbages, a real pity because this place would be a paradise if better managed.Btw I recommend this hotel for family but let's be prepared to pay more than the service offered!"

Facially: Pool and garden are nice, rooms (Standard Hill View) are fine – standard of an European two star hotel, but clean. Breakfast has some choices however rather bad presented. Internet did only work in the lobby, there however fairly quick (Skype calls possible). As the rest of Labuan Bajo is honestly on a low standard, this seams to be the most “luxuries” option. If you, however are on a tight budget, you can find an equivalent for half the price (without a beach). Transport from the hotel to the centre costs 50’000 – however you will find easily a motorbike outside on the street for 5’000 (day)/ 10’000 (night)."

"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","DanielStassen","Bali, Indonesia","For its high price tag, it leaves a lot to be desired...","*** In summary: don't stay here, unless management tackles many of the issues addressed in this review. Instead do yourself a favour and stay at the Bintang Flores Hotel. It costs about the same and you get what you pay for ***Although I frequently travel around the world, I've never felt compelled to write a review. However, considering the high level of dissatisfaction experienced during my stay at LaPrima hotel, I feel obliged to warn fellow travellers and hopefully offer positive criticism to the management of LaPrima whom I hope will take my comments to heart and improve in many areas.Firstly, I must tell you that I've stayed at all the hotels in Labuan Bajo in the Rp800,000 (roughly equivalent to $60) range in the last two years. Therefore, I can offer a unique perspective compared to other similar hotels in the area.Please note that the below comments are based on my perception of what a hotel at that price should be able to offer its guests.Areas needed much improvement:(1) worst breakfast in Labuan Bajo. You can generously improve by providing fresh croissant, bacon, and more Western type food (e.g. baked beans, etc ...)(2) Poor service. During my stay, the majority of the staff was high school students doing a short internship as part of their final high school year. It's great to provide this kind of opportunity to them, but I having them do most of the work, with poor language, training, and experience, is not a great idea. Moreover, I would give more freedom to the staff to take decisions to better accommodate customers' needs rather than saying ""Sorry, we can't do it"" all the time.(3) Price. Rp500,000 per night would be more what your hotel is worth at the moment. If you want more than time, then focusing on improving the quality of your hotel is essential.(4) Internet. If it's to provide internet that doesn't work 99.9% of the time, best not provide any internet at all. This would save people endless hours waiting for webpages to load. Disappointing.Would I ever come back? Sure, if the price is Rp 500,000/night."

"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Char030588","","Bearable","Stayed here for 2 nights and after the first 5 min in the room, I couldn't wait move to Puri Sari. At first glance, room looks fine until we started noticing how dirty the room actually looks. There were many wall and bed sheet stains. The tables aren't even wiped clean, there were coffee powder stains on the coffee making counter that seems to have been left uncleaned for quite a while that they have already solidified and had already toughly adhered to the table. There were dead flies and mosquitoes that are squished and stuck onto the side tables. The towel they placed in our bathroom the first day were also full of stains. The room really felt disgusting to me. Shortly after we checked in, we called the front desk to request to housekeeping informing them that we did not find the room clean. The front desk staff sounded surprised but sent housekeeping personnel never the less. However when we got back, the room appeared the same way. The dead insects were still sticking in to the bedside tables, and the shiny stain of whatever substance was still there below the TV. Please see the photos I posted for your reference. The hotel premise doesnt look bad and i think it looked good in its early days but its definitely poorly managed and maintained. Theres green stagnant water at the ponds hence the maaaany mosquitoes in the hotel premise. I have a feeling the management is minimizing overhead costs coz apart from the poorly maintained room, service and facilities, I noticed that most of their hotel personnel are male. The front desk staff also perform driver, bell boy and house keeping duties. They are nice but they do not exude any sense of hotel hospitality. Plus, the hotel does not offer free shuttle service to the city unlike Puri Sari."

Our room wasn't even directly next to it or opposite side of it, we were about 15 meters away, so that was quite frustrating.The restaurant was very disappointing, the food wasn't good at all, after the first breakfast we never returned and went to town instead, and the service was bad.

The food was adequate and reasonably priced although the included breakfast was a little 'thin'.The views and sunset is gorgeous.What does leave a question mark is the grounds......they seem a little unkempt with green water in some of the pools ( Mosquitos?). This not a genuine resort providing all amenities efficiently, at least that is my impression, but it is value for money while waiting for flights or to pick up a liveaboard dive boat. Do not need to book taxi service at airport, walk outside and there will be any number of folks willing to take you for 50,000 rupiah ( less than 4 dollars). The port is walkable but the hotel can arrange transport......there is a one way system so it seems longer to get there by car."

Bed rooms were a good size but ours had the air-conditioning unit fitted directly over our bed, so you woke with a raging headache! Breakfast was very basic but okay, as was the wifi (slow but worked most of the time). Biggest problem was the pool area. Pool Bar is permanently closed and there were no umbrellas or shade of any kind and the sun loungers didn't have mattresses (lots of people wandering around asking for mattresses!), so you had to lie on wooden slats, frying. The pool was full when we arrived early afternoon and consequently had a nice swim but later that day workmen started digging holes in the pool deck! The following day we went for a swim in the morning and discovered the pool two thirds drained. We had words with a reluctant manager who did eventually move us to another hotel (Bintang Flores - £6 per night cheeper and much nicer hotel). He didn't charge us for our one night at Laprima.

Yes, I like the view of the sunset from the balcony of room, the comfortable bed, free airport transfer and the friendliness of the staffs, they even gave me free late check out...but major things to justify that this is a 4 star hotel are not compliance:1. The room, it seems no maintenance of the physical appearance, since the wall in my room was like a graffiti, very dirty. The water pressure in shower room was lousy, no wifi at all, even though they said they have it. And they didn't change my bed linen during my stay there, even though there was obvious spots on it.2. The breakfast, taste so so, not many choices, no significant difference on the menu for my 5 days stay and the thing that really annoying was they go the extra mile to mix the apple juice with so many water that it wasn't the juice anymore, just water with apple scent.3. The beach, soooo dirty, full of garbage, this was not acceptable for a 4 star hotel4. Ants problem. They seemed to have problem with pest control, you could find ants everywhere within hotel premises, inside the room so you couldn't put anything on the table (even a glass of plain water has ants), in restaurant (table place mat, sugar bowl, even inside croissant), terrible..so, would i recommend it? i will have to say no."

If you're comparing the two (they're right next to each other): PROS: - It was definitely cleaner- Ability to cancel if necessary - Robes, slippers, and some extras provided - Quieter: less locals and tourists stayed here- Bell hop helped with bags- Transit to and from airport/other location is FREE for check in and check out - Balconies in each room- sea view is great- Wifi marginally more reliable, but still spottyCONS: - Breakfast was way lamer. Hot dogs, chicken nuggets, and watermelon? I wanted fresh fruit and Indonesian food, not an American picnic - Front desk staff just as indifferent and unhelpful - Still tons of bugs- wear bugspray! - Cardboard, stiff bedsGiven the swamp-beach and the dirty pool, there's not much to do on this resort. Their food was very limited and not very good either, so we walked to town everyday (20-30 minute walk to heart of town, or 50K Rupiah via hotel shuttle) and booked a tour for the next day to go off Labuan Bajo. My big complaint about the rooms was the sheets and all towels were very clearly stained. We had them change the sheets because the first set was so obviously dirty. The second ones we just tolerated. Some towels even had huge holes in them... time to update. There's not many options in Labuan Bajo, but if you want to island hop and crash here at the end of the night, this is probably one of the better ones- relatively speaking only."

It is about a 15 min walk to the restaurants and bars in town, but at night it's best to take the hotel van for a small fee (reserve your return trip before you depart). The staff is helpful and speak good English. Rooms are modern and clean. There is wifi throughout the building, usually best in the lobby. The lobby is spacious and attractive, but the restaurant downstairs is very plain; breakfasts there were OK though. The grounds are nicely landscaped and include a large pool and adjacent bar. It appears that they're working on a walking trail up the adjacent hill.This is a convenient starting point for traveling in West Flores and Komodo/Rinca. There's a beautiful view of the bay from the upper rooms. Don't come here for the beach though--stick to the pool. The hotel's small stretch of beach is very narrow, and they've done an adequate job of cleaning it up. But as soon as you cross the property line to the adjacent park, the beach is an open refuse dump. Much of it is PET bottles which probably float in from the bay, but the bottles which have been picked off the sand are simply piled at the back of the beach."

"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Milano78","Milan, Italy","Maybe the only modern hotel in labuanbajo","I've to be honest. Laprima is an eco-moster,a high, white, cement tower on the coast of Komodo National park. Notwithstanding this Laprima is modern, clean, comfortable, maybe te only modern in Labuanbajo.Room have the right size with a nice view on the bay. During the night you can enjoy stars and the lights of boat in the bay. There is a big swimming pool (I didn't use). To go to the city centre by feet you need 15 minutes and I suggest you to enjoy the walk cause the cost of the transfer to the city is very expensive compare to the average cost of taxi and transportation in Indonesia. Breakfast is included, and it's quite good even if most of food is asian style also in the eaely morning. This is not a problem for me cause I prefer eat local but if you want to chose there is few!"
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Brenda W","","Westerners will not like","Airconditioners were not cold in either room we tried. Staff was content to lead us to a room that was still being cleaned and we waited 45 minutes in the hall for the cleaning to be completed. Breakfast was very bad, even basic eggs were old and cooked Indonesian style and not to western standards. We moved to the Bintang Flores 1/2 kilometer up the road"
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Jessica B","Jakarta, Jakarta Raya, Indonesia","Good Location","I chose the hotel because it was the nearest to the town and I think it was the right choice. It was far enough that it was quiet and relaxing, but close enough that we can walk to town for food. The facilities was standard, it's not five star, but it is clean and functional. We had a beach facing view, very recommended as the views were fantastic. The breakfast was so so, not very many choices and food quality is not great, would be better to walk down town and grab breakfast at the local Italian warungs. The swimming pool was not bad, quite relaxing and again the view just makes it worthwhile :)"
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Yuriadi","Jakarta, Jakarta Raya, Indonesia","Good Location","The good thing about this hotel is the location. The room itself was okay but not homey type of hotel. It is a good hotel for the purpose of relaxing especially after you have spent a few days of diving or cruising in Labuan Bajo. The food was okay and the staff need some upgrade to match the hospitality of Bali."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Isobel L","Sydney Olympic Park, Australia","Pretty good","Great location and views. Rooms are lovely and clean with everything you could need and everything working. Got a deal on a room which made it worthwhile. I wouldn't have paid the full price, though. You don't get the personal experience here you might in a smaller hotel - which is to be expected - but the service was fine. The breakfast was nice and had lots to choose from. The pool is great. If you aren't taking malaria medication, watch out for mosquitos at dusk around the pool. One thing I didn't realise is that you can't swim in the water at the front of the hotel. Sadly it's full of rubbish like most of the beaches in Labuan Bajo. We took boats out to the surrounding islands which you can organise with Adam who owns the dive business on site."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","silvaubrey","Jakarta, Indonesia","Great, especially if you can get discount","Got a great deal from agoda when I was stranded for a few days in the city with limited budget. It was excellent, good swimming pool, sunset, great breakfast, good transport service (even got some free rides to the city center), WiFi and so on. May even go here again for business trip."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Rubeeee","","Beautiful view, great location","Stayed here twice, before and after a boat trip. It's a nice hotel, clean and comfortable rooms with an amazing view of the sea. The staff are friendly and the hotel provides a free airport shuttle. The town with restaurants is a short walk away. Breakfast was also quite good. I would stay again if I was visiting Labuan Bajo."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Ruben L","Brussels, Belgium","Beautiful sunset","We stayed here after our 2 day Komodo tour with Perama.The hotel was a part of the package. It is nice hotel with great ways to relax ( pool, massage, beach)The sunset is amazing!The restaurant is however not of the same standard. It was ok but really overpriced."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","misflopes","Coimbra, Portugal","Overall a reasonable hotel, but forget about the beach!","We stayed 3 nights in this hotel. For us, the best of the hotel was the spectacular view from the room: the hotel is just by the sea and the room had a large window overlooking the wonderful bay of Lanbuanbajo and the surrounding Islands. It has also a balcony from where it is great to enjoy the stunning sunsets. In front of the hotel there is a small beach but it is very dirty, with lots of rubbish all around. There is even a drain dumping on the sea next to the hotel. It would be a great improvement if the hotel management took care of cleaning the beach. The sea also had rubbish floating. It is not a place for swimming and to enjoy beach time.The lack of a usable beach is partially compensated by a large and nice pool surrounded by pleasant gardens. But also the pool requires a more careful cleaning: there was a green layer of algae or/and lichens all along its inner walls. Moreover, there were few shadows around the pool. The room was large, the bed was fine as well as the bathroom. Everything was clean and well maintained. The room was very quite. But the best of the room was the view and the balcony!Some staff did not speak English but others did and they were extremely helpful and friendly. They helped us a lot in trying to get our luggage that had been lost in the intercontinental flight to Jakarta. They were really nice.The hotel is isolated, at 20 min walking distance from Lanbuanbajo village. Alternatively to walk, one can take the hotel shuttle, which costs 50,000 Rp each way. The breakfast was very poor. The only fruit was melon, the choice of western breakfast items was very limited and the coffee was not made freshly from coffee beans. The food at the restaurant was also on the poor side.Overall it is a reasonable hotel taking into considerations the alternatives existing in the Labuanbajo, although pricey for Indonesian standards."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","StMarkCH","","Okay but don't expect beach holidays!","We (young couple) use the hotel as a base for exploring the Komodo Park.The room was clean enough with good sanitary installations and a magnificent room from the balcony. The pool is clean and well maintained, the breakfast buffet is abundant.Just be careful if you expect to swim in the sea or even walking at the beach because it's a waste dump (what a shame, so close to Komodo National Park). Hopefully they will start a proper waste disposal system im Labuan Bajo soon...As base for making tours by day and using the swimming pool just briefly whe returning from the tour: 4 starsAs beach resort: 1 starFinal rating for our needs thus 3 stars"
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Basawake","Arnhem, Holland","Probably the best in Labuan Bajo","When you ask a taxi driver (if you can find one) to take you to the best place to spend the night, you might end up here!Laprima has a great swimming pool and garden to lay back and enjoy the great weather, sea and sun set!The rooms are clean, spacious, have sea view and wifi is available throughout the whole building. Bathroom is spotless, great shower and shuttle service to city center (5 min). Staff is great and very friendly. So why does this 4-5 star hotel is not getting the full 5 points it might deserve?Starting the morning for breakfast you might want to forget a buffet you would expect. Coffee is not fresh and not coming from beans. Fresh cream is not available, it will be milk powder. Expect tea to be (very) black. Fresh fruit is available if you like melon as that is all they have. No cappucino, no bacon etc. Rooms are simple, aircon not adjustable (at least not in my room 308) and also my phone was not working. Ordering room service is possible, but a menu is missing. Laying at the pool is great but the stretchers are made of wood. Looks nice, but its hard to relax on such a hard surface. The Spa was closed during my stay. Also the diving shop was not in operation. I would come back next time, but there is room for improvement!Shuttle service cost you Rp 50.000 to the center. Expect another 50.0000 to get to the airport. Harbor is 20 minutes walk from hotel. Great place to eat are Made in Italy and Mediterreaneo. Dive shops are all over. We had a good time with both Wicked Divers & Manta Rhei. "
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Brusselslady","Brussels","This could be a good hotel, but ...","The hotel has a lot of potential :- spectacular view on the bay and the surrounding Islands- Nice swimming pool and gardensBut the hotel is really underperforming due to lack of maturity of the personnel.- they are very young and inefficient at the reception- wrong invoicing- prefer to chat amongst them instead of working- no eye for customer needs and definitively no eye for detail- no full cleaning of rooms ( at first sight clean, but under the beds ...)- breakfast limited, one little oven (half broken) for a big hotel ...- orange juice very watery (more than usual)This could be a very good hotel if someone with experience and management capacities would make work of it. If it continues as it currently is, we fear that this will turn in a mediocre hotel very quickly."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","paolo0760","Florence, Italy","good hotel, wonderful location, ugly beach","Before getting there, reading comments from other travelers, we were a bit concerned about this hotel. After having stayed there 5 nights, here our feedback.Hotel is an a very nice location, with spectacular sunset, 10 minutes walk from LBJ downtown. The structure is visible from far, but it is not as bad (and impactful with surrounding nature) as we had read... it is a sort of 7-8 floors swiss chalet, almost fitting with the hills around.The reception is large, pretty clean, the rooms are pretty good as size and cleanliness.The swimming pool is very nice.Breakfast are decent even if not huge... organization of food and queue can be improved. However, we had one dinner and one lunch, with a good level of satisfaction.What is really bad is the condition of the seabeach, full of garbage in a not tolerable way. It is a real pity that such a nice place is strongly impacted by th elack of care of boththe hotel and the town administration.We overcame such an issue making daily trips to the islands around LBJ (Kanawa, Rinca, Bidadaru, Kelor...), really really nice."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","AyuAstuti45","Bali, Indonesia","Stunning View","We stayed twice at this hotel in this year, there are some points that I need to say here, which is good part and what's need to be improved.The good:1). The hotel is close to the airport approximately 10 mins by car, normally you will have free pick up transfer from the airport.2). The room we had was Sea View as I could remember it was 5th floor. Its amazing view, once you open your curtains...you can see directly the ocean and its always good to enjoy the beautiful sunset at your balcony. I always love this part☺.3). The room big and clean4). Awesome infinity swimming poolThe things that need to be improved:1). The food was not that good and the service too slow, they even forgot to serve our order.2). The staff doesn't speak English well and not really hospitalize. 3). The swimming pool need a bit more attention as we saw it wasn't really clean the last time we visited.4). There is no internet connection in our room, so we have to go to the lobby if we need internet. 5). They will charge 50.000 IDR for drop off service to the city or harbour which is about 10 minutes walking distance. Would be better if they provide free shuttle bus with specific timetable for in house guest.6). The beach are dirty. We found plastic, wood and bottle rubbish floating along the beach in front of the hotel.So, basically we were happy with this hotel because of the stunning view, besides these comments in the hope that the management will improve their service for guest satisfaction."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Peter P","Adelaide, Australia","Overall it's good. It is modern and generally clean and tidy, BUT...","Overall the hotel is good. It is modern and generally clean and tidy. But as often seems to be the case in Indonesia, it just doesn’t quite make the grade because of a few minor short comings. Things like the “sticky” restaurant tables that the staff haven’t wiped-over with a damp cloth for a long time. The scuffs marks on the room walls - a professional fresh coat of paint would be a big improvement. A regular clean-up of the beach front and for heaven’s sake, give the swimming pool walls a clean… they are meant to be blue not green! Having said that, full marks to the housekeeping department. The dusty window sills were wiped clean after I left the curtains wide-open for them to see."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","RGBez","Dubai","Nice hotel but not amazing","I stayed in Laprima after several bad experiences further into Labuan Bajo. It was a relief to be in a proper hotel with clean rooms, AC and a nice hot shower.... Not to mention NO MOSQUITOS! The groups and pool are lovely although the pool needs a good clean as does the beach and the breakfast was a little rushed and lacking in variety. This aside the staff were helpful and friendly and the airport transfer is really handy. I would stay here again if visiting Flores."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Muhamadian R","Jakarta, Indonesia","Good hotel for transit","The hotel is quite close to the airport and only about 10 minutes walk to Labuan Bajo downtown hence quite convenient. The staff were very helpful, the room is quite spacious and clean. We were given the room at 6 th floor facing the sea and view is magnificent especially at sunset. The management of the hotel should pay more attention to the cleanliness of the beach at the front of the hotel which was unclean with many rubbish scatterred around. I see Labuan Bajo as the next Bali and I believe the management should also step-up the training of the hotel staff so they can also be world class."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","SarahMI_2012","Singapore, Singapore","Pleasant beachside hotel with a wonderful view of the sea","A standard hotel, with knockout views of the bay and nearby islands. A quick hop to the town centre - then again, since Labuan Bajo isn't huge, that's not surprising.The wifi didn't work while we were there, though."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Reisglad","Oslo, Norway","If you get the promotion rate - run for it","If you can get the promotion rate at 750 000 rupies, run for it. This new traditional high rise hotel (nine floors) with a great swimming pool with pool service and towels at the beach just outside Labuanbajo centre, is extremely good value. The rooms are straight three stars hotel rooms and comes with balconies with a fantastic view over the bay. Service in the hotel is very friendly and good - including pool service. The room is cleaned dayly. There is 15 minutes to walk to Labuanbajo center, or you may use the hotel service at 50 000 rupias each way. Good breakfast included. The food in the restaurant is good and not more expensive than in the centre of Labuanbajo. There is nothing particular to the hotel - may be the monkeys in the trees around. It is just nice, peaceful, and friendly. Where else do you get this hotel quality for 750 000 rupies? Very good value for money. Negative: Allthough the swimming pool is great and cleaned regularly, they tend to forget to clean the walls of the swimming pool which is coloured by green algees. Allthough the hotel is right on the beach, the sea is so full of garbage - even though they try to clean the beach in the morning - that you will prefer to swim in the pool rather than thread in mud and swim among plastic cans and everything else that is floating around in the ocean. Unfortunately, a general Indonesian challenge."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Patrick G","Hoofddorp, Noord-Holland, Netherlands","Great value for money","Great hotel, just outside the the village. View is fantastic, just make sure you book seaside rooms. rooms are not 4 star, but great considering the price. Restaurant offers a nice choice of food, but if you stay for a longer period, a bit boring, no specials. The pool is the best thing, fantastic for kids. All in all a great place to stay. Hotel car into town costs 50k Rp. One way."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Kindermans","Grembergen, Belgium","Not recommended, but where else to go?","We stayed here 2 nights in order to be able to visit Komodo. The hotel is located at 15 minutes walking distance from the dirty town (?) of Labuan Bajo and seems to be # 3 in the Tripadvisor list. If this is the case, I wonder what the quality of the other hotels is. We had a room (508) with a double bed and a see view. The balcony is a great place to see an awesome sundown. The room was spacious, acceptable clean, but worn out. After the first night, upon our return from Komodo at 4.00, the room wasn't yet cleaned. So far for the good things.Staff is friendly, but all act as school kids. They think that the hotel is a playground. Plenty of staff, hanging around, doing not too much.Restaurant menu is very limited and dishes get 1 star for quality and content. You better go to the italian restaurants in town; I recommend the Osteria del Mare.Breakfast is a disaster. Filthy, limited in availabilities ... a kind of : take some 'food' and get out of there as fast as possible. In one word, I think that the hotel needs a Manager who knows how to run an hotel. If well run, it has some possibilities."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Soturkey","Istanbul, Turkey","Mistake","Other than the sea view, it is a terrible hotel. I booked a double bed room, and they gave me two single beds. When I told about this to the management, I was told that they were out of double beds! After I complained, they told me that they can give me a double bed with no sea view, which is definitely a downgrade! Then they sent people to my room to move me out to the room with no view. Considering that the hotel does not have anything to offer but the view, this is a major disappointment. Also the towels are stained and the AC which is right above the bed blows air on to the bed and drips water on the pillow! Staff do not help at all, I wanted to book a trip to Komodo Island at 7:45, they made me wait for 30 minutes, and told me that they can't book it from the hotel after 8! Terrible hotel, bad value for money..."

Wonderful view of sea, gardens and pool.Unfortunately the beach area was filthy full of rubbish, that no-one seemed ever to clean. Clean Bedding and towels every day. Lots of student training staff all young teenagers.The reception staff did seem to be more efficient and qualified and helpful.  The town / village was about a 15 min walk. There was a shuttle service which you did need if you went into town at night. The town was full of rubbish and the rain gullies full of filth its a wonder no-one is seriously ill. a couple of hundred years ago London England was also full of rats filth etc and there was a plague outbreak., There are some quite nice places to eat, the Lounge has a good atmosphere and music.

Pool view and sea view made my feet won't go anywhere until sunset done. the room is cozy with balcony and warm staff hotel whom always smile to the guest.

The beachfront is covered in trash and the rooms and hotel are extremely dirty. The food at the restaurant is horrible. I didn't even want to eat the breakfast I bought. The spa is a joke where a massage is being covered with a beach towel on a small table and having cream violently rubbed over your body. To top it off the service is bad. It seemed like the entire hotel was being run by teenagers who didn't know what there were doing. I'm sure there are much better, cheaper options."

"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","April O","Las Vegas, Nevada","Great stay with wonderful pool/view","I was very hesitant about staying here after reading the reviews, but after staying 6 nights I can say that it was a perfect hotel to spend almost a week in Labuan bajo. Pros:1. The air con worked perfectly. 2. There is a fridge, tv, toiletries, nice bath. 3. The hotel is a 10 min walk from a decent sized store that sells beer, snacks, milk, bread ect...4. There is a hotel shuttle that is easy to arrange that costs 4.50$. The shuttle is free to and from the airport.5. The staff at the hotel were always friendly and smiling.6. The view was spectacular and the pool was huge/ clean/ amazing! Cons:1. The main con would be that the city itself is not very nice2. The beach in front has trash, but I would recommend taking a boat to nearby kanwana island to snorkel. Overall I found it difficult to find info about Labuan Bajo prior to going so here are a few things that might help you.1. The best food by far is at Made in Italy restaurant. 2. We could find everything that we needed at the local store( diet coke, diapers, wine) 3. We were able to rent a boat to take us to Rinca and Kanawa for 100$ for the day through the tourist office in town.4. There are tons of dive shops in town that will take u on a day trip to the best spots in the Komodo National Park for 100$ for 2 dives. 5. If you are sensitive to dirt don't walk around town. It didn't bother me, but there are parts that u smell/ see sewage and maybe see a rat or"
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Athomp08","Atlanta, Georgia","Utterly disappointed..There has to be somewhere better to stay","I do not have many nice things to write about this hotel except that the location boasts a beautiful sunset and that the building itself seems to be well constructed. Beyond that, I reckon the owner ran out of money and did everything else on the cheap.The following were unacceptable at this $70 per night hotel:- Dirty rooms and linens - blood stains on the bedding and towels, soiled sheets, filthy walls- Breakfast buffet with flies swarming- The hotel is staffed entirely by teenagers. It seemed as if everyone of them was in training and did not quite know what to do. I had the bell boy walk into my room un invited after I opened the door to inform me of a tour we were interested in booking.- No visible management and formal process to file complaints (See previous comment as everyone was a teenager)-overpriced and hardly edible food.... do not eat dinner here. Walk down to town and eat at one of the it Italian restaurants. Pros- beautiful sunsets"
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","catspyjamaz","Barcelona, Spain","Great option in Labuan Bajo","This was the first hotel we stayed at in Flores and can safely say that this was probably the best accommodation we had the entire time; mainly because of its room amenities which may not be available in other hotels in Flores such as air cond, hot shower, room service, hair dryer (upon request), tea making facilities, safe deposit, a nice and clean toilet that doesn't smell, TV with western programs n free wifi. The room is quiet, clean and comfortable and the service was good for most part. Labuan Bajo is pretty rustic and still up and coming but they are working hard so for the price you pay, please don't expect hotel room standards equivalent to those in Bali or Phuket. Tip: A trip to town by hotel taxi is pretty expensive but is doable on foot if you have the time and energy. Around a 15-20 minute walk will get you to the street where many of the dive centres and restaurants are. As you are exiting the hotel, turn left and walk down all the way."

The food was very good, especially breakfast. Rooms were nice too. Price was very reasonable. The hotel shop had almost nothing in it, so they are missing a chance to make some profit here. Travellers' needs, local crafts, etc. could be there. Wifi was available in the lobby and restaurant. Any modern hotel should have it in the rooms too. The coffee maker had no coffee packets or tea anywhere we could find."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Jill_Dublin_12","Dublin, Ireland","The view & pool area are unmatched!","We loved this place. We arrived early & the staff had our room made up as quick as possible. We were served a refreshing welcome drink & explored the beautiful pool area - not a sinner in sight!The room itself is large, comfortable & clean. The toiletries were impressive - sewing kit, shaving kit etc. The balcony complete with table & chairs was perfect for viewing the impressive sunset. Ask for sea views & a high floor, chances are they will accommodate you.The staff were, for the most part, excellent, would do anything to assist you. We had food at the pool which was absolutely horrendous! Even worse, it was left out for so long after we had finished it that ants started raiding the plates. Orders weren't taken so we had to run inside every time we wanted a Bintang. The breakfast wasn't great either.The spa was OK - I had a pedicure which was fan but my manicure was terrible. The lady who works here is very lovely but the quality just wasn't there.The pool area is top class - more like 5 star if they had the service & appropriate sun loungers (the loungers are old, wooden & uncomfortable). Great view, infinity pool - beautiful! There is a cheap shuttle service to the town & we booked our tour to rinca through the hotel reception which was absolutely out of this world & inexpensive!Overall, would stay again & highly recommend."

And that was just the only thing good about the hotel, a bed to sleep in. To far from town to walk, some times we had to pay the hotel for a ride, and some times not, like the staff did not know what the procedure was. Staff promised to come back and help us with the safty box, because it was locked, they never did.The hotel was a bit worn down, towels with stains on. Very small breakfast buffet, not that good, an they ran out of things early. Dinning menu very small, same price as eating out, tasted okay. The beach up to the hotel was very dirty, and the sunbeds hard with no padding. The internet do not work that well, almost only in the restaurant.The hotel was in the cheap end, guess you get what you pay for, would thoose another hotel if we ever go back."

We had a room high up which was great to watch the sunset and the boats coming into the bay so if possible I would suggest requesting this. I got some great photos from our balcony and walking along the beach. Watch you do not leave ANY food out in your room (I left a bottle of OJ partially opened - whoops) and we had a serious aunt issue.The pool and lounge chairs were amazing! A nice place to relax from the backpacking we had been doing and enjoy a cold drink. They did have other drinks but we mainly stuck to some cold beers. The breakfast buffet was decent for us (we had waffles for a treat) and had quite a range of choices! The other menu items were a bit pricey but we often took a shuttle to eat at the funky and really great restaurants in town (like a 5 ish minute van ride). We walked back from town once and I would recommend a flashlight as it gets dark quickly.The wifi was inconsistent in our room however our friends sleeping next door did not have any problems.They provided shuttle service, welcome drinks and were generally really accomodating (we wanted to switch to an Ocean View Room). They even coordinated our day trips to Rinca Island & Snorkeling with other couples at the resort so it would cost us less.I was happy and I would definitely stay here again given the price and service we recieved."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","amz155","Toronto, Canada","Meh, it was okay","We decided to splash out a few nights and moved from the budget Gardena on town to La Prima. Can't say it was very good value to be honest. It was nice that they had a pool and the view was good. But the room sucked. We woke up sweating at 11pm as the AC broke and they tried to fix it and then moved us to another room (but parking lot view). They told us we could move back in the AM but when we asked they said the AC wasn't fixed. No apology, nothing. Then they lied and said that all the other sea view rooms were taken. Clearly this was not the case as the hotel was pretty deserted at the time. As for all the complaints about breakfast...not sure what that's about. Breakfast was decent enough. We walked to town for dinner for better food options. Was about. 12-14 minute walk but bring a headlamp or flashlight.Luckily we got a discount rate via Agoda otherwise I would have been pissed to have spent so much money on a room."

Pickup from the airport was invaluable as you can get a bit mobbed when you step off the plane.A welcome juice was a nice touch. We had a room on the 5th floor which had awesome views across the bay and made for an excellent sunset! Room had all the essential modcons, wifi was a bit iffy in the room but usually worked ok downstairs. The best bit of the hotel is the pool area looking out across the bay! Also the buffet breakfast was great!Restaurant food was expensive but tasty. Another good point was we were allowed to leave some luggage while we went to a nearby island to snorkel and do the komodo dragon trips- which saved us a lot of hauling around in the heat!"

The hotel staff was ready for us at the airport, assist us with our luggage, the transportation was ready and cool when we board, reception at the hotel was great, check in process was a breeze, in no time we were showed our room and voila the view from our room sealed our group approval of satisfaction. Bed is good, bathroom with shower, ac is working, breakfast was ok, really no complain. This hotel served its purposed well as a transit hotel for us."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Rebecca T","London, United Kingdom","Great views, poor service, awful food","The hotel has great views, but that is pretty much the only thing going for it.Very few of the staff spoke English, and we were standing at reception for a long while before the staff even paid us any attention.The room was basic, cheap fittings and furnishings. The bathroom light did not work, and the shower was little more than a drizzle.The restaurant and breakfast selection were appalling. The papaya presented for breakfast had a maggot in it, and when we ordered from the restaurant we had to send more the half the dishes back as they were inedible.Not recommended."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Sune S","Bangkok, Thailand","Great hotel in Labuan Bajo","As many other travellers have noticed the view from this hotel overlooking the sea is superb. Considering that you are really in the middle of nowhere I would consider this a very good hotel and it would definitely be my choice of stay next time I visit Labuan Bajo. It's close to the town which is only 10-15 minutes walk away and from where one can arrange day trips to Rinca or Komodo islands. We only had 2 nights there but next time I would consider staying a little bit longer. The are is good for diving too though we only did snorkelling."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","susagani","Jakarta, Indonesia","Nice view","I recommend the hotel because it has nice view of the bay and located very close to the better restaurants in Labuan Bajo. The rooms are nice. The breakfast is very basic. They could serve better coffee as Flores is known for its coffee."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Rachel V","San Diego, California","Nice Hotel, Great View","Very nice hotel, nice staff, great view, 15min walk from town.

"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","dubai_UAE_traveller","Jakarta, Indonesia","As expected for Labuan Bajo","Went for a diving trip to Labuan Bajo which is most recommended. The hotel is basic but close to town centre (if you can call it that).Room size is adequate. Bathroom good enough. But breakfast is a mess. Food very basic and coffee terrible. Tea had the same colour of the coffee, which is the reason why i did not try it.Swimming pool is nice and not many people around. Sun beds available but hard and unconfortable as not mattress available for it. Transport is available at IDR50,000 per trip which is a lot. Than again there is not alternative. Staff friendly and attentive. All-in-all not a bad stay in an amazing scenery."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","TouringM","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Friendly staff and clean rooms","We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights on two separate occasions. The rooms were clean and bright. The staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful. On the first night the air conditioner did not work well. They gave us another room to sleep in while they tried to rectify the problem. The next morning we moved back to our room and the the air conditioner worked fine.Breakfast was a buffet and it was ok. There were quite a lot of flies in the dining area but staff kept the food/fruits covered.The hotel has a nice swimming pool and a beach in front. However there was a lot of rubbish around the beach area. It was an eyesore.The location of the hotel was a bit out of the town. One can walk to town in about 20 minutes or take a hotel car (Rp 50,000 one way - quite pricey) or get an ojek (motorcycle - Rp 10,000). It was quiet and a respite from the dusty and chaotic town area.Overall the stay was pleasant. The hotel offers free pick up from and drop off to the airport."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","kayb413","Dartmoor National Park, United Kingdom","One star for the pool and the other for the sunsets....not much else...","After five months travelling this sadly has been rated as our worst stop....we booked for nine nights as a dragon base but mostly as a quiet last few days before our return to England. After one night we tried desperately to change our flight return to Bali as soon as possible! The pool and views, especially the sunsets are fabulous, but sadly not much else. Our room was tired, needed a lick of paint, the sink bowl was cracked, the balcony railings rusted and not looking too safe, the air con box on outside wall sported completely exposed wiring. We had to constantly ask for toilet paper, coffee and creamers. The food has to be the biggest let down....the breakfast buffet consisted of very watery juice or water, very sweet bread not good with eggs or if you dare the occasional dried up frankfurter. Indonesian food was the majority on offer which invariably was cold, or luke warm and nicely dried up at the edges. Melon was the only fruit which if you were lucky may have been recovered with cling film from the heaps of flies....why other guests don't respect others enough to recover food I will never understand. There were plenty of staff around, usually not doing much that could have easily been utilised to maintain the breakfast fly free. The pastries were very fatty and defrosted frozen with a nice plain flavour except when you hit on the odd raisin! The made to order eggs were going to be the highlight if the chef knew how to cook them....three try's at boiled eggs, the first being an already hard boiled re heated, the second (asked for five minutes) had very runny whites, yuk the third great .....except they tasted very strongly of FISH! Ooooo not nice. The sunny side up fried were crispy on the bottom, yolk cooked solid but the white see through runny on the top....how did they do that? The beach would be beautiful if cleaned of rubbish...the Bintang Flores up the far end of the beach employs someone to daily clear their area of beach, however, what is picked up is piles to the far end or on the back edge of the sand still in full view....the Laprima said their clean up programme only covered a once a week clean.....there was rubbish stuck in sand rocks and shallow water that had clearly been there for a lot lot longer than a week. We even witnessed one guest trying to encourage the not so busy staff to pick up plastic everything's off the beach to much avail! So in a nut shell be prepared, ok this is a reasonably new tourist area and with that in mind you can expect a few teething problems but looking back at other reviews we cannot see much enthusiasm to correct the many failings....oh and one big one, no cushion mattresses for the sun beds, it's no wonder hardly anyone lies around the pool for long even though this is the best bit.Having said all of this the visit to Rinca Island has without a doubt softened the fact that we couldn't leave for four days (no flights available) ..... Made in Italy Resturant a must while your hanging around. Last moan the hotel provide a car into town which because of the poor food you will need to do, but they charge you way too much for the two minute journey of 50 INR so if staying a few days definately hire a scooter."

"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","mindythelion","Vancouver, BC","Decent place, basic hotel, beautiful pool and sunset view","Next door to Bintang Flores, Laprima is a nice hotel with friendly staff and is a good place to stay while in Flores. It's far enough outside the town that you need to use the hotel cab or rent a scooter, but it's right on the beach and nestled into a rock hill with a hidden trail leading to one of the most beautiful viewpoints we discovered on our trip. The continental breakfast was very good (eggs, fruit, coffee, local treats, and Asian cuisine), and our favourite thing to do in the evenings was watch the sunset while floating in the pool. The rooms were very standard but the AC was nice and room service came quickly. We stayed at both Bintang and Laprima for two nights each; if you're torn between the two, choose Laprima."

"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","DiveJedi","Amsterdam","Excellent hotel - friendly staff - beautiful pool","We had an excellent stay in this hotel. Very friendly and helpfull staff. Very nice and large room with a beautiful view. We stayed on the 8th floor - room 810 and wifi worked perfect.They have a beautiful pool with nice garden. There is a nice beach - only at low tide though.Restaurant staff speak english very well and try their best to offer a good service.At breakfast you can order eggs in any style you like. Before I booked I read a lot off comments about this hotel that were negative, but probably these people are used to staying in the Beverly Hills Hilton. Considering this hotel is in the middle of nowhere they are doing a great job. To earn your helpfull vote : the hotel does offer a car service to town for 50.000 rupia ($5), which is a bit expensive. So walk into town once and rent a motorbike for 75.000 /day. Then you can do groceries and go to dinner in town whenever you like. I rented mine at Life is an Adventure for 4 days for 65K per day.And tip #2 : Have dinner at Made in Italy ; wonderfull Italian food !"
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","willgo79","Edinburgh, UK","Could be great, but isn't","This was one of the more interesting places we stayed on our 6 month trip. There is much to like about the hotel, but unfortunately even more that needs to be improved.The best bits are the views and the pool. We were on the top floor and the sunset view was stunning. I do like a good sunset and this is easily in my top 5 ever. If youre unlucky enough to have a mountain view, the sunset is almost as good from the excellent infinity pool. The room was also nice, a decent size with a balcony.The rest though leaves a lot to be improved. I think most of it is due to the newness of tourism in LB so hopefully with time and training this will improve. I'll stick to the short list of low lightsBreakfast was shocking - Danish pastries were the best thing on offer, but I think the hotel got part cooked frozen pastries flown in and had them defrosted instead of cooked.Lunch wasn't much better - chewy, bland rengdang curry. We didn't bother with dinner on any of our 4 nights so always had to trek into town (2 miles / 10 minute taxi away)The shower in the ensuite is fitted at an insanely low height. I think most likely whoever fitted it had never seen a shower before.They offer a $5 transport service into LB but this was hit and miss, often requiring a long wait. On one occasion, the driver sent to pick us up drove straight past us then didn't return until we called. It turns out he didn't know the dive shop we were at but didn't think to ask!The level of english spoken is also very poor, it often took many attempts to get our message across.... that's just the highlights!Overall, I'll remember this place for the views and the pool while trying to forget the service!"
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Amanda Z","Chicago Ridge, Illinois","Great Pool and nice stay outside of town","My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night after we did a 3 day liveaboard in Komodo. It was nice for a one night stay - the hotel's free shuttle picked us up from the dive shop after we returned and also took us into town for dinner. They also drove us to the airport for free which was great. The hotel is a bit outside of town and is about a 25 - 30 minute walk and 5 mins by motorbike. We could not get a car taxi after dinner so just beware you will need to walk (which some parts are pretty dark) or get a motorbike ride. The pool is very nice and large although I do agree with everyone that the lounge chairs don't have padding so they are pretty uncomfortable. The wifi also only works in the lobby and not in the room. The room was large and the bed was pretty comfortable. The shower had hot water and the bathroom was clean. The view from the room's balcony is very nice and you can see the pool and water which was very pleasant. The staff was friendly and helpful when needed. This is by no means a 5 star resort but you are in Labuan Bajo so there are no 5 star resorts, however, for the area - it is more than sufficient for a couple of nights. I would say it is a bit overpriced but most of Labuan Bajo accommodations are expect Golo Hilltop resort!"

You can pick up a bemo from town back to hotel for 20000 rupee.The pool was large and when we used it we were the only ones enjoying deckchairs tables and chairs all set on a local beachfront.We enjoyed our stay and found the standard good considering the location is fairly remote.The staff were polite and we found their English was good enough to understand each other"
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","chris241174","","a bit out of place","This hotel reminds very much of a business hotel, but on a tropical beach! the pool is nice and the room was alright, but otherwise it was a bit out of proportion, everything was a bit too big, and the breakfast really was bad, although there was a mini oven for the undercooked pastries which I read about in another review. There were also 50% too much staff that sat around chatting all the time and although the transport offer was good, it was never quite clear what the criteria were for getting charged or not. it was ok, but overpriced!"
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Enric0G71","Milano","Good option for one/few nights","Stayed here one night after a tiring (but fantastic) three days cruise, and enjoyed resting in the comforts of a western chain style accomodation. The property is quite new, the lobby is airy and bright; rooms are not that big but have all you need (nice bathroom, mini-bar, safe, TV, comfy bed, etc.) with a plus of a balcony with a great view over the bay, especially at sunset. Chosing this hotel is value for money especially when compared to other options, just a little bit cheaper but far away in terms of services and accomodations (i.e.: Bayview Gardens, where I stayed before the cruise - see the review). Swimming pool (and surrounding garden) seemed very nice as well, but didn't have the opportunity to try it. Downsides: 1) bed sheets had some stains, but once called the reception they immediatley sent someone to change them 2) don't go there for the beach 3) it's true that breakfast is not to die for, but could be much worst (...you get what you paid for, isn't it ?) 4) the building is big and, together with other 2 hotels in the same area, have somehow spoilt the originally wild coastline...you may not appreciate it if you prefer more ""ecological"" options"

Don't be! It was great. The location is just a little way out of town but there is a shuttle form the hotel which is reasonably priced so you can go into town for dinner. We were here waiting for out dive boat. The pool is stunning, and there is a tiny beach at low tide but it is easy to swim in the ocean if you want at any time! But the pool is where it is all at.... The rooms are modern and clean. Make sure you get one facing the ocean so you can see the most amazing sunsets from here. We only had a few snacks by the pool and ate in town in the evening. I would def stay here again if i was visiting Flores"

I had a rengdang which tasted like a microwave meal.The sun loungers by the pool are extremely uncomftable.The tours they sell are very expensive.The shower in the ensuite is fitted at such a low height that you have to hold it while you shower! Ours also wasn't fitted correctly so a lot of water was wasted.They offer a transport service into the downtown area but some of the drivers are hopeless!

So we just tried to have a better place to sleep - and La Prima is a good choice.Rooms are simple and comfortable, but noisy a bit - a lot of dogs and roosters comes with garden view. And if you are comparing with sleeping on a Komodo trip boat - that rooms are much better.Personnel is friendly but not all speaking English (but all are trying).Breakfast is not good - but for one night stay it is't a problem.Hotel itself is not in a Labuan Bajo, but again it's not a problem - there is only ten minutes walk to couple of restaurants in a town center.Just good hotel in a village."

"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","L0renza","Dublin, Ireland","Nice hotel, great view, good value","After having experienced a terrible hotel down to the harbor, this place appeared to be like a paradise to us. Infinity pool, great sea view rooms, big and comfortable beds, air conditioner perfectly working and a lot of space: all of that for just a little bit more than the previous hotel downtown.Some things can of course be improved: communication with the personnel was sometimes difficult, breakfast quality was average and so was the dinner and in general the hotel atmosphere was quite 'cold' but we were happy anyway.The hotel is 10/15 minutes walking to the centre; that could be a negative point as you need to call the hotel to pick you up (and always consider a 10, 20 minutes waiting) but at least the shuttle was free (even if I read that other guests had to pay for that, ...maybe we were lucky? . Surely hotels in this area should offer free shuttle to their guests, to compensate the fact that they are distant from the centre)."

So I decided to bite the bullet and stay at La Prima as I was intrigued to see what it was like and I had heard the views were great. Also, I stayed at Golo Hilltop the night before for $45 and La Prima was only $60 a night, for a much better standard of hotel. I arrived and they gave me a room on the top floor facing the water. The room was exceptionally clean and had every amenity you needed. And the view, well, I could have sat there looking at that view forever. And I did, and I took loads of photos. It was just gorgeous. The pool area was lovely as well. I took a stroll onto the beach but I didn't go swimming there - it wasn't as unclean as other reviews here have written but there is still a problem with rubbish washing up on the beaches generally in Indonesia. The only bad thing to say about the hotel is that the food was below par."

Best things are impressive infinity pool overlooking the sea and views from room if you have a sea view. Negatives is horrible service, location out of town, hotel not quite ready. Workmen are still painting, fixing walls, gardens still being planted. Breakfast is a pro and con. Included in price which is great but food in warmers with no heat on so food was cold or slightly warm. Beer expensive comparitively to town and other hotels. Can walk to town easy enough in 15-20 mins if you have to. Shuttle 50000 for return journey which is a little expensive compared to local drivers but convenient. Local restaurants will call for return journey. Food in restaurant is so so - someone said in their review they ate there every day. Lots better options in town for same or less money with better ambience. Service us slow, staff forget orders, ask you twice for room number and pool service is not happening unless you walk up to restaurant and place order personally and keep doing that. Locals are employed which is fine but training needs to be much better. Seems to be no managers which might be the problem. All in all I liked the stay and stayed twice over a week bit look around and compare - don't get mesmerized by the pics of the pool without taking all this into account."

Service was good enough but nothing to leave a great memory of the place.I just wish the rest of the hotel was as impressive as the view.

The hotel has a very nice pool and surroundings. The rooms are not very spacious but are clean and overall OK. The only real drawback of this place is that it has very little atmosphere - especially the interior could be that of any of the generic airport hotels. However, this gets a little beter around the nice pool. The location is on the outskirts of Labuan Bajo - for me this was more of an advantage as I didnt really enjoy the town itself. You will probably want to take a taxi to go to town - it will cost you 50.000 Rupies."

I understand their Asian food maybe nice but even so cold as ..and cold fried food is horrible ,and the bacon ( I'm not sure why they bother also cold and tastes horrible ) I stayed here last year and I'm sure the food has gotten worse ) I must say how ever if you are happy with toast jam and fried eggs then this hotel is lovely oasis .we never left hotel unless to go into tow for meals and shopping as we had just come from Gili Air via big old wooden boat on a four day trip snorkelling and no fresh water ,so hotel was nice relaxing clean spot to lay by the pool . Big thank you to Yani who speaks enough English to book over email and arrange pick ups and drop offs etc ....well done Yani you need a promotion . ( if you get one hire someone who can cook a hot breakfast and keep it warm ) I would stay here again in a heartbeat .but all I really wanted to do was get in the kitchen and show the staff how to do things .but for the price and view and location it's well worth it . We ate at Mediteranio Italian Restaurant bloody beautiful food highly recommend it ...shame the food was so bad at Laprima we would not of needed to leave ( Asian food I'm sure would be nice made to order other than breakfast) you will love your stay at La Prima ...

The staff were helpful, room was clean, and the grounds well maintained. The hotel did forget to clean our room on one night, and the bathroom was not as clean as nice as the rest of the room, but was acceptable.It was a quiet time, so not many guests, but the breakfast was a decent buffet. It is only a short walk in to the town (at the port), where there are plenty of options for food, and tours etc. We did this every day. The walk back was a bit dark at night, and I would get a taxi if I did that again.The restaurant was fine, not hugely over prices and the food was fine.

The pool area is very well maintained, and a great place to relax. My stay was extremely comfortable overall. i would definitely come back.The negatives: Breakfast was below average of what you would expect from a hotel of this quality. far from anything else in Labuan Bajo. It's a 20 minute walk to the part of town with restaurants and shops. They gouge you for money - it's 50,000 rupiah to get transport into town (they take advantage of the lack of transport options), and dinner is very expensive and not very tasty at the restaurant."

Magnificent view from the rooms over the bay (we only paid for a room on the back side, but they upgraded us without any extra charges!). The staff is really friendly and helpful in any way....the pool is awesome!! very good value for money, highly recommendable!! :-)"

Breakfast was inedible possibly the worst I've ever had. But that was it. Decent tv channels & the staff were happy to let us have the hotel room for an extra 3 hours as our flight was leaving a little late. Complimentary shuttle to/from airport is good too!"
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","YnnafFanny","Zurich, Switzerland","great sunset view, quiet","The hotel is slightly outside of town, 20min on foot or 50'000 rupiah if you use the hotel shuttle service (we just took bemo for 5'000 rupiah /pp). But being a bit outside means this is perfectly quiet dyring night and day. The rooms are spacious, including a mini fridge, a safe and a balcony. Make sure to ask for a sea view room: the sunset is fantastic! The inifinity pool is great and surrounded by a well-maintained garden. A breakfast buffet is included in room price, i found the ingredients quality was average despite the large selection. Freshly made omelets or waffles are good though. Staff is very kind and helpful. Internet is available in reception/restaurant/pool areas and free. The hotel can pick-up/drop-off at airport for free. Overall we enjoyed our stay, this was very relaxing."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","crossdon","alberta","Great Komodo stopover","This is a mini oasis on the tranquil ocean setting, too bad the beach is so terribly littered with garbage, it would be a great community project to clean it up and in turn keeping the ocean cleaner. We saw way too much garbage in the ocean and on the beach. However the hotel is a great refuge, comfortabe rooms, we were upgraded without being asked, great TV with lots of channel choices, great infinity type pool, and very,very well kept and clean grounds. The rooms at hotel need a good spring cleaning of window ledges and corners. Do be aware that you are a ways from town and each trip costs INR 50,000, about $5.00 return, this I think the hotel should provide gratis to customers.Staff are excellent, nothing is too much to ask, they are so friendly and kind, we thoroughly enjoyed getting to know them during our stay. The coffee and tea in each room is a very nice.touch.We thought the restaruant prices were high, until we went into town our first night to the Mediterranio restaurant, same prices and portions were so small, we left hungry. Next night we tried hotel restaurant and never ate out again, food was excellent and portions were more than enough, try them first.We would choose this hotel again."

"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","DiariesofaBackpacker","Miami","Awesome hotel with best view in town!","Labuan Bajo is still pristine with perfect location to visit the Komodo dragons and the wonders of the island which is ready to be explored! Most people go to Bali but i strongly believe this island is more beautiful and perhaps the upcoming best thing. And Laprima hotel is the place to stay. Without a doubt the best hotel in town. Its location is hard to beat! close enough to walk to the town but also apart enough to feel you have your own piece of paradise with the best sunset view. The rooms are clean, comfortable and well equipped. The food is great and the swimming pool is amazing, facing the blue sea. The staff will go out of the way to take care of your needs and help you coordinate your excursions either to Komodo or around the island. Strongly recommend it!"
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","DMC4466","Montreal, Quebec","Amazing sunset view!","We had one day to relax in Labuan Bajo before flying out and it was totally worth staying here - at least at the off-season price around 500,000 rupiah for a top floor room and free breakfast. The wifi wasn't working in the room, but it working (slowly) in the lobby and restaurant. Pool and view were excellent. Buffet breakfast was decent too! Enjoying the sunset from our room's balcony was the highlight for me!"
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Swim_butterfly","Santa Cruz, California","Excellent Hotel By The Sea","La Prima Hotel is one of the best hotel in Labuan Bajo. I stayed here during my most recent trip to Indonesia in June (summer) 2012. The hotel in Labuan Bajo which is a gateway to the Komodo Dragon National Park which is about an hour boat ride from the pier. This is a new hotel has all amenities in brand new conditions. One of the best amenities of La Prima is their infinity swimming facing the ocean. The room is immaculately clean and the bathroom is spotless. Internet is only available in the public areas (dining) and not in the room the during the time of my stay. Maybe they have internet in the room by now. The manager mentioned that it is work in progress. I suggest to check with the hotel about the current internet availability in the room. The staff are very friendly and they will make extra effort to make your stay more than you expected. The food was good and they will prepare it fresh for the guest. The hotel is located in a very quiet part of Labuan Bajo and away from the city center which is few minutes drive. I did my first dive in Flores and the hotel manager helped me arranged my activities with the local tour company before my arrival. The check in and check out processes were quick. Ask for room facing the ocean and the pool from the upper floors for a better. The hotel has their own transportation that takes you to places upon request. I highly recommend La Prima Hotel. All is good!"
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Nick H","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Wonderful staff make this hotel","We stayed at La Prima twice for one night each. The staff here are some of the friendliest I have ever encountered. La Prima is a new hotel (opened 8 months ago) so they are still going through growing pains. The rooms are very comfortable but not well decorated. We had sea view rooms with an awesome view all the way out to Komodo. Breakfast is nice with an egg station and a bacon/hashbrown area. Since Labuan Bajo (and Flores) is predominantly Catholic pork is ok. They had a large free dinner for guests on New Year’s Eve with a huge fish, lots of pork dishes and lots of other traditional Flores food. The pool is beautiful and faces the best beach in Labuan Bajo (but this isn’t saying much). La Prima offers a free shuttle o and from the airport and around town, this is extremely useful. I am looking forward to returning here throughout the years to see how La Prima continues to improve with age."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","Ianfinchtgd","","Expensive and cheap","Newish hotel, which seems to have been finished on the cheap, so the furniture is already starting to wear and not a picture or wall hanging in sight. Great for a science lab but not exactly homely.Waited 50 minutes for dinner of fried noodles in the restaurant at which we were two of four customers at 8pm..Checkin was similarly slow.Pool area is nice, but the view is spoiled by trash on the beach next door. And the hotel building itself is something of a concrete block.For the money, this is pretty poor and possibly more suited to Indonesian 'modern' tastes than to those looking for character and charm."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","thecyclingbackpacker","United Kingdom","Beautiful view, great pool","We were staying in accommodation with no pool so decided to go exploring on our motorbike one day for a beach or pool near Labuan bajo. We came across this hotel and asked if we could use the pool. We paid 100000 rupiah (about £6) each but had the pool to ourselves. The hotel was totally empty as it was ""low season"", but we had perfect sunshine until late afternoon!The staff were very friendly, and the receptionist offered us a 40% discount on a room if we wanted to stay. The room was advertised for 1,000,000 rupiah so we could've stayed for 60,000 (about £40) which I think is good value for the quality of the pool, view and the peaceful location.We didn't look at a room so I can't comment on the quality, but it shows that if you travel in low season, you can turn up and negotiate!The infinity pool was clean, large, with a swim-up bar. It had been well designed and built. There was some repair work being done to some pergolas outside which meant there was a bit of noise, but since the hotel was empty, this was a perfect time to do it so we really couldn't complain.We would probably have stayed at this hotel if we hadn't already planned to leave for Lombok that evening"
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","indie_dive","Minneapolis, Minnesota","Nice hotel, friendly staff, good food","We stayed in La Prima in early December 2012. During the day we went diving with Orca Dive Club from Jayakarta Hotel (La Prima just about to open a dive shop). It is a new hotel and the location is quite close to the town but it is still quite a walk from the hotel to get to nice and good restaurants like Mediterano and Made in Italy (20 minutes walk). You can ask for a car from the hotel and it will cost you IDR 50,000 to bring and pick you up (you can ask the restaurant staff to call La Prima to pick you up).The hotel is located quite far from Labuan Bajo Port, so it is quiet and not noisy with boats' sounds.We booked superior room from Agoda.com and get a nice room at 8th floor with ocean few and balcony. The room is clean and spacious. The bathroom has shower bath, no bathup.The breakfast buffet was okay, not super excellent but plenty of choice for Indonesian food, not much on European breakfast but you can ask fried eggs and bacon if you wished too. I personally like their Indonesian breakfast - nasi goreng (fried rice) or mie/mihun goreng (fried noodle) with three or two different other Indonesian dishes like chicken, tempe/tofu, and vegetables. For dinner, I suggested to take chicken satay, it's really good or nasi goreng menu (also with satay).The staff were friendly and helpful. I don't mind to return to La Prima again someday. Dive sites in Komodo Marine Park are spectacular, some of the best dive sites I have ever seen, and I haven't visited all the dive sites yet, therefore if I will return for diving in Komodo and stayed in Labuan Bajo, La Prima will be my option."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","beachbabyNottingham","Nottingham","If you need facilities and want to see Komodo- best choice","Big new hotel. We got a cheap rate but is usually expensive. Good points, lovely swimming pool, friendly staff, clean rooms, good bathrooms excellent shower and hot water. Nice views front- sea, back mountains. Bad points- soul less place not in keeping with the local environment, no atmosphere, very pricey for Indonesia. We enjoyed Golo Hilltop better."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","pauld","manchester, england","Best hotel in Labuan Bajo","Stayed for 4 nights in August 2012. Hotel is the best choice in Labuan Bajo. It's new, modern and has all the facilities you would expect of a 4 star hotel. Breakfast is standard mix of European and Asian fare. Its a 15 minute walk to town or you can take a ride with their transfer service for about £4 return at a time of your choosing. You get a free ride back to the airport. Pool is great and the views out to Komodo National Park are amazing. Beach is not that good and attracts a lot of drift. Only real gripe is the fact that there are just 6 sun loungers for a hotel with over 50 rooms is nowhere near enough. Food ordered off menu is expensive and average. Better to eat in town at the great Italian place called Little Italy. Labuan Bajo is a bit ramshackle, but seeing as you're probably only there to get out to Komodo or Rinca, you're best staying here compared to other paces."
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","rany_budi","Jakarta, Indonesia","A Place to Relax","Laprima Hotel was a wonderful place to rest and relax after an all day trip to islands around Labuan Bajo. The sunset view from the swimming pool were so beautiful with so many colours, and the water was very warm! Unfortunately, the housekeeping forgot to clean up the bathroom and trash can when we checked in. So you need to check first before you used the room. And the service was quiet slow, which slow motion seems to be the main culture of the native people."

Located c. 15 min walk from the Labuan Bajo in a very quiet and peaceful area, offers very nice rooms and a fantastic sea view. Rooms, restaurants (good breakfast buffet and tasty lunch menu) and all other facilities match 4*standards. Friendly and helpful staff guarantees pleasant stay. Fantastic infinity pool offers wonderful sea view and invites to swim, whereas pool surroundings with well-maintained garden are perfect for having a sun bath with a drink. Beach itself is not very nice – quite short and kind a dirty (but it’s not a hotel/ staff fault). Wonderful, quiet and peaceful place for relax. Hotel offers free of charge airport transfer."

The best thing was we were not hassled by hawkers coming into the hotel. This place is about a ten min walk from the main part but we loved it. We got a good deal on booking dot com but had to leave after a few nights as the price went up for the weekend. Oh and the infinity pool is great!"
"Labuan Bajo","Laprima Hotel","3","weloveindonesia","Jakarta, Indonesia","A great stay @ La Prima Hotel","We stayed there for 6 nights and enjoyed it. The hotel just opened last April and the rooms are clean. I think we were particularly lucky as we came during low season (end of September) and we got a very nice Superior room with a sea view. The room was in the middle so everyday we can sit in the balcony and see the sunrise and sunset. It was amazingly beautiful.The public beach directly in front of the hotel would be so much nicer if people won't throw their rubbish in the sea. Every Friday their staff clean the rubbish from the beach, I wish the beach could be clean everyday..Staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast was okay; some days are better than the others. They change their menu everyday. But if you are there quite late the breakfast would be finished as they don't really top it up.Minus point for us is that they should install WiFi to be available for the rooms. As for now, WiFi is only available in the lobby area and the restaurant area - which is quite a hassle if you need to get on the internet. Telkomsel 3G also didn't work sometimes.We also spent our last night in their Deluxe room (bigger room with a bath) but find it not too be as worth it as the Superior room. Deluxe room is not in the middle, it is on the side although we can still enjoy sitting at the balcony looking at the sea and pool area. The bathroom is very weird as it has a see through glass window and the curtain is located at the room's side instead of inside the bathroom. I think they need to fix this part.We spent a few times sitting by the pool area and find that they need to invest more on their sun beds as it is very rough to sit on and they only have 6 sun beds for the whole hotel. I would imagine in the peak season, many people won't be able to sit by the pool. The pool area is very nice and spacious.Pick up and drop off cost Rp 50,000 - there's no hassle. I would recommend to eat in town. Wonderful restaurants: Made In Italy, The Lounge, Medditeraneo.Overall, we enjoyed our stay at La Prima Hotel in Labuan Bajo and would recommend this hotel. Thank you for a pleasant stay and wonderful memories :)"

The deluxe room with the ocean view was great. A king size bed, TV, complimentary tea and coffee were all appreciated. The staff were exteremely kind and helpful. We had a problem with the safety box (our own fault) and it was promptly resolved. The pool is great to chill out and to have a drink. Towels are available and deck chairs too. There was a decent range of food for breakfast, which we enjoyed on the patio overlooking a little fish pond. The hotel offers a free airport pick up and drop off and it costs 50,000 to be driven to and collected from the town - per car - so it works out really well. I found the hotel really really comfortable and staff helpful. I would definitely opt to stay there again!"

They sent us the reconfirmation already and even 2 days before our arrival. On the day we had the tour, the boat was not ready, and they've risen up the price for mostly 2 times than the price that they have offered us (finally they have agreed to accept the price that they have offered for the first time)The next day for our tour to Rinca Island, they asked us to standby at 6.30 am to take us to the harbour for the tour. We were waiting up to 7.15 am nobody came, we asked the front office about our tour, they could not find out our reservation. The manager did not do anything just walk arround like a nut chicken. Finally the lady (Ryan?) has got the seat for 5 of us for the tour. Arriving at the harbour, we just found out HE DID NOT RESEVED THE TOUR FOR US.Please to make sure when you arrange any tour -on the 20th of august on our arrival we came to the restaurant at 8pm, ordered 1 gado-gado (peanut salad), 3 fresh garden salad with thousand island, 3 carbonara pasta and 1 rice with grilled fish, our order ready at 9.30 pm-Having massage with Ms Mila, the bathroom is so dirty with scale and dirts (probably is not cleaned after used before), and she should be asked to turn off the television and light when giving me massage (they use room 318 for the massage room)-The most positive thing is, Mr Linus - the owner of the hotel, is quick to response for the needs of the hotel-The hotel will be great if they can improve their staffs competency to acomodate their guests"

Teddy assured us on a day at 6pm that our trip for the next day was booked but at 11 pm when we were confirming details he scrambled to call and book it as if we had never asked. He then said it was too late to book (previously he gave us an appointment at 730am next day) and then stopped speaking to us.

"Labuan Bajo","The Jayakarta Suites Komodo-Flores","4","AugustoMonteverdi","New York City, New York","Good Hotel for a Short Layover","Other than as a jumping-off point for a Komodo boat trip, the Labuan Bajo area has little for travelers to explore, whether your interest lies in nature, culture, or a more modern pursuit like shopping. As such, there aren't too many options in Labuan Bajo for a first-class accommodation, and the Jayakarta is probably as good a choice as any other ""4-star"" hotels in the area. While the Jayakarta is a ""beachfront"" hotel, the black-sand beach is covered with a thick layer of mud and decomposing leaves and grass, thus undermining any efforts to turn the hotel into a resort and a destination unto itself.The room we had was a standard room with 2 twin beds. It is a clean, air-conditioned room, with huge windows facing the ocean. The bathroom could use some improvement: slow drainage in the shower, and the vanity is way too low--think slightly-above-the-knee counter height. The builder must have thought the top of the vessel sink should sit at where the counter height should be! The staff members are uniformly friendly and pleasant. The service quality is also good if a bit on the ""frugal"" side. Instead of charging us Rp.25,000 (about USD 2.00) for two 1.5-liter bottles of water--a very small amount, really--why not include that in the overall rate already and offer the water for ""free""? It would have given a much better impression of the service. Why not give out two room keys when there are two people in the room? Again, it gives the impression that the hotel is trying to save pennies by minimizing the cost of replacing unreturned keys.Buffet breakfast is included in the rate. The food, overall, is good, although the fresh fruits were disappointing--bland and tasteless. The fruits that we had during our 3-day boat trip were much much better, and the hotel should ask the boat crew where to get the fruits!Love the antique furniture in the lobby! I wish I could take some home."

I would definitely recommend this hotel to other families looking to visit Flores and Rinca Or Komodo. We got one of the suites with a roll away bed. I would spend extra for the suite as it looked much nicer than the standard rooms. It was spacious, clean, and had a lovely view from the balcony. The bathroom was very large as well. The ac was cold and the hot water made it through all 4 of us. The staff went out of their way to be helpful and was very friendly. The breakfast was adequate and since it was included we ate there. There was an omelette station and a waffle station, fresh fruit and cereal and pastries. If you get a chance eat next door at the Atlantis Beach Club. We were tired and ordered room service which was decent but quite expensive. We made the choice to eat in our room as the mosquitos at the resturaunt were very bothersome. The hotel helped us arrange our trip to Rinca at a reasonable price. Finally the pool is gorgeous and my 3 and 7 year old could have played there the entire vacation. We also had an emergency when my son left his lovey and we had to be at the airport in 15 minutes to catch our plane. The staff all made a tremendous effort to quickly help us recover the lovey and we made it to the airport! I cannot stress enough how kind and helpful the staff was and how much we appreciated their efforts. Make sure you bring plenty of cash as ATMs are hard to find and outside the hotel not many places accept credit. I have read some negative reviews and I guess I would just advise families to manage your expectations. You will be staying on a remote island in Indonesia. Looking around the town you will understand that the Jayakarta is absolutely a luxury resort compared to what is offered locally. If we make it back to Flores we will stay here again."

Staff are pleasant and accommodating; rooms have great views of the bay/harbor - curtain no doors for bathroom (not a big deal but an FYI ). Food is very mediocre but you are dining with wonderful views of meticulous gardens and pool area."

For example, they forgot to pick up us from the airport; when we arrived to the hotel, they had not our rooms ready; the room was dirty and the food was very bad. Furthermore, we tried to discuss this service with the manager of the hotel but was a nightmare, it was impossible to deal with her.If you can, choose another hotel."
"Labuan Bajo","The Jayakarta Suites Komodo-Flores","4","Thefreedomtravellers","Sydney, Australia","Pretty average, nice pool area","Stayed here for one night after doing a live aboard for 2 days to Komodo Island. Being able to sleep in a bed and have wifi (although not in the room only the common areas) was a welcome relied. All in all though the hotel was pretty average. The pool setting was nice, and the view over the water was impressive. Without that I can't imagine what this place would have to offer. The rooms themselves were super basic, weird curtain separating the bathroom from the bedroom. I'd say this would be a 3 star hotel, absolute MAX! The brekkie was ok, had a fresh made waffle with maple syrup and some fruit."

From the 2nd floor the balcony offers a great view that reaches the sea and includes the gardens, swimming pool an gigantic chess game. The breakfasts, with a view of the gardens, were very tasty and well served.The hotel provides a free shuttle service to/from harbor, airport and ATM."

Paid for a ""Deluxe"" suite, never has the word deluxe been so misused. The room had no door to the toilet but a curtain also the room was not properly cleaned after the first night. Although it overlooked the sea it had no balcony and was basic in every way. We orders food when we arrived as it was not close to another restaurant, we had to send it back as it was inedible (I have never sent back an entire meal) at least the waiter didn't question this and seemed genuinely embarrassed. Avoid!"
"Labuan Bajo","The Jayakarta Suites Komodo-Flores","4","astriblakeney","Mandurah, Australia","A bit dated & average","Planned to spend 5 nights here in one of their suite rooms but hubby decided to check out earlier since there weren't many things to do at hotel and limited choices of food at restaurant. However they provide free shuttle to the city which is very handy since it is a bit far to the city and there is no public transport. It has a decent sized pool, nice garden, direct access to the beach but unfortunately you can't really walk on or swim in it. It is quiet and perfect for a short getaway (3 days max!) but if you like to stay by the pool, read a book and enjoy cool drinks, it is a nice hotel to stay."

If you are a beach bum and interested in snorkeling I would not recommend it.It brings your mood right down, to see a stunning sunset on a filthy, littered beach- such a shame! SUGGESTION:Beach Boat Bar, clean the beach, sell Happy Hour drinks, sun loungers!"
"Labuan Bajo","The Jayakarta Suites Komodo-Flores","4","Christian B","","Just ok ","They really try, but simple mistakes keep this from being a great experience.First of all, why are there no doors to the toilets in the room? This makes just no sense at all. It would makeup a nicer, and more romantic, stay if you could close the door to the sounds and smells of your wife or kids.Then there is the service, we had a great driver, but the front desk forgot the early morning airport transfer we booked the day before. They also had a bit of trouble with the extra night we booked at the hotel. Three times after I booked it at the front desk, they contacted me and asked me what price we had agreed on. Oh, and when the extra day came, they locked me out of my room, by disabling the key card."

However, there wasn't any beach access and the rooms did not have balconies. The location is quiet but also far from town. Restaurant food is average and prices are high. We were comfortable but non-plussed, especially when the hotel forgot to pick us up, even after I called before our flight the same morning. The prices the travel agent on site have is we're five times the average. It felt like a rip off. I would stay elsewhere next time."

"Labuan Bajo","The Jayakarta Suites Komodo-Flores","4","Ohandtabz","Bangkok, Thailand","Relaxing stay, just what we needed after a week long at sea.","My Wife and I stayed for one night after our diving live-aboard trip in Komodo. We had booked Jayakarta suite as we though we could do with little space given that we will be staying in a live aboard for a week. We were picked up from the pier after giving them a call during the time for our disembarkment from the live-aboard. The hotel is located next to the sea in a quieter part of Labuan Bajo, little away from the city center which we understood was the harbour area. There is not much around the hotel, however the hotel let us know they provided free shuttle which we did not use given that we wanted to take a bit of rest. The check in process was quick and the hotel accepted credit card. Our suite was on the third floor, the room was quite spacious with a large bed and the bathroom was quite big too (we did have a good laugh after staying in a lievaboard this was nothing short of luxury). The view from the balcony was nice as mentioned by others in the review, we could sit there look at the sea and the boats moving by.The restaurant is on the ground floor area, we liked that it was not enclosed, it looked over to the pool and towards the sea, it gave a open feel while having lunch/ dinner. The food menu had enough choices and it was decent. There was less guests in the hotel during the time, so the service was good, though the staff struggled a little in English but they were trying their best to help. We found breakfast to be good too, with good variety and eggs/pancake live counter. We found the hotel grounds to be nice, with a decent sized pool and trees & plants around (which was nice as we saw a lot of different flowers). The beach in front appeared not in use much with a little bit of plant growth and debris from the sea (which we cannot blame the hotel, we were very disappointed to see the harbour area extremely littered with plastic bottles and junk thrown in by the boats, so the the beaches closer to the harbour area will be much less fortunate). The wifi was free and worked decent, my Wife was very happy using internet after a week long absence, uploading pictures of our diving trip on her facebook and connecting with family.Over all we liked our stay in Jyakarta, it was very relaxing, good rooms and good service, just what we needed after a week long at the sea."

Staff are friendly, pool area and grounds are well maintained, food was ok, rooms were in need of updating and a door between the bedroom and shower room needed instead of a curtain.

But, aside from these petty gripes, The Jayakarta Suites is highly recommended, and feels like the height of luxury after a Komodo boat tour."

Nice pool, but not enough sunbeds. Open-air restaurant for nice evening dinners as well as for breakfasts. Room was spacious with aircondition and sea view. Bathroom also was big, but no door, only curtain which doesn't give the feeling of privacy. Maybe it's ok for married couple, but definately not comfortable for siblings or other family members relations."
"Labuan Bajo","The Jayakarta Suites Komodo-Flores","4","Francisco J","","Great service","The hotel is perfect to relax, and a very good point to the tours. You will probably go to Labuan Bajo for the Komodo and Rinca islands, and there is an office of the agency Panorama at the same hotel.Free transfer to the airport and two daily free shuttle buses to Labuan Bajo (drop at 11am and 6pm, pick up at 2pm and 9pm).The best of the hotel is the staff: young, trained, professional. Very good breakfast, menu to have lunch or dinner a la carte a bit overpriced but nice buffet per 120k IRP.I find the rooms quite old fashioned, they could improve curtains and have a door between the room itself and the bathroom. However, there is a door in the shower... Private beach yes, but don't expect a beach where you will want to swim or stay: it's dirty. Perfect place to enjoy sunset."

The pool and gardens are nice. The beach is not good for swimming as it has mud flats. There is a nice restaurant-club walking distance up the beach (The Atlantis). You can negotiate on room rates once you arrive."
"Labuan Bajo","The Jayakarta Suites Komodo-Flores","4","rmorandinideoliveira","Geneva, Switzerland","Frie","despite some mixed reviews, which I only read on my way to the hotel, we had a delightful time at the Jayakarta Suites. Boys enjoyed the lovely pool a lot, not too many people there as most out on day trips. Staff was corteous and friendly without fault. We took two ine day trips to Komodo National Park and Rinca Island with Panorama tours, the tour operator that has an office in the hotel. We had two great days on a big traditional wooden boat, basic but with all necessary ammenities, indonesian food cooked daily and some if the best beaches we have ever seen for snorkelling or just swimming. Tour guide, driver and crew very friendly and accommidaring to our mire than energetic 6 year old son. We made some fantastic family memories on these trips.The only improvement point for the hotel would be the food, its limited variety and expensive for what you get in town. But they have a free shuttle to take you to town where choice is plentiful: our favourites, Mediterraneo. komodo kitchen a abd happy Banana, all as per trip advisor recommendations. So overall a great 4 days at Labuan Bajo, Flores."

We also confirmed directly with the hotel 3 days before we arrived. When we arrived, they had no information about our reservation and it took 15-20 minutes for them to sort it out and get us checked in. Even though we paid for a room for 4 people, the room was too small. They tried to charge us for an extra fold away bed and we had to show them over and over again that our reservation was for 4 people, pre-paid, and we should not have to pay extra for another bed to fit the 4th person. The hotel was going to charge a lot for transportation to the town so we ended up eating dinner there. They staff got our order wrong twice and it seemed like my son's fried calamari had been frozen - he couldn't eat it. Overall, not a great experience. Though our bathroom was quite nice. I wouldn't go there again. Most of the problem was due to poor customer service."

Management should consider to put door on it. The TV channel is limitedBreakfast and dinner in restaurant also nice. The restaurant is open air and facing to the pool. Nice place to sit and relax.

The beach wasn't nice and full of debris/trash. Superior room has no balcony and the bathroom has no door (only curtains!). Breakfast has wide variety and probably better than other hotels. There is also an on-site dive center (Orca Dives) and travel agent (Panorama Tours) that can supposedly arrange diving trip or tours for you, but during our stay the two offices seemed empty all the time.

Sure enough the price of one night stay in this hotel is equivalent to 10 days stay in one of the Backpacking hostels located in Labuan Bajo. Yet as soon as we arrived there, we know that what we pay was worth it!Very clean, sleek surrounding, located 10 minutes from the city centre, this hotels offers a great, posh accommodation for guys who prefer a more lavish option whilst staying in Labuan Bajo. We ordered one double bed room with two people and a beach front view, all not too shabby for ~$70/night. At first the aircon in our room doesn't work, and the tropical heat of Labuan Bajo tortured us but the hotel was kind enough to accommodate our needs and move us to another room. The food is a bit pricy but great nonetheless. Overall it was worth the price!"

"Labuan Bajo","The Jayakarta Suites Komodo-Flores","4","docdot","London, England","Outstanding staff, comfortable suite with great balcony & sea view plus nice pool & food. Amazing hotel for this region","LocationHotel is located about 15 minutes from the local airport by car and about 5-10 minutes drive to Laboan Bajo Town & harbour. The hotel is on a long road that has various hotels in vicinity (but this hotel is only 5*) plus a snack store about 10 minute walk away. The beach is in the grounds past the poolRoomRoom was one of Jayakarta suites in which comes with a balcony with an outstanding sea view. All even numbered rooms I believe offer sea view but only suites have balcony. The suite is one large room with additional bathroom area.The large room has a very comfortable large king size four poster bed with white drape curtains either side and is very romantic. The bed has bedside tables with a phone and itself is very comfortable, not too firm, not too soft with nice soft bedding, I slept very well.Directly facing the bed is an door cabinet containing a small LCD tv with a mini fridge below . Tv viewing offers a good selection of international channels including: HBO, Russia today, Discovery, ESPN & regional Asian channels. The mini bar fridge contains a good selection of drinks but no snacks (& no snack items in hotel shop so best buy in town).There is a good size wardrobe adjacent to bed with laptop size easy to use safe, slippers, large umbrella & a robe plus few coat hangers. The room also offers a traditional local wooden carved seating area with some nice lamps plus a working desk & chair. There is also a kettle with some tea & coffee sachets.There is a single AC unit & worked well cooling room with no issue with a remote control. Lighting is good with various mellow lamps shades tall & small but somewhat limited plugs unless you unplug lamps. Decor is traditional Indonesian premium style.There are double doors that exit to a decent size balcony with superb view of pool and sea area, you can see Kalawi & other islands in the distance. The sunset is beautiful. However the metal chair is not that comfortable for extended sun set relaxation & better to take chairs from seating area. It is good spot if your a smoker that prefers to smoke outside.Along the corridor from entrance of room there is an original thick white drape used as a door that enters a generous size bathroom.This includes a large spacious shower cubicle and separate bath also with extendable shower. A large sink and also an area for females to do make up with nice seat facing a full mirror, hair dryer and vanity box. The marble finish is nice giving a fresh premium image to the room.Generous hotel branded amenities are offered that include bath foam, body lotion, shampoo, toothbrush, comb, sewing kit and in addition a lovely oil burner with jasmine oil (replaced daily) accompanied by various candles -great for chilling out after a hard day of Komodo dragon trekking. They also offer a natural soap in which they change every day from lemongrass to lavender. A generous amount of towels & two complimentary bottled waters are offered daily. Overall this room is five star for a Indonesian hotel beach resort, functional, relaxing, romantic with the romantic bed & balcony view being the highlight.FacilitiesThe hotel offers free WIFI but this is offered on lower floor rooms, I was on floor 5 (2nd level up & picked it up with no issues) but generally it is only available on floor level at pool and lobby. It sometimes works well & sometimes doesn't, it's more of an issue of the region as also had issues in town than the hotel.The hotels offers a very nice pool surrounded by Palm trees & roofed large Cabana beds surround the pool, but also enough loungers & seating in area. The pool was very clean and on one side is a giant chess set.Surrounding this is a well kept garden decorated with plants and clean walkways & a pathway that leads to the beach. The beach itself is short, bit dirty & nothing to get excited about, this is partly because a short boat ride to the Komodo national park offers some of the nicest & most natural white sand beaches in the world - perfect for snorkelling with lots of space & privacy.On one side of the pool is a bar area & a gift shop with some local items & convenient toilets. The lobby is all open & offers a buffet restaurant which had a fairly decent selection for this region of choices for both dinner & breakfast. Food is all fresh with good Indonesian flavours plus some western choices. Next to reception is some relaxing seating & a tour offices both of diving and boat tours- arranged a private speed boat one day to Komodo & wooden boat another to the flying fox island - both amazing experiences with very clear professional service offered with bookings. They use a Part time navy captain for the speed boat and so you feel very safe plus they offer nice lunch boxes & unlimited drinks. Overall whilst you do pay it is worth the money to do direct with hotel as the service is efficient & they look after you very well.StaffStaff really offer the true personal Indonesian hospitality of five star standard which is sometimes missed in some of the 5 star popular chain hotels in Bali. Service is personal, everyone from housekeeping, laundry dept, reception, tour desk & catering staff, smile & makes one feel special & welcomed every time you pass them or interact. Even the security guard has biggest smile ever & nice to talk to. It is true warmth & really left a positive lasting impression.As I result, the Jayakarta suite gets full 5 stars, I loved this hotel experience, very clean & very quiet and would not hesitate to book this hotel when I return to this beautiful destination. I just hope the large international chains don't invade this area because this hotel offers the most natural Indonesian hospitality & comfort."

Expensive drinks and food as other reviewers have said, compared to places in town. Building looks like something from soviet Russia. Perhaps most disappointing, for the price and image they try to display, is the poor level of English of staff and inability to help constructively with various things like local travel, going to Komodo (extortionate quote from them), and especially flexibility in changing your booking. Local guide picked up at airport had better English and was more helpful. If the place had been half the price maybe I wouldn't complain."

"Labuan Bajo","The Jayakarta Suites Komodo-Flores","4","wayne d","Melbourne, Australia","our trip to the flores","we booked a suite at this hotel,and were pretty shocked this is no way a 5 star hotel 3 star yes,the jayakarta suite is just a room like any room at a 3 or 4 star hotel not a suite,the television is tiny did not think you could buy television that small,the leather chair was ripped plaster coming off walls in bathroom,sunlight wakes you up at 5.30am, the wifi keeps cutting out the closet is just a small wooden closet with a safe box,the shuttle bus goes into the town twice a day 11.am and 6.00pm pick up 9pm,the pool is nice the air con is great in the room ,the buffet breakfaast is average and dangerous,there are these small birds around 15 or so that sit all over the tables take food from the trays standing on the plates that we have to pit our food on,what i really want to warn people that stay here is DO NOT USE THE HOTEL TRAVEL AGENT rip off,go into the town and negotiate with travel companies in the town will save you a fortune,he the travel agent wanted $860 american dollars for a 90 minutes speed boat drive to the komodo island or $540 american dollars for a slow 4 hour boat trip,we got it 640 at treavel agent in the town,also no one takes visa or master card any type of credit card the hotels are the only places that accept credit card,, resturaunts travel agents supemarkets ect in the town do not take credit so take enough cash with you,back to the hotel we looked at a couple other hotels and 1 in particular looked alot better than this one and its just down the road if you hire motor bike your fne to get around,but the hotel charges 100.000 thousand for a 6 minute drive into the town but it is alot cheaper and easy to get locals to drive you on the back of there motor bikes they will charge you $2.50-3.00 for each person also there are some cheap but awesome resturants in the town most have local food but some have mixed please check menues and priceses some of them are expensive but if you look around there are some very cheap with the best food,also this island is hotter than bali so at this hotel when you have your buffet breakfast you eat sweating as there is no air con or cieling fans in the hotel resturaunt staff are friendly but most do not speak english is not suitable for western tourist,the town people are freindly bette to use internet cafe in the town as hotel wifi is really bad and there is no hotel pc to use"

The breakfast is a very good buffet, with all kinds of food. The coffee is also very good and strong.The staff is friendly.The only thing : I thought the drinks and the restaurant and food were a bit too expensive. So we ate out in Labuan bajo all the time except for breakfast. There are free shuttles at 9:00 am and 6:00 pm, picks up at 13:00 and 9:00 pm.The rooms have AC that's very powerful which is nice. Our room could have used a little painting though... But still the room was very clean and the wifi from the pool worked in our room. The hotel seemed quite big but we felt like not many people were using the grounds during the day, which was nice for relaxing by the pool.I would recommend the hotel and would come back ( at the price we paid which was around 70$ US, not at the price they're asking of 200$ a night when u try to book directly with them)."

Just to set the expectation. Breakfast is good, we can choose different selection of foods (local and international). The room (suite) is huge and clean even a bit old style/design but still okay. Aromatherapy oil and its candle is provided. The swimming pool is good, nice area to relax. The view is okay but the sands is not white. The wifi is only available around the lobby and pool. Should be expanded to be available in every room, I would suggest. The free shuttle (scheduled) is available but should you need special time then must pay for about USD 4.5 per trip. This should be fair enough, I think considering the location which is not inside the city center."

We payed for a suite which was nice but for some reason I was still a little disappointed for the price we payed. I was bed hound for the first 3 days and so thank God for HBO and Fox Sports.Breakfast was good, staff were friendly and thankfully we found somewhere that served decent coffee. We ate at the hotel a few nights but found the menu to be very limited and just a bit over priced. A beer was £5 which is what if pay in London.We ate in town for the majority and used the hotels free shuttle service. My.only criticism with this service is the fact that the drop off/ collection times were too far apart.The hotel itself was great, but if you can't swim or play chess then you may struggle for activities during the day to keep you occupied. A little pool table/ ping pong outside would do this place wonders.Would I stay here again, prob not but it was just what the doctor ordered after my illness. Thank you"

As many here have said, and we agree, they might be a three star hotel. Like most places that one would rate as ""average"" you get a mixed bag with service, etc. But we decided ahead of time to spring for one of their nicer rooms. And it was nice! A lovely view of the sea from the balcony and a very comfortable bed. Our room came with a breakfast buffet. It was very nice, but watch out for the coffee. We like ours pretty strong, but were very surprised when cup number two brought hyper-talking and hot flashes (It was pretty funny!). We had an unsavory experience with our waiter the first night, so opted for room service instead. And after many confusing emails back and forth over the course of several weeks regarding using their ""fast boat"" to Komodo/Rinca, we ultimately opted to use a local, slow boat service recommended on Trip Advisor."

We were leaving immediately to catch a pre-booked tour to Rinca Island to see the Komodo Dragons (we saw 8...amazing!). The receptionist organised a take away breakfast for us which was great.In the evening we ate in the restaurant and enjoyed our meal. The prices were dearer than we had experienced in other Flores Hotels but this did not concern us too much. The swimming pool and gardens are very good.

Location is terrible.....far from town so every time you want to go to town it will cost you $5.00. Food and drinks are way overpriced and they have a captive audience since there is absolutely nothing else within walking distance. Food at their restaurant is mediocre at best and the service is poor. Room was just okay.....a thin curtain is the only thing separating the bedroom from the bathroom, so there is zero privacy. Room had a sewer smell to it. Air conditioning did not keep up with the hot temperatures. The power went off and on several times during the night. Staff has VERY limited English speaking skills......just inquiring about the most mundane things make them appear stumped. It got frustrating dealing with them. The only good thing I can say is that the grounds and pool were lovely and well kept. They need to put more emphasison the rooms instead of the exterior. Would not stay here again."

On the 29th of december together with some friends we took a boat to go swimming on the nearby Angel Island. Upon arrival on the beautiful white beach of this wonderful little island we were literally schocked when we saw the beach full of trash that came from visitors of this hotel!!! Dozens of lunch boxes with the name Jayakarta suites on them and dozens of plastic bottles thrown everywhere. Shame on the insensitive visitors but most of all shame for the staff of the Jayakarta Suites who are natives and they destroy such a wonderfull place. Everybody must boycott this unspeakable hotel which tries very hard as it seems to keep tourism away from this wonderfull place. I took photos of the trash and called them when we returned to Flores and when i started to complain to the person who answered the telephone he hung up on me!!!! Shame and Disgrace!!! Everybody spread this please so that noone sets foot again at this horrible hotel that destroys nature in such a vulgar way!!!!!"

I quite like the location of this hotel as it is quite, on the beach, far from any noisy area. Only negative point is the absence of wifi connection in the rooms. There is wifi in the public areas on the ground floor but it is slow. It should not take much for an hotel of this standing to upgrade their internet connection!"
"Labuan Bajo","The Jayakarta Suites Komodo-Flores","4","Mikhael G","","Komodo family trip","The hotel was pretty nice, and our family booked 2 rooms there with connecting door. The gm, staffs, and chefs was very friendly, and in our trip to komodo island, we were accomodated with enough foods, drinks, and snacks to keep us full and entertained all the time. The rooms and buildings were old, but pretty maintained for indonesian standard. We got nice touches in our rooms, such as fruits, welcome letter from the gm, and aromatherapy in our bathroom. Pool itself for me is one of the best spot in the hotel, where we can see beautiful sunset if lucky. Altough the building is pretty well maintained, it still cannot keep up with international 5 stars standard. It is still lacking certain top notch features, such as gym, bar, sauna, and spa. It is understandable that resources are often unreachable right there, but the quality and the variety of the foods still can be improved. The intriguing thing though is the transportation. It will be a much better stay if we were accomodated by newer, safer, and more comfortable cars. I think this hotel is very good, and it has been improving a lot. It just need a more meticulous attention to details, and one day im sure it can live up to its 5 stars expectation."

The Jayakarta Suites came out tops for many reasons: The friendly staff were very welcoming. My room had a great sea-view allowing me to watch the priceless sunset. Excellent and free shuttles to the town and airport. Magnificent swimming pool. The cleanest section of beach. Great breakfast.The hotel is situated 10 minutes out of town which is a welcome respite from being woken early by traffic and other noise. The hotel management went out of their way to make my stay pleasant and I was even offered a complimentary fishing trip on the resorts fishing boat. My room was comfortable and the Wi-fi worked well.

"Labuan Bajo","The Jayakarta Suites Komodo-Flores","4","ruscom","Melbourne, Australia","Acceptable beach resort","I stayed at Jayakarta because at the time of booking it was cheaper than the other resorts nearby, costing me 655k rp. per night. I have stayed there overnight previously, and have noticed a few issues since my last stay.The room itself was ok. The furniture showed its age with the top layer of wood beginning to peel off. The tv was too small for where it was in relation to the bed, and it strained my eyes. The walls appeared dirty, on closer inspection, these were attempts at cementing the cracks, which for some reason weren't sanded down. The lack of balcony in room, I consider an architectural flaw and a missed opportunity.On the plus side, the bed was comfortable, the shower was nice and large and the toiletries were good.With regard to the facilities, the pool looks very good, however has no shallow end, which annoyed my girlfriend who cannot swim. With regards the beach, I don't think the hotel is using it to its full potential. I think the path to the beach and the beach itself should be landscaped.I also did not enjoy the breakfast as much this time around. There isn't a whole lot of choice, the food was quite bland (with the exception of the omelette and some cakes), and the stuff I wanted kept getting eaten before I arrived.Cost wise, you're better off eating and getting everything done in town. The cheapest way to get there is using an ojak (motorbike lift) for 10k rp one way. You do have to go outside the hotel grounds to do this though. They do have a free shuttle leaving at 11 and 6 though, with a pick up 3 hours later but I found it to be unreliable."

The pool area is very nice, that was probably the best part. The rooms were not very clean, sheets were OK but the walls were dirty (typical in Indonesia). The restaurant was not frequently visited, so it was very slow and often had no stock. There was no 'activities counter' to help you with planning trips. For example, the people at the hotel had no idea how we could rent snorkels. They sent one of their friends to tell us about boat trips and hikes, the prices about 3x what they were if you wandered into town and asked around. In addition, DO NOT do your laundry at this hotel. Or at least, look at the prices. This is like a 3-star hotel, charging Ritz Carlton rates for laundry. Seriously ridiculous rates ($80 for 1 not full load). The hotel manager took some % off of our bill due to how upset we were (and yes, it was our fault for not looking), so that was to their credit."
"Labuan Bajo","The Jayakarta Suites Komodo-Flores","4","jasongwill","Jakarta, Indonesia","So much potential","We finished our 4 day trip through Flores at this hotel for 2 nights. Compared to our Spartan style accommodation at other towns in Flores, it was nice to finish our vacation at a proper hotel. It is a little bit out of town, but the hotel runs a shuttle service and you can get a motorcycle taxi (ojek) for 10,000 Rupiah one-way for the 10 min trip to & from the downtown area. This hotel is situated on the long stretch of beach facing west, which means it was perfect for seeing the beautiful Flores sunset. Heaven knows why they didn't build balconies on the normal rooms (only on the small number of suites) as it would balconies would have been fantastic vantage points to watch the sunset. What a waste. The hotel is beachside, however there no chairs have been put on the beach for the guests. Overall the service was a little lethargic and at one point I call the hotel from my mobile to get someone to provide drinks service by the pool. And at the buffet breakfast the next morning I had to search for someone to attend the egg station.There is a hotel restaurant that serves decent food and usually offers buffet packages - however there are some good restaurants close by and downtown that are also worth visiting. Overall a good experience though."

I also speak the language. First, the positives. Friendly staff, good pool area. The negatives: breakfast is very uneven in terms of offerings, the food in general is horribly overpriced and not very tasty. Perhaps the worst aspect is the transportation. Despite being a decent distance from town, they only offer two shuttles a day. If you want to pay, you might be able to arrange a ride into Labuan Bajo with them. The biggest issue is that, despite reserving transportation for our group to travel to the airport and reconfiriming the day before, we were made to wait 30 minutes and almost missed our plane. No apologies or explanations from the staff. Bu Wati at the front desk seemed completely overmatched. No manager was present at any time during our stay. The rooms are just OK and the lack of a door to the bathroom is not a stylistic choice, just a complete miss on their part. I recommend that you try one of e other properties in Labuan Bajo, despite whatever platitudes may make up the response of Baju to my honest review."

The beach in that area isn't nice but we went for the diving and the Komodo dragons so we didn't mind.Our issue was that its a pain to get into town to the dive shops. We booked a car with the hotel everyday and everyday it was almost an hour late. We kept booking it for earlier and earlier but it didn't help. The staff is nice enough but they really don't have the transportation to and from town sorted out and the hotel is too far to walk.

Our airport transfer which was free didn't arrive so we had to use a local taxi, only $5 Aus but as its remote it was a bad start. Hotel itself is nice, nasty pot holes on the hotel road so a bit bumpy, English is not the best from the staff, rooms were ok the sea view is very nice. Our shower had no pressure but air con ok. Our rate included buffet breakfast which was ok mixture of east and west, their all day menu a bit pricey. They charge $5 Aus for a return taxi it's pretty much the only way into the harbour unless you have a scooter. I recommending eating at Mediterrano lovely pizza and cold beer. Good pasta and fish as well and nice views over the bay and boats. Our return taxi once didn't arrive and the other time was 45 minutes late but their are many taxis passing along the main strip that cost $2 Aus to return to hotel as its about 4km out from the harbour. Over all an ok hotel but its cheap and has a great pool and view if you organise those rooms."

We wandered around, eventually waiting in sweltering heat of a dusty parking lot where all the shady taxi scam guys converged on us like vultures. Finally, after waiting a half hour, we got in a strange car with one of these drivers after agreeing on a price of 50,000 rupiah (about US $5) for the 10 minute drive to Jayakarta Suites. Shockingly, the hotel refused to reimburse me for this small amount. You can tell a lot about the level of service provided at a hotel by something like that.The rooms are tiny and in bad need of renovation. The cheapest quality ""boarding house"" type materials were used and they are clearly showing their wear. Door knobs were covered in slime and linens were stained. It's laughable that this place promotes itself as ""5 Star""!!!The location is quite far from town, so we had to eat dinner at the hotel restaurant, which was very average and extremely over-priced.All in all, I would say almost anywhere you stay in Labuan Bajo would be preferable to this dump."

The hotel is very nice. For Flores Island, it is probably a 5-star while not allowing comparison to 5-star hotels in a large metropolis. One of our group was Indonesian so we had no language issues. We had 2 connecting suites which were roomy and comfortable. The best part of staying there is its proximity to Komodo and Rinca Islands. The boat ride there was heavenly. The visit to Komodo and Rinca Islands was unforgettable. We were the only tourists there at the time which made it even more enjoyable. We saw a total of 13 Komodo dragons on both islands. We stopped on a heavenly white sand beach to have lunch between Komodo and Rinca Island. We took 2 of our grandchildren there and they had a blast. We bought carvings and pearls from vendors on the beach. They made wonderful gifts on return. The only drawback for us at the hotel was that they did not have portable cots for the children and no couches, so we had to accomodate as best we could. I recommend that they consider accomodating families with children."

Considering Flores is a small island with limited hotels, that might be the case by their standards .. I would rate it 4 for 4 ..The hotel is very nicely laid out, facing the sea with nice views from most of the rooms .. A spacious coffee shop with attentive and smiling staff consists of a nice evening menu and a decent spread for breakfast buffet and egg station .. The food itself is quite tasty from the items I tried ..Pool area is nicely lit with a few sunbeds and some shaded seating areas and a giant chess table ..The rooms are a bit old and plain but spacious and comfortable with a big bathroom and shower room ..They do have a spa at basement level, but recommend you book ahead to get the use of it .. The staff there are quite professional and know what they are doing .. I tried the foot massage that seats you in a big comfortable chair in the spa check in area but they do have treatment rooms for other spa treatments and packages .. It did look quite clean and well maintained ..It is a bit out of the way not walkable distance to much really but I presume its setup to be in a quite local to get some relaxing time to oneself ..The staff are very friendly all of them greeting any guest that happens to pass by in the coffee shop, passages or lifts .. And they are all smiling to make you feel at home ..I did see some newer hotels coming up closer to the small town on the way to the airport that I might try if I did go back, but wouldn't mind staying here again .."

Our guide Suri stayed with us for the entire trip and provided us with lunchboxes, which we ate on the boat anchored off a gorgeous sandy beach. The hotel itself was not busy at all. We had one of the suites, which was massive, the bathroom alone was the size of a normal hotel room. We got a beer in the restuarant, then drank it on our balcony as we watched the sunset. Truly amazing !!! Dinner in the restaurant was great, and included in the trip so we ate off the set menu. The staff all spoke good English and were really friendly.

While arriving our eyer brows raised already as the way and avenue to this hotel is already bad. The reception desk staff is very friendly and does speak English though not much is possible. What you see is what you get. Fir example there is a menu which shows 5 or 6 types of (local and imported) beers. Non of these are available, only the local non listed Anker beer was available while we were there. Every thing you do or not do can trigger an event for which you have to pay more. Losing your room key = INR 50,000. They threatened us to have this paid. As I have never experienced this before we did not pay in the end and the room key was left in the room. The breakfast is basic though good but served in the non airco restaurant. We also did experience the fact that the local police used this restaurant to have they regular bribe food served. Very weird. The 'city' is 20 min away while the shuttle service can be convenient but can also be very cumbersome at peak hours."

The breakfast is a buffet and its really sub average. If you like eggs you'll be fine but otherwise its not great. Dinner was tasty but really expensive for what it is - better off going into town. DO NOT use the Orca dive club. They will charge you almost double what you can get dive wise from all the operators in town. You shouldn't pay more than IDR2.2mln for 3 days of diving (6 dives). The beach isn't worth going on - dirty and small - which is a shame since its supposed to be a ""beach front hotel"". The pool is great and the staff wonderful."

Very clean pool, sun loungers and shaded sun beds and outstanding views of perfect sunsets - the best place to be after a day of diving in salt water!We only had breakfast at the hotel but there was plenty choice and the staff are very attentive at breakfast and in general.Unfortunately, the ""beach"" isn't the white sand and clear waters you would expect on an island paradise thanks to the river estuary, but this is only a minor set back, and rectified by the unbelievable diving out in the deeper waters!The hotel also offers a cheaper taxi service into Labuan Bajo so you can go to a restaurant for dinner, but there are also some nearby restaurants within walking distance.Orca Dive Club is based at the hotel and cannot recommend them enough.Would recommend to anybody and will definitely be back!"
"Labuan Bajo","The Jayakarta Suites Komodo-Flores","4","JohnP_SHA","Shanghai, China","Not 5 stars at all!!!","It is just not a 5 star hotel it is not even 4 I'd probably go with a weak 3 stars. I start off with a nice thing the the restaurant area has a nice view and the pool. It is actually nice with warm water the little pavilions are nice to spend a few relaxed hours at.The hotel as such building wise is a shame! It looks like 70s communist concrete architecture in brown beige which just ruins the landscape. The way from the street to the hotel is just horrible an unpaved road with tons of wholes in it, until you get to the hotel entrance with the car you might throw up. The staff building along the path right next to the hotel looks like a big concrete container again just a shame for the landscape. And the soccer field right next to the hotel is just like a landfill completely trashed with plastic! The rooms are quite sterile with a tile floor and marks and stripes on the walls. The worst part is, the bathroom has no door just a curtain... so if you are a couple and one has to go to the bathroom it might be a live event for the other one in the bed with all noises and smells... We actually had a suite funny and sad thing at once, the balcony with a great view just has one chair... SORRY IF YOU CALL YOURSELF A 5 STAR HOTEL THIS IS JUST RIDICULOUS!!!! The rooms are clean on the first impression but if you look behind any piece of furniture its just disgusting its never been cleaned and if you need electricity you have to look behind the furniture because thats where the outlets are. Sorry another ""not acceptable for a 5 star hotel"" not even for a four star!!!The restaurant.... Breakfast, the guy on the egg station does a good job, fried eggs, the omelets are decent. But besides the cereals which you cannot do much wrong about it, you can't eat anything else... There are some toast sandwiches, with whatever on it, but it is dried out until you get to eat it. They have one plate of fruit but if its empty its empty they wont bring anymore. There is some pastries if you are lucky they are fresh on one day of the week but if not... There is some fried rice, fried chicken... but mostly just dry, as well as some more indonesian warm dishes i can't judge because i can't eat those things for breakfast. The coffee is ok, they do have coffee latte, cappuccino, espresso... on the drinks menu and there is a decent italian gastro espresso machine standing around but if you ask for it they can't make it... either the machine does not work or they cant or they dont want to operate it. The rest of the restaurant food is eatable... not really good, very varying on the portion sizes and VERY EXPENSIVE... For a beer, sprite and juice you can easily spend EUR 10, ~USD 13 for a light snack, two salads with two water easily EUR 20, ~ USD 26. The hotel charges 20% tax and service while all restaurants charge 10%!!!!!The service, the staff is rather friendly but useless... they just can't speak english. Very few words... We had the case that we wanted to go to the silvester buffet I was asking for the price and five people were standing in front of us unable to tell us how much the buffet was...The front desk was unable to connect an international call, I missed a business telephone conference because of that, because that day cell phones were not working.There is wifi available almost throughout the hotel, though you have to be really lucky to be able to connect and then actually get a internet connection.There is no concierge as they would have to have as a 5 star hotel, the hotel car to town is about 5 times as much as a regular car from town to the hotel. The spa is a sad and dark room in the basement just as the gym, you can't use it because you would get depressions. We were actually the second time at the Jayakarta Suites Komodo this time, but simply because of diving and personal connections with the dive center. While price wise sure not on the 5 star site, if they claim to be one I have to rate them according to 5 star standards. And it is just lightyears away from that, not even 4 stars. There are a couple of things which are just not acceptable and considering this, it is actually quite expensive. We did actually see the monkey on the chain again..."

I would boycott this place as loudly as I could... but I have now been told that they have built a nice free range enclosure for the monkeys.Please consider supporting them by staying there - and tell them that the reason why is because they changed their attitude about defenseless animals and are now caring for the monkeys properly?"

They actually asked for 50,000 for transport to the village which I thought was a bit weird, but whatever. They were very helpful, but found it hard to communicate with the staff as they had a hard time with English. Don't get me wrong, I fully understand I'm in Indonesia and I'm the one that doesn't speak their language, but figured I'd share my experience. After many convos of trying to get info, I became a bit frustrated but delt. If you want to do Komodo/Rinca, go into town and give a local your business. Extremely cheaper and had a great experience. As for my room (620), it was awesome. It was a top corner suite with an incredible view. You should request this room for sure! Wifi actually worked in there too as i caught it from the pool signal. They tell you up front that no wifi in room....only in lobby. Score! :) Comfy bed too. Very spacious and 4/5 on the clean scale. Food is way more expensive in the hotel, but is very good. The Thai beef salad was great. I def reccomend staying here, but only if your looking for luxury in town. You can def go cheaper somewhere else and prob be fine. In some ways, I wish I stayed in town for the convenience, but was happy to relax in my room when I got there."

The swimming pool and ambience was great although the rooms can be improved. We stayed at the 7th floor of the hotel with the sea view room. The bed is comfortable but there's no door for the bathroom so it's a bit awkward when you're staying with friends, other than that it's clean, decent and new. Hotel staff were very kind and helpful to us and the airport pick up and drop off were like a breeze. I highly recommend it to anyone to stay there when they visit Labaun Bajo.We were on a 4day tour for Komodo Island and Rinca Island, so when we came back to stay at the hotel it was a bliss!

Just one lift serving 7 floors, used by the staff and (if place) guests.2. We have been living in Jakarta for the last three years and traveled extensively in Indonesia and 5 star hotels don't have such small standard rooms without balcony anywhere.Jayakarta suites are almost 5 star standard rooms just the famous lack of door to the bathroom.The word Suite comes from the French word ensuite mostly used to describe a bedroom and living room separated. Yes there is an inflation in the word ""suite"" but...... 3. No restaurant, just a sort overpriced cafeteria without any management.

The hotel is a little out of the centre of Labuan Bajo, but this wasn't a big deal as it was easy to get to the centre when we wanted to go out for dinner. The hotel itself is clean and pleasant, and the breakfast, which was included in our room rate, was good with plenty of choice - but what makes me grade it with four stars is the outstanding attitude of the staff. Everyone we spoke to was incredibly friendly and helpful, really going out of their way to make our trip pleasant - from arranging our day trip, to the always-smiling faces that greeted us at breakfast and the drivers who took us to and from the town for dinner (we were picked up right on time on the two nights we were there).

We didnt know this was such a new place though. Got off the plane, hired a driver and went looking for rooms. Jayakarta was one of the last places we check out, not really interested in the big square hotel thing. Sure glad we choose this place, it was awesome for us. all the staff were great, they really are very welcoming and go out of thier way to make you feel welcome. Right from the cleaning staff, grounds keepers, front desk, restaurant and the fun guys in Nick's pub ... the staff were the best we have had so far in our last three weeks in Indonesia.

"Labuan Bajo","The Jayakarta Suites Komodo-Flores","4","Kai S","New York City, New York","Made you feel welcome","It is a new hotel and the staff is learning the trade. While there are some things which need to be improved, the most crucial factor is in place: the right attitude. The guest was treated very friendly and with a genuine service attitude from the reception (at the airport) to the check-out. The hotel itself was very clean and the facilities were nice; pool, breakfast area and spa. Now the improvements: yes, the hotel could use another lift; the gym ventilation could also be more effective; and it was a bit odd to see some of the staff having breakfast at the same time with the guests. The main shortcoming, however, was the car dispatch. As the hotel is some 2-3 km from the town, the guests rely on hotel transport to reach restaurant, diving school, harbour,... The booking of the car for the trip TO the town was easy. However, coordinating the pick-up was somewhat challenging. Telephone connection was bad, the drivers missed the passengers at meeting point (just passing by!), time pronouncements were vague, etc. This has to be corrected in order to maintain the guest base. Otherwise, it was a lovely experience in the poorest province of Indonesia. There is a great potential for tourism in Labuanbajo. Dont spoil it!"

Little out of town but that nit the problem at all.Check-in process was great and they updated our booking to the higher type which is very kind of them ( we just assumed the place is dead empty) The surround look dry and not well groomed but again the excuse was this if Flores (we invented the nice name for this TIF) The room was spacious but the TV is tiny bit and not easy to look at since was too small from our bed (the only place we can watch TV) We have lunch at the restaurant and the service was so slow, it took 1 hour to get our drink after we ask a guy with black polo (uniform?) and our kids quite impatience. Our order food was nothing special and I have to say is the worst meal ever we have been tasted during our trips in Flores. Total pricey but not worth it. Overall it was just OK< the beach is nothing and not for swimming. The front office staff are great but not their F&B team. Breakfast look sad and no taste at all.\"

However, the food was overpriced and vastly disproportionate in comparison to the amount we paid for the room. We also did not like the monkeys chained up in the garden.

The service was the same. It's a clear 3-star hotel type with 3-star service and 3-star experience.The room was nice, though. I have no problem with the room. It was in good size and good layout, although I still think it's a 4-star room. Breakfast was alright, nothing special. The best feature of this hotel, I have to say, is the swimming pool! After a hot day's trip to the islands and in the sea, a plunge into a fresh water swimming pool felt really great.They should change the published rate. It's just ridiculous if they continue having published rates twice the actual achieved rates. Hotels exist to service travelers and guests, not to fool them with 'false' prices."

Tip: Do not even bother with a standard room. The standard rooms are dank, small windows, and you feel like you're in a convent. The suite room is much nicer and you will actually feel like you're on a vacation. Pros:* Pool is beautiful * Grounds are well kept. * Suite room is beautiful, clean* Restaurant food is decent, although slightly overpriced* Staff is very friendly, some language issues - had some issues of checking in/out due to a mix-up that was not the hotel's fault, but worked with the Assistant Manager who was really kind and patient. Because of my extended stay, she upgraded me to a suite with no charge.* Only 10 minutes from airportCons: * Like earlier reviewers stated, the hotel has an eerie, abandoned feel to it. I rarely saw other guests. I think because of the lack of ambiance and activity in the hotel, the emptiness feels creepy as opposed to peaceful. * Beach area is quite rocky and not somewhere you want to hang out - you can find nicer beaches in Flores to vacation near * Hotel is far from everything. There is a free shuttle to the dock, but you need to pay if you want to go into town to experience local Flores culture. Considering the location, there should be a free shuttle to town. Overall:The staff truly puts in the effort to make the stay nice and they obviously work hard. However, the odd location of the hotel and overall lack of atmosphere makes me think that for the money, you can find a better vacation spot. This is not a bad place to stay as a stop-over for a night or two, but if you want to stay in Flores as your vacation spot, I would recommend looking elsewhere."

"Labuan Bajo","The Jayakarta Suites Komodo-Flores","4","Rickbarrett","Perth, Australia","3-stars for trying","Billed as a 5-star hotel, the Jayakarta is one of three or four multi-story hotels on the beaches to the south of Labuan Bajo. The town itself is not worth a second look, with only three or four reasonable restaurants for travellers. The 5-star hotels to the south are a portent of what is to come – luxury accommodation for visitors wishing to go to Komodo National Park. In Labuan Bajo itself, there is nothing worth staying at, and little to recommend it. As to the Jayakarta: anywhere else it would be a 3-star hotel. It's not that the staff don't try to provide excellent service – they do. But the building itself leaves much to be desired. Don't be fooled: there is no white sand beach. The beach is brown with driftwood trees snagged offshore – so it's really shallow!As to the facilities, they just don't get it!Every room has hard floors and heavy furniture. The sound of people dragging furniture around goes on all night. The lift (at least there is one) beeps as it passes every floor. So beeping happens all night. The restaurant has reasonable food, but after a couple of days, you run out of options. I desperately wished for a nasi goreng without an egg!Sure, Flores is remote – but is that a reasonable excuse? This is a big Indonesian hotel chain – surely they can do better.That said, I will give the staff 5-stars! They did everything to make us comfortable. My wife broke her wrist in Komodo National Park and, rather than seek medical attention, needed to ice-up the wrist, bandage it and keep it steady in a sling. The staff were appropriately concerned and supportive.Interestingly, we both commented on the staff uniforms – tight short-shorts seemed OK to me, but she was scathing!As to the provision of tourist information – forget it. Plan what you need to do before you arrive! Everyone want to go to Komodo National Park on Rinca or Komodo - how hard is it to provide some information! We had the taxi driver hanging around waiting or us to make a decision as soon as we arrived.If you want my advice on what to do – see my review of attractions at Labuan Bajo!"

Honestly, the pool area and proximity to the ocean are the only components that save this resort from a 'poor' rating. The pool area really is beautiful and relaxing. Just don't go expecting the Ritz. For example, there was no bathroom door- we had a curtain separating the bedroom from the bath. Not a big deal for us, but it may be for some.Arrange for the hotel to pick you up from the airport. Without arranged transport, arriving into Flores is a bit crazy... plenty of characters willing to give you a ride while aggressively selling you on boat tours to Komodo. The hotel is located quite a ways from town (too far to walk), but it's worth it to take a taxi... the food at the hotel is waaaay overpriced and mediocre at best. English is a struggle with most of the staff; we had some confusion trying to arrange for transportation to get us down to the harbor. Like another TA reviewer noted, the whole resort seemed to be empty... instead of being a positive (getting to have the area to yourself), it felt eery and abandoned. Not sure why. One final note: be wary of the concierge's 'recommendations' on boat trips to Komodo. We spoke with one concierge member who told us she would get us info on possible boat rentals and came back with one 'option.' She tried to pressure us into booking by having the boat captain meet with us, and the price quoted was about 4x what other boats down at the harbor were charging. It seemed clear that she was getting some sort of kickback from the boat captain she brought by. This may have been an isolated incident, but be sure to do your research on the going rate before committing."

He told us his name was Jack and he was mentioned in the Lonely Planet. He said he could do us a deal for £40 for the 2 of us. He took us to look at his boat on the way to the hotel. On arrival at the hotel, the price suddenly jumped up to £400. Tried to decline his offer but there was a bit of a kerfuffle because we had originally said yes to his £40 and he had transfered us from the airport (which the hotel do for free) and wasted his time.Went down to the harbour ourselves and organised a 2 day trip to Komodo and Rinca with one of the captains. Cost us £70 each for the 2 of us with food and sleeping onboard. (The more of you there are the cheaper it becomes)Bumped into Jack ""from the lonely planet"" at the harbour and he was trying to get commission off the captain because we were supposedly his clients.

Overall, don't expect a 5 star experience but you will have a good time."
"Labuan Bajo","The Jayakarta Suites Komodo-Flores","4","Mike K","Bali, Indonesia","The strangest pricing system in the world","It's impossible to recommend this hotel. It's so far away from 5 star it's untrue. The rooms are clean and reasonably priced and the pool is nice, but the management of the hotel, despite the best efforts of the friendly staff, is bizarre. The worst aspect is the food and drinks pricing. We had 13 people including kids and we would have been quite happy to spend a day around the pool having drinks and food and a play in the pool. The problem is that the food and drink prices are crazy, more expensive than at Bali's best restaurants. A large bintang by the pool is over 100,000 rupiah after tax and service charges! And even more if delivered to the room (although strangely a can from the fridge is only 24,000). A steak is over 200,000.  This means for a large group that it's far cheaper, although a hassle, to go to a better restaurant such as Made in Italy in town to eat.The landscaping is also rather stark, none of the bars or restaurants have any atmosphere (although the whole place was empty when we stayed), there is no beach, the football pitch was flooded when we were there despite no rain for five days, and the tennis court looks and plays like it's 20 years old even though it has to be quite new.During a massage the very apologetic masseuse was interrupted by one manager three times. Finally she was called out to speak to him. He then came in to speak to me - he simply wanted to know my name. Not very relaxing at all and rather typical of the whole place."

The hotel has a nice pool area. Rooms are clean. Big modern bathrooms. Everything works, even wifi. We were the only guests and i guess that added to the empty feel of the place.

"Labuan Bajo","The Jayakarta Suites Komodo-Flores","4","LozzaJLondon","London","Lovely staff, great rooms, strange location","We stayed here for a couple of nights after being bitten to death by mozzies in another hotel in town. The hotel is very modern, clean, with rooms of a high standard (and very nice bathrooms!). The pool is great too, with lovely views over the sea. My favourite thing about the hotel was the staff, who were really very nice to us (generally Indonesian people are extremely lovely). They baked and decorated a cake for my boyfriend's birthday, and all the staff came out to sing :-) And the lady who collected us from town was really nice too. Generally the hotel is of a high western standard.However there are some odd things about the hotel too. The biggest downside is the distance from town, where anyone coming to Flores should make sure they spend at least one night staying. There aren't really taxis to get there, and the hotel charges you to drop off/pick up. Really they should offer this service for free given the location of the hotel. Secondly we didn't think the food was that great - our evening meals were included in our deal, but weren't really worth it. Plenty of nicer cheaper places to eat in town. Finally, the hotel was oddly empty when we stayed, which meant for a slightly odd atmosphere. But overall in nice hotel to offer a high level of comfort, and a nice break from slumming it in town!"

The pool area and setting are stunning, the open air reception and dining areas are lovely and the rooms (though small) are comfortable and tastefully decorates. Everything pointed to what would be an amazing stay but it was just that little bit hit and miss. We had a completely illogical argument with room service over the fact that if ordering exactly the same drinks via housekeeping they were significantly cheaper. No amount of explanantion could seem to make anyone see that this made no sense- we were forced to pay the infalted price! Also, a staff member used their swipe card to burst into our room without knocking while we were still in bed. Checkout took an inordinately long amount of time, frustrating because we were on a schedule to meet our boat. I can't say that the service was bad, but it was just strange. Overall, these little service hiccups made us chuckle, but still not what you would expect from a luxury hotel."

"Labuan Bajo","The Jayakarta Suites Komodo-Flores","4","Planetary","Austin, Texas","A Clean Gateway to Great Destinations","Your perception of this resort will depend on your expectations. If you are a diver or trekker looking for a clean, modern place to stay between adventures, you will find that it meets your needs nicely. On the other hand, if you are a couple or family looking for a full-featured beach destination, you may be disappointed. You will see four- and even five-star ratings for this hotel on some of the travel websites, but in our experience, these ratings are not justified. Here are the pluses and minuses we observed:+ The hotel is clean and modern, perhaps two years old. The room was comfortable, especially the bed. The air conditioner worked well. + Service was gracious and efficient, especially in the restaurant. + There is a dive shop accessible through the hotel lobby. It’s probably more expensive than many of the dive shops in town, but provided excellent service. We had five memorable dives with our guide, Johanes, whom we would recommend strongly. He also arranged a tour to Pulau Rinca, where we saw several komodo dragons and a water buffalo. + The restaurant was good, particularly the buffet breakfast. + The pool is clean and pretty. It’s just large enough (roughly 20 meters) to swim laps if you want. + The hotel provides free airport pickup and dropoff and will run you into town for Rp50,000 roundtrip. - The rooms are plain, and some features disappointing. For example, the bathroom has no door – only a curtain. This was particularly bothersome in the small deluxe room we initially checked into, which also lacked a balcony. The upstairs hallways are stark, like a college dormitory. We asked for an upgrade and moved to a suite at a very reasonable price.- If you like the occasional glass of wine or spirits, you would do well to bring your own, or go to the several decent restaurants in town (we liked the Mediterraneo and also the Lounge). Wine was grossly overpriced, Rp1,300,000 and up for very ordinary Australian whites and reds. Drinks at the bar were likewise way too expensive. Prices at local restaurants were reasonable, so the high prices at the hotel are not a consequence of the remoteness of the island. - The wi-fi was weak and slow. We could get adequate reception only within a few meters of the business center, and then not sufficient to use Skype for a phone call. - The beach is not suitable for swimming or wading. Perhaps due to a river that empties into the sea nearby, the water is shallow for at least 100 meters from shore, exposing vegetation and soil at low tide. The beach is barricaded with mounds of driftwood beyond the hotel property line, so you can forget about a romantic stroll too. - The fitness center is a small, locked room in the basement. The staff opened the room and turned on the ventilation when we wanted to use it, but the room was hot and musty. There was no TV. The equipment was adequate for the two of us, but even four people would have had an awkward time sharing it. - We didn’t see the monkeys chained in trees mentioned in other reviews, so hopefully the management has thought better of this. But we did see a deer on the neighboring lot tied to a stake, which seemed strange and pointless."

It located far from the Labuan Bajo village. We paid 70 US $ per night with the breakfast included. Near by the entrance, five baby monkeys were chained to the branches of a tree. They never have had water. They were left to themselves without food despite the searing heat.These monkeys live in very bad conditions. The hotel told us that they do not plan to build a cage."

A small infant was clearly malnourished and depressed and refused to eat the food that all other monkeys snatched up ravenously. As reported by other guests they seemed to have no water or food, we gave them some fruit but the charity of the occasional guest is not a solution..When complaining at the desk, the staff told us they had received many complaints already but reading previous reviews I am guessing they have done absolutely nothing to change the situation. I can confirm that no cage has been built. The staff told us the owner has many other hotels so he is hardly ever there and is anyway officially based in Jakarta.If anyone finds out the name/email address of the owner please post it on here, so at least we can write to this person"

The food was excellent. The room was incredible, but it turns out we got free upgrade to suite because my wife's sister works for a powerful banker in Jakarta and made sure we were take care of.

The location out of town makes arranging things in town quite difficult.If you want to stay in a quiet location this is nice.I had lots of troubles with the management .The hotel never replied to my emails about the dive shop which I could not find on he web.There is one indeed.We came in for one night at first and asked for the possibility to stay another one for the same price.The answer was yes in the evening but the following day they said that now the price has changed even if the same original price was still posted on their web pages.After a lobg discussion they agreed to the same rate.Next problem was the ""accidental "" overcharging of the credit card. The rates are quoted in US dollars and they convert it to IDRs when charging the card. Just by change I started to compute and noticed that there was a thirty per cent overchange.Again a gentle smile and ""I am so sorry"". Nest problem was with the recept for the second night which I paiud in cash. I had to ask for the receipt for four different times before they after 5 hours gave me a hand written receipt. Again everything with a gentle smile. I do not think that a hotel claiming to be a 5 star one should have this kind of management. I had a very similar experience in the expensive Turi hotel in Batam,Indonesia where they tried to charge a double price . So be careful there!"
"Labuan Bajo","The Jayakarta Suites Komodo-Flores","4","McBean26","London, United Kingdom","Very nice hotel, but not impressed by the animal cruelty..","My partner and I stayed at the Jayakarta in Labuanbajo for 5 nights in total. It must be a pretty 'low season' because during our stay we hardly saw another guest! The staff are friendly and helpful, although they were unable to facilitate arranging motorbike rental for us so we sorted this ourselves elsewhere. The pool was very nice, the hotel was clean and our room was comfortable with a great view of the sea. There were however quite a few tiny ants in the bathroom, although perhaps this can't be helped. An interesting feature of the bathroom was that it has a material curtain separating it from the bedroom rather than a door. Although it looked good, it does not provide much privacy which may bother some people. The food in the restaurant seemed overpriced and the one meal we did eat within the hotel was not particularly tasty. Furthermore, as a vegetarian, the only thing on the whole menu not containing fish or meat was 'spaghetti pomodoro' - not very exciting at the best of times.Moving on to the negative aspect of my review, my partner and I were at first thrilled to spot 'wild' monkeys in a tree when we parked our motorbike in darkness. However, we were sickened to discover in daylight that the same three monkeys were in fact chained to the branches of the tree. In all the days we were there, only once did we see a bucket of water, which was reachable by just one of the monkeys. The majority of the time they were left without access to food or water in the searing heat. We took to watering them and often found them to be very thirsty. Upon complaining to the hotel reception, we were told that these monkeys are owned by the hotel manager because he ""likes"" monkeys. Despite two attempts, we did not get to speak to the manager but registered our disgust that these monkeys should be kept chained up in what can only be considered to be very cruel conditions. Given that most people who visit Flores do so in appreciation of the flora and fauna, it seems highly inappropriate that a 4 star hotel should keep wild animals chained up on their resort. I am in the process of submitting a written complaint to the Jayakarta chain, so it remains to be seen whether action will be taken; ie the appropriate release of these monkeys into the wild. Whilst the hotel itself provided a pleasurable experience, i'm sure others will be put off by the mistreatment of these monkeys. If you read this review and do decide to book the hotel, please join me in complaining if the monkeys are still there (and give them each some water and a banana)."

"Labuan Bajo","Hotel Waecicu Eden Beach","0","ktabella","Berlin, Germany","DON'T STAY THERE!!!!!","Where to start. Well, this hotel felt like it had been abandoned and then some friends in their 20's decided to put it on the web and make money out of an abandoned place. There are no roads that goes directly to the hotel. A taxi left me at the top of a cliff and I had to trek my way down. When I got there another taxi was leaving a couple with a 2-year old toddler there as well, getting their stuff down (baby in one hand, stroller in the other, plus luggages and all) was an interesting experience. No one was there to welcome us, we waited a good 20 minutes before someone showed up. More trekking down with the staff, and we were shown our respective huts. The view is stunning but that's about it. We went all the (steep) way down to the restaurant to be told that there hasn't been any guests at the hotel for the last few weeks so they had nothing to eat but would go to the village later to get supply. Surprise no.1 : to go to the village by boat, you must pay 120,000 rp each way (I can't even imagine myself trekking all the way back up to the top of the cliff and wait for a taxi to take me to town, which would take 30 minutes probably considering the state of the road). The boat is basic and will dock not at the main commercial dock in town, not at the main secondary dock, but at the 2nd old wharf, only used by locals and you will have to jump from the boat unto the wharf. And jump again unto the boat from the wharf, which access might have shifted according to tide, to get back into the boat. You'll also have to get knee-deep into water (so choose your shoes accordingly) to access the boat and exit the boat at the hotel. Last possible schedule to comeback to hotel : 6pm so don't think about dinner in down, that will not happen, you're stuck at the hotel. Surprise no.2 : ABSOLUTELY NO WIFI except if you are with an indonesian provider, then they can sell you a data package (for an expensive price). Surprise no.3: the room was dirty. Shower door didn't close properly, old soap from previous guest still there, obviously hasn't been washed or cleaned in weeks, most probably months. My main door to my hut didn't close/open properly so everytime I had to fight with it. No water (I mean zero water) in the shower on the first day, and very low pressure on day 2. No hot shower at all. My mosquito net was super dirty, I meam major stains of stuff all over it. Floor was dirty as well. No daily room cleaning and no garbage bin. Surprise no.4 : no food in the hotel restaurant. No food or drinks (at all, not even water) when we arrived because there hasn't been guests in weeks but even once they went to the town to purchase stuff, food was rare. I tried to order chicken but they had none. Tried some salad, not possible, ended up having the basic salad (lettuce, watermelon and pineapple), which was wayyyy over price, and a fruit cocktail (only one available : watermelon, and they ran out of it by the next day...). Surprise 5 : no electricity for a good part of day 2, no plan to help us with all the stairs once it gets darks, we were pretty much on our own. Oh and no electricity meant no restorant, not even drinks. So on day 2, I only had breakfast. It sucked. Surprise no.6: there is a staff party in the restaurant kitchen and we're not invited. The owner was nowhere to be found (can't blame him for abandoning the place...), staff (like 10 of them?!?) Hung out in the kitchen all day, laughing loudly and not caring one minute about guests, I truly got the feeling I was bothering them. If me and the couple with the toddler wanted anything, we had to walk in the kitchen and ask for their attention. They seriously did not care about us. We bothered their party. Don't know where the staff was at night, but I so very glad another couple was there with me, especially in the hut next to mine. I absolutely would not have felt safe staying there by myself. Staff was, at best, about the equivalent of 7 floors below my hut, should something have happened at night (no surveillance), no one would have known or helped me. As a solo traveller, I would not have stay there if the other couple wouldn't have been there, I did not felt safe at all and the staff was one more worry to manage in case of an emergency. Seriously, don't go there.oh and the beach is dirty with garbage stuff and old plastic bottles floating in the sea, can't really swim there."

The surroundings and gardens are amazing and the whole property is beautifully nestled into the hillside above Waicicu beach. The property has quite a lot of environmental initiatives including solar hot water.Each Cottage has a very private view and balcony, and they are each perched on stilts on a very steep hillside. Room was quite comfortable with comfortable bed and mosquito net. The bathroom had a tiny shower cubicle which was not very clean, and had a door that leaked which in turn was damaging the wooden floor. Drainage was very poor from the hand basin too, so a bit of maintenance needed.There was only one power outlet in the bedroom but thankfully we always carry a power board.We were disappointed that our room was not serviced during our stay, and we had no broom or dustpan to sweep the floor of the inevitable sand when staying near a beach. Also our airconditioner had no remote, but thankfully we were able to switch it on from the unit itself.One thing that anyone staying here needs to be aware of is that the units are up a lot of steep steps (We counted 130 steps to ours). We treated this as a positive to maintaining our fitness but still made sure we did not have to just nip back to our room for anything!The owner was away when we stayed, and we felt the staff were taking advantage of this and were not very attentive at all in the Restaurant/Bar area, which is very pleasant and nicely decorated. We actually had to knock on the kitchen door a few times to get them to come and take our orders etc, and they were all very young and having a noisy fun time in the kitchen out of sight. There was not the attentive presence we have come to expect in Indonesia. The provisioning for the restaurant and bar was a little limited and there was items on the menu not available because of this, and one day they ran out of Bintang! (too many Aussies staying perhaps?)Overall the meals served were satisfactory, but not outstanding.We had the chance to walk around the area, swim and snorkel, borrow a canoe from the hotel and go further afield to nearby small islands, and really had a great time. We enjoyed watching the comings and goings of local boat traffic.The beach rubbish situation was pretty bad, and we picked up a lot while we were there. We encourage everyone to take the approach that tourists want the situation improved and will be proactive if necessary, and this embarrasses the locals into action.Overall we would definitely recommend a stay here. It really grew on us over the time we stayed. There were plenty of birds to watch. Development of the Labuan Bajo area is flying along, and will soon not be a sleepy town. visit while it is still simple and 'local'"

The boat ride was fantastic, an authentic craft. The view was lovely. The negatives: The mosquitoes are completely out of control. The food is expensive for Indonesian hotels. The quality is ok but not above average for Indonesia. The room had electricity but thats it, a authentic bamboo hut which Is actually its appeal which will suit the adventurous but the walk up and down the stairs at night is dangerous due to the lack of lighting and low hanging branches. Initially the guy that took me to the hut had never seen inside the room before as he was ""training"" he said. Room had a fan and mosquito net but were really alot of mosquitoes.We made the mistake of bringing a young child here but that was our fault. For the money I would recommend Sylvia Hotel next door where we moved to. For another $15 you get a real hotel room and can walk without fear of broken limbs or death."

Yes, the location is nice, this could have been a small paradise away from it all. But it doesn't feel like that, due to an owner and his staff who primarily treat his customers as sources of income, not as customers who have come for a nice experience and professional service. Room rate, extra bed, meals, water, transportation by boat, all have high prices, higher than the hotel's standard would justify. Welcome drinks were served on arrival, disappointing to see them back on our bill at check-out. And the pick up service by boat, announced on the website, was only available at a time convenient to the hotel, not at a time comvenient to us.Swimming is not good here, especially for children, because the sand off the beach is overgrown with algae. We felt trapped, as the place is isolated we did not really have a choice but to accept things once we arrived- but we did decide to cancel the second part of our stay and just leave.

The boat is the cheapest and easiest solution, but the last boat is at 5.30 pm. so after diving or going to Kompdo I never managed to catch the boat back, and therefore I had to get a motorcycle in the darkness.

Rooms have wonderful views but are a bit aged already. The place needs a renovation and cleanup. The beach is nice until the waterline, then it's muddy until the corrals start. Not opt for swimming in the sea and there is no pool. Restaurant is fine but order western food from the menu as the indonesian food we tried was tasteless.We didn't stay at the place but came twice to test it."

"Labuan Bajo","Hotel Waecicu Eden Beach","0","margaret_Aus446","Canberra, Australia","Natural beauty - unspoiled","My daughter and I have just spent 5 days at this hotel and rate it highly for splendid location, ethical environmental principles and good natured, caring staff. Set into a lush hillside the rooms blend so well into their environment you can hardly see them from the water. The higher rooms involve a bit of a climb, but the steps are well made and the views from your balcony make the effort worthwhile. The rooms have all your basic needs and the place is very clean. Some things like hot water pressure were weak, and don't expect hair dryers and TV's etc. But that's not what you're there for.The beds were comfortable, with mosquito net, we had air con and a fridge.Getting there, we had airport transfers from the airport at Labuan Bajo to the port, where a boat from Weacicu was waiting to take us to the hotel - a scenic boat ride of about 20 minutes. The beach in front of the hotel is not accessible for swimming and snorkeling at low tide, but at high tide the snorkeling is wonderful. Hammocks and day beds under the trees line the shore at intervals, local people live nearby and we particularly loved the unspoiled nature of the atmosphere there. We went on a tour of surrounding islands, swam with manta rays, saw Komodo Dragons, watched amazing sunset migration of bats from their island to the Flores mainland. Also we hired our own boat for the day, with 4 crew, and we went wherever we wanted. My daughter speaks Indonesian, so I cannot comment on the language skills of the locals. However I can say we found the local people delightful, innately good natured and friendly, and they form part of the attraction of the area.In conclusion, we liked this place more than some more expensive options we visited. This part of the world is very beautiful and it's wise to check it out before it becomes too touristy."
"Labuan Bajo","Hotel Waecicu Eden Beach","0","Marcus L","Horsham, United Kingdom","Not for everyone, but I liked it.","I arranged for the hotel to collect me from Labuan Bajo airport, and so had no idea what to expect. I was quite surprised to learn that after a short taxi ride to a jetty, we were then going by boat to the hotel. After around 15 minutes we arrived at the location of the hotel, but because the tide was out we had to then transfer to a small boat with an outboard motor, after a few years we then had to wade the rest of the way, which was quite a novel way of arriving at a hotel, for me anyway.The hotel is a series of wooden sheds set into a hillside, connected by a series of steep stone and wooden steps. I paid extra to stay in a room with a double bed and air conditioning. It was quite a walk up to it, but the views from the small balcony were fabulous. The air con was also very powerful, I was actually cold in the night. The bathroom was very basic, with no hot water, and even the cold water being no more than a trickle. The bed was comfortable but the sheets though clean were stained. The mosquito net was also very dirty. So the hotel is remote and basic, however once you get used to it, it's actually really nice. The staff are excellent, really friendly and helpful. The food, as befits a French owner is very good. The beer very cold and cheap, and even the coffee was very good. I didn't get to spend much time in the hotel, but could have happily spent a few more days there relaxing and getting back to nature. There is meant to be wifi at 7pm in the lobby/restaurant are, but after thirty minutes of trying I gave up. That's not actually a bad thing, as maybe it's good to completely get away from things once in a while. The hotel is definitely not for everyone, and certainly no use if you are not very mobile, however if you don't mind a few rough edges and want to get away from things for a while, this is definitely recommended."

Not far away only 15 minutes by boat (so easy from Labuan Bajo). I started in the standard room, takes a lot of stairs to go up. But a very nice and clean room. Later I stayed in a different room a little lower. Perfect! (Thank you Phil) Great view and also clean. The bathrooms need an update (I heard they already renovating some rooms) The food takes a while but very nice. The menu has a lot to offer which maybe is not necessary. Easier for the cook :) Staff is very nice and helpful. There's only wifi at night, good to know if you need wifi. And check out is early in the morning, but only because the kids have to go to school."

We are four people and we had very great time at Waecicu for a week. Staff was very pleasant and helpful. The kitchen was wonderful, nice setting and taste, Especially the breakfast with homemade fresh bread and different every day. it's easy to organize trip from the hotel, we went to Manta Point with Captain Lahi, who has Manta eyes and had the luckiness to swim with the mantas for hours. The team on the boat was also efficient and prepare able to prepare great food. We took the connecting bungalows with the sharing terrace, so the evening with the view, the sunset and the beer was also wonderful. Waecicu see you next."
"Labuan Bajo","Hotel Waecicu Eden Beach","0","Rachel L","Bali, Indonesia","Very unpleasant - Don't be fooled by the cheap cost on Agoda bookings","I had a very unpleasant stay at this hotel.As I was travelling alone, I thought I would pay for comfort and safety at this hotel, but everything that was written, mentioned and advertised on Agoda are terribly misleading.As a diver, travelling solo, I am required to be at the harbour early in the morning and the dive boat only arrives back at Labuan Bajo by 6pm or 7pm depending on sea condition. It was EXTREMELY INCONVENIENT when I found out that I have to catch a boat from the hotel to the harbour and the only way to get back to the hotel is also by the hotel boat, which leaves the harbour by 6pm! I was not informed by the hotel owner that I will need to pay for every single ride to and fro. Once at night, the boat broke down and I was told over the phone that they will send me a motorbike to be picked up but of course, I will need to pay for the motorbike too! As a solo traveler, I was worried for my safety as I wasn't sure who is coming on the bike to pick me up and we had to travel across the mountains on dirt and muddy roads and narrow hilltop paths that is actually very unsafe. One slight wrong turn and we both will tumble down from the hill into the valley below. Almost the entire trip was in darkness as there were no street lamps and I was worried for my own safety should anything happen. The boat ride usually takes 30 minutes from the harbour to the hotel. On the bike, it was an excruciating hour and half! The hotel should be responsible and have other boat owners/operators contacts and should send an alternative boat!When my dive boat was late back to the harbour, I kept getting calls from the hotel staff harassing me on my whereabouts and reminding me that the boat needs to depart by 6 from the harbour. This is despite me calling them in advance to let them know that we will be late due to delays and once the engine broke down twice in the middle of the ocean, causing our arrival at the harbour to be delayed. AND DO NOTE THAT should you return late to the hotel, YOU WILL BE CHARGED EXTRA for the boat ride! Everything adds up and the service is not even great!As for my room, I was shocked to find that I had to climb up the hill, up about 7 flight of steep stairs to my room, which is more like a tree house. You may think it's rustic and cute but for the price that you will be paying, you are better off staying at some cheap hotel in Labuan Bajo and have the same type of accommodation. One night, there was a huge gecko that climbed into my room and it was really uncomfortable, not knowing if the gecko will get into the bed while you sleep. The room is too far away from the staff quarters or reception that I have no way to get help to get rid of it in the middle of the night. Also, be warned that there is no security at all at the hotel. The rooms are spaced away really far from each other and when I was there, I was told that I was the only guest. When I asked if I can be put in a room closer to the reception area, I was told to pay extra for the room. There are no other guests in the hotel and the hotel owner didn't care at all about my request but only knows how to ask for extra money.As for the facilities, there is only cold shower and this was not made clear in the hotel bookings description on Agoda. The shower spout was also clogged and it's extremely uncomfortable getting into the shower cubicle. The sink is even worse with water spitting out in a narrow stream. If you turn down the pressure, it becomes a painful trickle. The room is extremely basic with really old towel and the mosquito net stinks and is covered with gunk or droppings on the top. The staff even skipped house-keeping duties once despite me leaving my keys at reception and requesting for the room to cleaned up.There is no wifi at all. When I was at reception in the morning having breakfast and asked for wifi, I was told that wifi will only be turned on at night during dinner time. Again, this was not clearly communicated once again at the time of booking.There are also cats and a dog running freely around the hotel area even near the rooms. I am not an animal person and I don't appreciate having stray or domestic animals near the room or the place when I am having my meals. It's just extremely annoying seeing the cats jumping on the tables and chairs getting close to you to try and get food from the table. Overall, I think this hotel is a HUGE let down and extremely inconvenient. If you are staying here, you will be STUCK in the hotel. The boat only leaves for the harbour in the morning and there is only a return at 6pm. And you are required to pay for the boat trips. So if you head out to the harbour, you need to leave by 6.30 or 7am (the boat timing is inconclusive) and you will have to spend all day in Labuan Bajo until the boat returns back to the hotel at 6pm. So this means you will not be able to have dinner at Labuan Bajo. If you want to stay past 6pm, you will need to call for a motorbike or car to take you back via the hills where the roads are unstable and honestly very dangerous to travel on with no street lights. You will be paying a bomb for this transportation costs also.For what you will be paying at this hotel, you are better off paying less in Labuan Bajo and you get the same basic stuff but you will be able to experience more freedom of movement around the town area for F&B and just hanging out with ppl that you meet, without all the transportation hassles and having the hotel staff hounding you to return to the harbour as soon as possible as the boat will be leaving for the hotel and you will end up having to look for your own transportation by land back to the hotel.It is extremely inconvenient and frustrating dealing with all of this while staying there."

We assumed the quality of the hotel would be reflected in the price that we paid, but we couldn't have been more wrong .We got picked up by a friendly worker from the hotel , who drove us to the harbour from the airport , and then took us on a boat to where the hotel was . We arrived at the hotel and it was very empty , and almost felt a little aqquard and uncomfortable , as the four workers could barley speak any English , it was very hard to communicate with them . When we eventually got taken to our room, we were surprised to see how dirty it was , there was some sort of rat/mouse poo in the mosquito net , ants everywhere , the shower absolutely stank of sewage , and was generally unpleasant in every aspect . The only good thing about the room was the view .The day after we arrived , we went into Labuan bajo to arrange to go diving , when we wanted to be picked up , we called the hotel and asked them to pick us up... we went down to the harbour and waited for an hour and a half , no show. so we called them again from the dive shop. They then told us they had ran out of petrol and couldn't pick us up , again , the broken English was clearly a problem . We ended up having to get some random locals to take us , which we paid a lot of money for because we were quite frankly sick of being stuck on the harbour in the boiling hot weather .We paid already for three nights with agoda , but left after getting back from booking the dive as we just wanted to get out as soon as possible . They still insisted we payed the $60 bill even though we payed for three nights and only stayed one .Stay away , don't be fooled by the tactful pretty photos on here."

I read most of the reviews on the place so was able to adjust my expectations accordingly. Here’s what I expected from the reviews and found to be true:—wifi is only on from 7-11 PM and only accessible in the lobby. Connections range from good to non-existant. —service is very slow. But staff often ask you to order ahead of time which was helpful to do. As long as you know it will be slow, you’ll be ok. —waiters don’t speak much English so it’s hard to get much information than what’s on the menu. Not all items are available at all times.—lots of plastic bottles on the beach but not in front of the hotel—rooms are basic but cozy and quaint.—great views. —love sitting on my balcony overlooking the islands. —dog still there. not friendly. best to leave him alone. Here’s what I didn’t expect:—water pressure was fine—electricty runs 24 hours—staff is very friendly and happy. Ferdinand is a hard worker and speaks better English than most of the staff. —there is an information board in English in the lobby orienting you—nice, fairly deserted beach —nice lounge chairs and bed-like platforms to lie on—steps up the hill are decorative and well designed; and not that bad to climb (I’m 65 and not in the best of shape; was in room 5 which is 3/4 the way up the hill).—romantic place—while I was there, most of the guest were French couples with young kids so it was much more family oriented than I had expected. —some days the place empties out during the day so it’s relatively quiet; other days there are more families around so it’s more energetic.—no mosquitos at all—although there are separate bungalows I could hear my neighbors quite clearly at times; especially in the morning—great massage by Tuttie for less than $12 US for an hour"

Honestly I am a bit disappointed with the view, I mean all the photos show how green the hills around the hotel and all we got was bald barren savanna with couple of trees here and there, but it's the season so what can we say. If you want that green hills around, just don't come in this season.The restaurant is very cozy, I really really love how they decorated that place, so natural and so Indonesia. The climbing path leading to the rooms are narrow but well paved and full of flowers and vines, it is beautiful indeed. The view from the upper rooms are also wonderful, I love it. You have the sea view with scattering nearby islands, and sunset! Farther, you can see the town Labuhan Bajo. They have this boat which drop and take guests in Labuhan Bajo and the time is flexible, they will arrange it every single day depend on the guests that may use it. Snorkeling right in front of the restaurant :) but not a really good snorkeling spotUnfortunately, the shower booth's door can't be closed so I kept flooding the bathroom. The bathroom door also can't be closed which is a bit disturbing. I think this is a matter of maintenance. The food in the restaurant is so so, I had grilled fish. Considering that there are no other place to eat nearby, I think they can upgrade the taste, enough variations though."

Better to order food in advance, but it's holidays.You can also have lovely massage there, the only place with a spa around.

"Labuan Bajo","Hotel Waecicu Eden Beach","0","maceface100","Witney, United Kingdom","For the views, you should stay here, but, be prepared before you go!","Getting a boat to this hotel was perfect. A boat is recommended rather than a taxi that can take 30 minutes on dodgy roads. The boat took roughly 15-20 mins and we organised this by emailing phil the owner in advance who got back to us pretty quickly.The view of the hotel from the boat is stunning, so pretty and quite isolated, perfect for a honeymoon setting or a quiet get away. If this review was based purely on looks, it would get 5 stars.If you like being served quickly and need wifi all the time- don't go here!! If you understand the slow pace of the food preparation in Indonesia and don't really want any distractions from the internet, this is your place!If I stayed again, I would take snacks. It can roughly take 1 hour to get your food. Which is fine when you realise, so you order at 5pm before you are hungry!The wifi didn't work at all during our stay, but we didn't need wifi so it was ok. Other people staying at the hotel walked to the next resort to get food and this seemed a good choice for them.We did ask for a Massage price list as the hotel claims to have a spa, however the young staff didn't understand at first, then tried looking but then gave up. I did hear three guests say they had massages booked the next day though, so I think we were just unlucky! Our shower didn't work at first but this was fixed very quickly. There was also rotten wood on the floor boards which will need fixing otherwise could become dangerous.So, be prepared before you go, take snacks, take a book, take some cards, relax, take life slowly and have a great stay. We only stayed for one night, I think it could become a little boring for more than 3nights but you can get daily boats to Labuan bajo."

Individual cabins set up the hill side. Opted for a cheaper room (fan and cold water instead of air con/hot water) but absolutely fine very clean and fantastic views from a bit further up the hillside. They organised a two day/one night boat trip to Rinca/Komodo which was a little dieselly, but a fantastic trip with great food, views and phenomenal snorkelling (will organise snorkelling kit for you if required). Food/drinks in restraunt vert good, but not that cheap and a bit limited to what they had got from the market that day. Overall though a fantastic time was had!"
"Labuan Bajo","Hotel Waecicu Eden Beach","0","Joshua M","","Very beautiful place, great food!","We stayed at this resort for 7 nights. The beach is beautiful despite the random trash that washes up from Labuan Bajo. It is quiet and very secluded. There are a few other small resorts around, but it is still not built up. The owners were very kind and even bought us a huge red snapper for our last night. It was the best tasting fish ever! The breakfasts were tasty with your choice of crepes or ommeletes. Both meals come with coffee/tea and fruit. Way too much food, but we ate it all every day.The only come to this place was that you could not see the sun set (you could hike up the hill about 20 minutes and see it from there), and there a lot of stairs. We had our daughter of two years old with us so carrying her up 170 stairs multiple times a day really adds up. I believe mount Bromo was only 200. That being said, we were at the top and the views were pretty spectacular. It was just a hassle if you forget something in their room...Anyhow, much recommended if you want something quiet with beautiful views."
"Labuan Bajo","Hotel Waecicu Eden Beach","0","Steckelbach","Bilbao, Spain","Unpleasant stay","The hotel has a lot of enchantment and the location is beautiful but it has too many downsides because the owners are letting it down without even caring. - Safety: Although the prices of the bungalows are ok, be aware that none of them have a proper lock. After 7 nights and despite several claims (obviously we were worried about our valuables), not even the owner was capable and/or willing to change a simple lock. - Access barrier: a dirt road not even doable by rented motorbike takes pedestrians over a 2h walk to Labuan Bajo (closest place for restaurants or ATMs etc.) - Internet connection: although the owner told us on the phone there was literally ""wifi in the rooms"", upon arrival we had to figure out ourselves that Internet (if working) is connected ONLY from 7 pm until the last guest leaves the restaurant and ONLY in the restaurant. The owner also lied to other guests telling them the same story about internet in the rooms. -Restaurant service: even though the food is an interesting blend of French and Indonesian cuisine, the orders take way too long plus food is not always guaranteed. When they have a more profitable plan, ""shopping in the market was impossible"" because the boat was being used ""to take clients to Rinca island"", as a waiter told us. In the meantime, because the guest has NO OTHER CHOICE but to eat in the hotel, he has to put up with the only option available: Nasi Goreng or to starve until dinner and see if any new surprise comes up. We went to town right after lunch to get a good pizza for dinner at one of the Italian restaurants. - Hotel staff is overwhelmed with two tables in the restaurant. When you sit down, the waiter can easily let you wait for 10-15 min until he approaches you to ask you what you want. Usually you have to look for the menu yourself before you sit down. After a drink, you are not asked if you would like another or if you would like any dessert. Initiative always has to come from guests in the first place. - Poor management due to no professional leadership whatsoever: Guests claims are ignored until after a couple of days you have to insist on talking to the owner himself hoping to get any further. Also in the kitchen, the mess is obvious: they filled sugar containers used during breakfast by guests with ground gelatin one day. It happened to have the same aspect as brown sugar. After an unsweetened coffee and a quite unpleasant feeling in my mouth, I don't get any answer about what the hell had been put into the sugar container. I had the feeling I had been eating glue, not something a traveler would like to experience during his holiday. - Better check your bills every day: One of the days we spent in town we were charged several dishes and drinks while we were away. We found out I. The check our day. - Room service: You have to ask for the room service every day. When we left our keys in reception for them to fix the lock (which after 7 nights eventually was never done), the room service was also skipped, since ""they didn't have the key"". - After all these things mentioned above and having talked to the owner about only some of them, the receptionist in the last 3-4 days completely ignored us: He said neither hello nor any good bye, tossed our breakfast on the table and desperately tried to avoid our presence... It was terribly uncomfortable. We decided to spend most of the time away or in town just to avoid the negative vibes. "

The location is secluded and quiet with view to the open sea, just nice for a romantic getaway. Built on a cliff side, the many steps/staircases are unavoidable but they were designed in such a way that it became part of its charm. Other than snorkeling right in front of the hotel, we would also highly recommend climbing to the hilltop. The sunset view from there is just breathtaking! Just don't stay on the top for too long after sunset as it goes dark really fast. The food are great, with steamed fish quickly became my favourite. Yes, the restaurant service can be quite slow and the room cleaning are done by request. However we didn't really mind much since we're not in a rush anyway, and whenever we request for our room to be cleaned it's always done properly. We simply accept that life goes slower over there.We had such a great first impression that 2 years later we decided to get married there! Now in 2013, we were excited to share the same magical experience with our family & friends. It doesn't hurt that now the electricity is 24/7 too. The owner, Phil & Dewi, are very helpful with the wedding preparation and basically taking care of almost everything. Dewi herself cooked a great dinner feast and we can't be happier. They even surprised us with a bungalow freshly renovated just for our wedding night! To say that we're deeply touched is an understatement. The staff were also very helpful and attentive that by end of the weekend it feels like we're all part of a big family.In the end, this place might not have a 5-star hotel service & facilities. What it has, however, is heart. It is now officially one of our favourite place and we are already planning to go back for every anniversary. This might be the start of a new family tradition."

"Labuan Bajo","Hotel Waecicu Eden Beach","0","HeatherfromCanada","Singapore, Singapore","Nice spot, fab view, but a few foibles - read this & know what to expect!","My husband and I stayed 5 nights in September 2013. We were only planning to stay 3 but extended when we realized how relaxing the place was - and what a great view! The info on pros & cons below will help you avoid surprises. There are, after all, only a few beach resorts around Komodo National Park to chose from, some really rustic and other's really expensive. This one's a pretty good mid-range option.BOOKING:Pros - The owner Philippe was congenial when we e-mailed to make the reservation. Owing to the lateness of our booking he didn't require a deposit and accepted cash payment at the time of departure. Cons - None.AIRPORT TRANSFER:Pros - One of the staff from the hotel met us at the airport and escorted us by van (10 minutes) and then boat (20 minutes) to the resort. Cons - The resort owns boats but not cars. Pick-up is by hired bemo (somewhat decrepit vans used for pubic transport) which is a cultural experience. To reach the boat we had to step over fetid puddles of fish guts at the Labuanbajo fish market. We were a bit miffed that the boat didn't depart for some time (20 minutes added to the transfer time) - we were left sitting on the boat speculating about the cause of the delay. Through experience we learned that Waecicu Eden Beach boat departure times are notional at best (thankfully with the exception of our return airport transfer). Later we also learned that the resort's boats have absolutely no lights, so for safety it's not recommended to travel in them after dark.ACCOMMODATION:Pros - We were absolutely delighted with our clean, well-constructed wooden bungalow. The view from the two picture windows and the balcony was superb. The property, though steep, is well-designed and nicely landscaped with a variety of trees and flowering shrubs which attract birds. There was no AC in our room but we didn't need it (or even the fan) as the hillside is breezy and not too hot at night, even under the mosquito net. The cottages, the panoramic view, and the remoteness from other developments were so good they compensated for other deficiencies in the resort.Cons - There is no information available in the room (or in the restaurant for that matter) about the resort or activities to do during your stay. Electricity is available only when the generator is on, and the noise from the generator makes you wish it wasn't on (but we understand mains electricity will be available soon). The electrical outlets in the room are terrible: plugs fall right out of them. We ended up using lengths of duct tape to try to get our chargers to stay plugged in. There is no safe in which to keep valuables. If you want your room to be cleaned you need to leave your key with one of the staff. There is no hot water. The water supply is full of minerals which clog up the shower head. Some guests complained of mosquitos, but they weren't a problem in our room - maybe because of the handsome, big geckos that kept us company at night! Some guests complained about those too because of their loud chirps, but they along with the morning roosters added a certain ""close to nature"" ambiance to the place :-) RESTAURANT:Pros - The good quality food is a hybrid of French and Indonesian cooking. The salads, based around kale because lettuce is not readily available, are healthy and good. The fresh fish, marinated in a secret barbecue sauce and grilled slowly over the coals is the specialty. Packed lunches of nasi goreng, soft drinks & fruit are available for day trips. Beer, wine, and pina coladas are there to quench your thirst. Water bottles can be refilled with mineral water at a reasonable cost so you don't have to use more plastic bottles, which are a scourge on all Indonesian beaches & waterways. Cons - The tasty breakfast of crepes with chocolate sauce, fritters, french bread, fruit salad, and coffee or tea is good but it's the same every day and there is no option for protein. You have to order your meals in advance or you end up waiting a long time for food to be served. Supplies have to be brought in by boat from Labuanbajo so availability of some menu items is limited depending on which ingredients are on hand. SERVICE:Pros - The team arranged excursions for us by boat to Rinca Island to see the Komodo Dragons, to snorkel at several good reefs inside & outside the national park, to watch the flying foxes take off in their thousands at dusk from the mangroves, and to see a traditional tribal dance performance in town. We were also able to rent a canoe with kayak paddles to explore the bay in front of the resort. Prices were reasonable and the boat captains & staff who accompanied us were competent. There is also a spa built a few steps up from the restaurant which offers massages & other relaxing treatments. Pity that the beautiful Japanese-style wooden spa tub is not operational!Cons - The owner was in the dining room entertaining a table of other guests when we arrived but did not greet us, nor did he bid us farewell when we left. We would have appreciated receiving a welcome & briefing. The local staff don't speak enough English to be able to explain much or answer questions. We had to wait until evening to speak to the owner about possible activities. Evening is really the only time he's around, and even then he seems rather indifferent about the running of the place. I don't think we saw him smile once. The gaggle of young staff are nice enough and have good intentions, I'm sure. We were surprised to learn that they are graduates of the local ""tourism high school"" give how singularly ineffective they are at providing service to the resort's guests. Granted, they have limited exposure & don't get paid much; nonetheless, training on the most rudimentary aspects of customer service, like bringing menus when guests arrive in the restaurant and taking orders for food & drinks, could really benefit them. Nothing seems to get done on time, including cleaning up last night's mess before the guests start arriving for breakfast. The staff's lack of professionalism as they hang around smoking, texting their friends, and gossiping with the girls in the kitchen is maybe unsurprising in this laid-back place but still unacceptable. Whereas the staff's nonchalance might be acceptable at a backpacker place, at a mid-range resort guests have every reason to expect a modicum of service.BEACH:Pros -Come on in - the water is fine! The garbage that previous reviewers complained about has been cleaned up. Snorkeling, swimming, and canoeing are all possible in front of the resort. There is some coral and colourful fishes (nothing compared to the reefs in Komodo National Park but OK). Cons - None, really. We didn't spot any poisonous sea snakes and only one jellyfish. Sea urchins are present, but easily avoided. It's a nice beach! It's the location that makes the resort worth visiting, despite its foibles.ADVICE: Come to Waecicu Eden Beach with an open mind and a relaxed patience. That way, you are sure to enjoy your stay."
"Labuan Bajo","Hotel Waecicu Eden Beach","0","Kris S","Sydney, Australia","STAY...... AWAY!","Very disappointing experience. Transport from the airport to the resort was seamless and without problems, but as soon as our boat got closer to the bungalows, we could see bushfires around the place the closest less than 25 meters from the wooden buildings... Not uncommon in the area and not something you can blame the owners for - I agree and not the reason for the negative review. It was the way they handled the situation: First of all they wanted to get us out of the boat without explaining what was happening, how long it was already burning etc... Not even asking if we were comfortable going into a place when we had no idea what the bushfires were going to do next. We didn't want to leave the boat as there was only one shuttle a day and we didn't want to get stuck. Second another family who stayed there came out for their transport back and told us electricity was out and they didn't get any food since breakfast at 7am (it was 3pm by then!). We decided not to stay as I couldn't imagine having a good night sleep with potential bushfires rushing up to the wooden huts. Again... More a personal choice. The fact they let us wait on the boat in the sun for more than 1.5 hours (without telling us more or offering any alternatives) after we told them we want to go back and would pay for the transport + the owner coming down - visibly upset - and asking us in an unfriendly (read rude) way what the problem was... (The place around is on fire, everything smells of smoke, ... maybe?) That didn't feel like hospitality you expect on holiday. There are something you don't have control over (like bushfires), but you definitely have control how you handle your guests."

Phillip, the owner, and his manager are possibly the worst h","DO NOT GO NEAR THIS PLACE.1. ""We'll then we won't allow you to leave"" - this is what we got told for questioning an item our bill where we had quite obviously been ripped off on. Large fish 65k on the menu, charged us 225k for X-large fish. The word ""extra"" was never said by anyone and does not appear on the menu. 2. Manager and owner subsequently abused us verbally.Phillip refused to organise us a boat back to lubuan bajo.we were forced to walk back to lubuan bajo. One can only get there by boat (which they chatge you 100k for one way!) so without say the walk was long and difficult.3. Once you are ""stuck"" at weacicu , you have to eat their food. stay cost us 38 dollars per night. One can stay in lubuan bajo for 20 dollars and eat amazing seafood cooked fresh from the market at less than half of what Phillip tries to charge you. (And that's just the cost on his menu, let alone the cost he decides to put on the bill)4. Right at the top of the resort is where the manager Phillip stays in an enormous house. But he cannot find the time to come down and greet guests and when we wanted to discuss our bill he did not come down and talk face to face. Instead he got his minions to argue and then literally abuse us and laugh at us when we did not agree.5. The beach is nice, but rather stay at other resorts on Eden beach or being developed nearby.6. when we mentioned putting a review on trip advisor Phillip initially said trip advisor is for ""weak people"", but subsequently he did try change his tune (a tiny bit) But it was too late after all the abuse we recieved.DO NOT GO NEAR THIS PLACE."

Not many guests were at the hotel which was convenient as we could enjoy ourselves in a peaceful and spectacular surrounding. The hotel, which consist of wooden bungalows, is situated on the hill by the seaside so the area is just wonderful with stunningly beautiful views. The water is very calm so you can take a canoe and paddle to small islands nearby, go trekking or just relax on the beach in a hammock. The design and architecture of the hotel give a lovely atmosphere to the place as everything there is made of wood. The staff is very nice and friendly, cheers to Conrad and Walter, they will make the best grilled fish you have ever tried! Literally, the grilled fish is a must! The best way to reach the hotel is by boat as it is an isolated spot with no direct road and electricity. I think it adds charm to the place but no worries, they have their own generator that works in the afternoons and boats that run between the hotel and the city centre. Just ravishing place if you want to escape from everyday life!"

The hotel is owned by French Philippe and his wife Dewi from Sumatra. The bungalows are all made of natural building materials and each bungalow has a spectacular view over the bay. All surrounded by a variety of flowering plants, tropical birds and Coral right in front of the hotel. The beach is very clean, the hotel staff cleans up every morning after the tide has brought in floating plastic debris, one of Indonesia's main problems. The water is cristal clear and shallow, safe for small kids. The hotel staff is friendly and very helpful. The restaurant offers a mix of Franch and Asian cuisine, can recommend delicious fresh BBQ fish and Soto Medan. The hotel has 4 boats, for trips to Labuan Bajo - 20 minutes - and/or for daytrips. They have one boat for longer trips, sleeps 6 persons, very comfortable. We rented that boat for a 2-day trip to Komodo and other outlying islands, all day catering on board, visiting local fishing communities, swimming with Manta Rays, snorkling at various locations. There is no wifi yet, but supposed to be installed soon. Can recommend this hotel to all who love nature and peace and quiet :)"

The rooms are built into the cliff and boast the most stunning views and sunsets we have experienced. The beach has crystal clear waters and good snorkeling areas. If you are looking for isolation and seclusion then this is perfect for you.The only negatives were if you did fancy exploring Flores it does take a speed boat to transport you to nearest civilization and a cost every time. Rooms were basic and although comfortable and worth a stay it is not for any travelers who maybe worried about ants as we had the, falling from our roof! Also adjust your patience to 'island time' as food can often be up to an hour to wait for.The family running the hotel, as well as the staff, were so nice and helpful it made our stay.

There is a lot of climbing to get up to your room if you are in the upper parts, but there views are probably worth it. Food was good. As some of the reviews have mentioned, the service was sometimes slow but it suits the aesthetic of the place.Unfortunately power is by generator which means there is a slightly less-than-peaceful hum when it's on. Also, it's not on through the night so the room would get uncomfortable hot a times. One other disappointment was no fault of the establishment, but periodically the waters were quite filled with trash probably drifting in from Labuan Bajo.Staff was great with special thanks to Jan."

It is quite fun also to ride a raft to reach the beach. (by the way, this hotel is only accessible by a short boat trip from Labuan Bajo. The road is not accessible during my stay there)The food is okay if you are familiar with French style. I'm quite surprised to find grilled fish seasoned with thyme outside the big city in Indonesia.For breakfast, the crepes is delicious.If you are willing to stay at the higher room, the view is beautiful. Don't worry about how to bring your luggage (the stair is quite high), because the assistant will help you to bring your luggage."
"Labuan Bajo","Hotel Waecicu Eden Beach","0","ianmacd44","Sydney, Australia","Great location, fantastic staff but maybe not the best place in the wet!","Beautifully located - our room was worth the climb for the view. The staff were great here - Conrad who met us at the airport and was really helpful during our stay and also Jan, who could not do more to help. Rooms are interesting in construction and when electricity is connected, issues of darkness, lack of power for fan, lack of a/c will be rectified (in a month or so???) Biggest issue for us was that we were there in the wet season and uncharacteristically heavy rains (edge of cyclone on Australia's north coast?) and our verandah was too wet to use, our room to dark to read. It is an ""eco-resort"" and as such, offers a great setting, views, access to beach, snorkeling, boat trip to Rinca Island to see the Komodo dragons (for a fee). In our view, it does need to offer more in the way of a few basic comforts e.g. a torch in the room.Given that there is little access to other places to eat (short of a boat trip back to Labuan Bajo), the menu could be better - too much fried food for our tastes, but grilled fish was excellent. Important if you choose to stay here to be realistic about comfort levels. If you want a/c, hot water (not an issue for us), access to more choice in dining, then stay in Labuan Bajo. If you want eco-resort experience, then this is worth a couple of days."
"Labuan Bajo","Hotel Waecicu Eden Beach","0","CT_Mtn_Biker","SIN","Quiet stay with beautiful view","My wife and I stayed here with another couple for 3 days before heading out on a liveaboard snorkeling trip and overall we were very pleased. The owner was very responsive to my questions via email and pickup was arranged at the airport without any issues. The boat ride out to the hotel was very nice and we had a great meal of grilled fish picked out by the owner's wife (and hotel chef) before we left Labuan Bajo. It was excellent! The food was good overall and food and drinks were reasonably priced but the grilled fish was the hands-down winner on the whole trip. The staff were all very friendly and helpful at all times and the bungalows were well-built and nicely decorated. The hillside faces west and so the views and sunsets were GREAT. The beach, water, and snorkeling right in front of the hotel were very good - no turtles but I did see 5 spotted eagle rays in the deeper water past the boat anchorages and plenty of fish, sea stars, and coral.As stated in other reviews, the rooms (bungalows really) are all on the side of a nicely landscaped but very steep hill so be warned stairs are part of the experience. It was very hot and not very breezy while we were there so the sleeping was difficult for me with limited windows to open (the biggest picture windows were fixed) and no power (after 10-11p) to run the fans. Not a huge deal overall but do be aware. The mosquitoes were really, REALLY aggressive when we were there (late December) so bring DEET and/or pick up mosquito coils in town. The coils seemed to be the most effective.Overall we all really liked the place and would definitely go back. With the discovery that the mosquito coils worked well we were able to relax more (mozzies love my wife) and really enjoy sitting down in the dining room in the evenings eating, drinking, and playing cards. If you are a little bit adventurous (and you must be as you are visiting the area!) this is a very nice place to stay."

"Labuan Bajo","Hotel Waecicu Eden Beach","0","wondercatUk","Hove, United Kingdom","Beautiful views, mixed feelings about hotel...","We stayed at Waecicu Eden Beach in May 2011 at the end of our trip across Flores. Because we had been staying at extremely basic places, we were pleased to arrive somewhere we could relax and stop for more than one day. We were welcomed the staff helped us carry our many bags up to our room high up on the hillside - we would never have managed it! The views from our balcony were amazing and worth the walk, but this place is not for those with difficulties with walking. Unfortunately I got a really horrible stomach bug the day after we arrived and was sick for most of my stay - not a bad place to stay when ill, apart from the steps and the lack of electricity and therefore fan in the room when I was ill in bed during the day. The staff were a mixed bunch. The assistant manager (I cannot remember his name sadly) was wonderful and made our stay. He was indonesian, the owner is french and a bit hopeless and not really very interested in the guests. There were a few issues we were concerned about, which really let the place down.One was hygiene - we twice saw a kitchen staff member leave a toilet without washing her hands in the sink outside. My stomach bug was worrying me and this made it worse. There was a large rubbish pile on the beach which was added to by the kitchen staff, for example cooked fish and any uneaten food was thrown on the pile. This smelt really badly at times and ruined time spent on the beach or in the hammocks.Toilet paper and towels was an issue a few times - with the cleaners forgetting to leave them in our room. This meant a long walk down to the restaurant to ask and a long walk back again, not great when feeling unwell. It is a beautiful spot on Flores, but a little difficult to get to and from -you have to ensure you arrange the boats to Labuan Bajo - not a great problem for us as we preferred to stay at the hotel most evenings, but if you fancy nights out - could be tricky. There was a final issue with us arranging our transport to the airport, they forgot to book the car we paid for and we ended up having to find something in a hurry."

The hotel location is right on a cliff which offers an amazing view from the rooms. The stairs are steep, it's a good work out if you need some! Rooms are very nice made from with really good wood quality. Cold water and no electricity at night as infrastructures at Labuan Bajo are quite poor, but you are in paradise so it makes your stay more adventurous!We went for a 3 days boat tour, we loved it, but don't expect any kind of comfort, just enjoy the time with your friends. Some snorkling trips we did out there were one of the best I've seen (and I've seen a lot).Philippe the owner is a bit shy but he is a really nice guy, he is very interesting and his wife who speaks French fluently is very kind.To put it in a nutshell, if you are looking for remote holidays in a great place, there you go.PS: I would suggest to clean every morning the beach in front of the hotel and on the sides as well.

The resort got more and more beautiful as we approached it on the boat. It looked like a real paradise set in the hills and beach. We couldn't believe the cheap price we had paid was for this paradise.The restaurant/bar/lounge area was very nice and we were brought a welcome drink. Unfortunately we were told nothing about the hotel itself. They could do with a better front face for the hotel; the guy who greeted us wasn’t very smiley or forthcoming with information.We were helped with our bags up the steep steps to our twin bungalow high up the hillside. A pretty tiring walk if you’re unfit, elderly or have an injuries so make sure you are aware of this when you book (or maybe ask for a low room). The walk was worth it for us however as the views just got better and better. Our new home for 2 nights was like a hidden treehouse, with entrance from underneath and a hammock to relax and look at the view.We were aware from reading other reviews that there was only cold water and that the electricity was available up to 11pm so I won’t let that be too much of a negative as we knew what we were getting with that, but I will just say that without any AC, we really needed our fan to be working when we were in the bungalow… and the electricity was off more than it was on, so we got very hot in the room. Being so far from any staff areas we could have done with a phone too… There were heaps on trash scattered around on the beach… why? This was a truly beautiful beach and hotel, yet they let heaps of rubbish get built up and just leave them around… right next to the restaurant too. What a shame. The real let-down for us was the restaurant service. We waited 2 hours for our dinner to be served. My partner’s drink order alone took an hour to get… and then the drink was totally wrong! Truly shocking service. The guy who served us told us in conversation that the hotel is usually much busier (there were only around 6 people including us in the hotel)… we would really hate to see how long it takes to get your food when the hotel is busier. We were the only two people there when we ordered, and another couple came to the restaurant after about an hour and a half. We have no idea what can take so long. There was no one to ask for most of the time, no apologies, no awareness that we had been waiting so long…. When we did finally get someone to ask, he had no idea and just guessed at another 30 minutes. We would have left if we had waited this long in any other restaurant but unfortunately this was our only option.To be fair to the actual food quality, it was very nice when it was served… but to wait 2 hours just ruined the meal unfortunately.We arranged our return boat trip for the morning of checkout. The information did not get passed to the right people and we were running around trying to arrange it ourselves in the morning (whilst lugging our heavy bags down the steps with no help because no one knew of our departure / no phone to contact). We had another boat to catch for a trip to Komodo. Luckily a young girl was getting a boat ride to school so there was a boat being organised and we managed to get a lift on that… 15 minutes later and we would have missed it and missed our tour.We stayed for two nights and had the option of staying again a few days later after a Komodo trip, but we didn’t rebook for the negative aspects given above. We thought it was a real shame because it would be so easy for this Hotel to get a 5 star review. The views alone almost give it that… all they would have to do is not be a total let down in other areas… unfortunately the place really suffered with their service and so we can’t give the rating we thought we would upon arrival. So much potential and really disappointing – it could all be fixed very easily too. I hope they do fix them because it is a shame to waste such a beautiful place.Pluses:Good price for roomsGorgeous resort and roomsBeautiful views from everywhereMinuses:Cheap price is justified by the bad serviceRestaurant service was appallingService in general was badTrash on parts of the beachOnly cold waterElectricity hardly ever worked"

Yet as you're on holiday this is not too much of a problem, or is it? Especialy as the dining room is very nice and opens up to the see with again beautifull scenic views you can enjoy from each table.The owner, a French chap maried to a Javanese is very helpfull and gives extensive information over the region and possible activities.

Another aspect that can be annoying, but it didn't bother us is that after 11PM there is no electricity. Sometimes also during the day the electricity went on and off.

The buildings are beautiful but the rooms have small windows that prop open, no screens! The large picture windows do not open thus trap heat. Daytime electricity is intermittent and at night only until 11 p.m. Thus you sweat all night under your beautiful mosquito net with no relief! The outdoor eating area also does not catch the breezes so it is quite buggy. Staff did bring mosquito coils but nothing was offered until requested. Used dishes were not removed unless by request and some remained overnight on the tables every night. The beach was okay--but it should be raked of trash. On our second day the outdoor toilet broke--the staff were poking at the tank on the beach, but it still didn't work on Day 3 and no signs were put up so it was pretty awful. Last but not least, the food looked pretty but was not very good. This is particularly frustrating because if you want to go to town to eat, you must pay Rps. 70,000 per boat ride. Finally, when you leave, the boat brings you only to the dock and they charge another Rps. 50,000 to get to the airport. We strongly preferred Golo Hilltop(no, we are not affiliated, just happy customers)."

I found that I was looking for. Before we came to Waecicu for three nights, we stayed in other nice hotels at nice places in Bali and Flores. But this time we could really detach and relax completely. We recommend this hotel to everybody that is looking for an opportunity to spend a moment away from civilisation - somebody that appreciate the beauty and pureness of this place . When I read other comments, I read critiques like there are many mosqitos, many steps to the room or the noise of the generator. This is true. But I think that we shoudn't compare this special expercience with the comfort of other hotels. I love to pay this ""price"" and to experience a peaceful moment embedded in natures beauty. Our children (4 years and 14 month) loved playing on the beach (we found the most beautiful shells on this beach), in the wonderful and beautifully decorated restaurant or in the small house in the tree....personally I never forget the excellent grilled merou that I ate here, the very kind owner couple and the kind stuff.

We were travelling 2 months in Indonesia, and this place is in our top 3 (taking into account what you get depends on how much you pay for). The hosts were very nice with us, organizing trip in KOMODO and RINCA islands, and the service was great: indonesian staff calling us by our names, always smiling and helping us, for exemple to carry our luggages up to the bungalow, and make us feeling very comfortable). The hotel is very calm, and bungalows are in natural materials (wood, coconut...), and they are clean, when you arrive by boat you can see that this hotel has been built to respect the nature. The food is ok, specially the grilled fishes and the fresh fruit juices. The view from the bungalows is 180 deg on the sea, and as the slope of the hill is quite strong you did not see others bungalows from your own balcony."

"Labuan Bajo","Hotel Waecicu Eden Beach","0","Waddler","Perth, Australia","Great views, nicely done, beach a let down - read this for hiking directions too!","This is a quiet, relaxing place. The food is very, very good too.The rooms and restaurant area are very well designed and the views from the rooms are spectacular (although some involve a lot of stairs to get up and down if that is an issue for you - if so, the rooms with fewer steps don't have as good views).The main let down was the beach. The sand itself is a little coarse and has a greyish tinge and is not as attractive as on the islands near Labuan Bajo. But that's ok, the main problem is that there is a lot of litter on the beach. This becomes a big, big problem once you get twenty metres or so away from the resort either way which makes beach front strolls less than pleasant.But even in front of the resort some rubbish appears on the beach and sea - maybe we were just unlucky with the way the tides were working from Labuan Bajo so it may not always be like this.You can get return transfers to Labuan Bajo (about 20mins each way) with the boat waiting for an hour about US 13 dollars. This is during the day only.There isn't a lot to do here (which is kind of the point I think), but you can do a walk to the top of the hill behind the resort for expansive views over the bay and across the other side over Flores. The resort recommended this walk to us, but it is not at all marked and there is no real path.Its short and sharp, so doesn't take long. You take the steps up from the restaurant until they run out at the last building. From here, three paths run left. Take any. Within a minute they converge on a fanit path through long grass. Once that runs out after another couple of minutes you should notice a ridge a few metres above you. The task is to get up that ridge, but there is no path. I found it difficult to directly attack the ridge from here and found that if you walk along for another couple of minutes you can find a relatively easy way up (but still with a little scrambling).Once on the ridge, walk directly at the hills in front of you and within a minute you'll come to a four wheel drive track. Follow that to the left.After a few minutes there are a couple of left turns in the road where it is noticeably easier to access the hillside. Use either of these points to access the hillside.From here there are three hills to choose from, just make your way up any or all, the going isn't too difficult but again no path. Any of them you'll be up within ten minutes from the track. You can do all three within twenty."

We spent the days taking photographs, trekking around the surrounding hillsides, kayaking and just lounging around and reading as they have created a half dozen super comfy spots for chilling out. our room was great and the overall, the whole hotel is really quite beautiful and wonderfully built with loads of attention to the small details. Really the place borders on paradies, especially with the incredible view and the fact that it's a 20 minute boat ride away from Labuan Bajo, meaning that there was wonderful peace and quiet.The only things that we didn't like were all the flies which made daytime meals a bit bothersome, the often poor restaurant service (as noted in previous posts, this hotel helps out a local tourist school by employee high school students who want to work in the tourist industry. Unfortunately, this means that service is degraded though at the same time, it's an altruistic move).And finally, I was bitten by one of the hotel dogs. The owners were helpful in getting me to the hospital to get my rabies shots and tetanus shots and gave us a free night in the hotel as compensation. Unfortunately, they have seem to have no intention of doing anything about their dog. As noted in the previous post, previous guests have been bitten by this dog but the owners have done gotten rid of the dog. This is a big concern as Flores is well-known to have rabies and to have a biting dog at a hotel is totally irresponsible. If the owners had promised me they would put down the dog, then I would have given this hotel 5 stars, but even the last night that we left, they still had the dog in the restaurant amongst customers. Even if they love that dog, I hope they still do the right thing and get rid of it. You cannot have a biting dog at a hotel amongst kids (and adults). After I was bitten by the dog I could no longer snorkel or dive as I didn't want to get the bite infected, and this really impacted by trip."

The restaurant is just ok, breakfast consists of pancakes with chocolate sauce (because the owners are french) the rest of the food was basic but nice, we didn't like the amount of cats and dogs hanging around in the kitchen including on the preparation benches and under your feet in the restaurant.

"Labuan Bajo","Hotel Waecicu Eden Beach","0","Peter M","Gorinchem, The Netherlands","Superb location, restaurant and shower need drastic improvement","We stayed here in August 2011 for two days. The cottages/B&B are only accessible by boat and thus the hotel owner's boat picks you up at LabuanBajo harbour. The location is absolutely magnificent. Not easy you will find a location that is so peaceful, remote and restgiving. Use this hotel to relax for there is not much to do, because of its remote location. There are snorkle day trips the French owner organises but that is about it.About the restaurant: we had to order our dinner choice and a specific time during the afternoon so they could prepare it on time and so we did request our food at 7pm. Don't expect quick and good service. Often, we had to wait for longer than an hour but hey, its holiday right? It gets more annoying if you order food and they simply forget you and you finally have your lunch at 4.30pm.Anyway, the showers in the huts are horrible. We spoke to a lot of guests and they faced the same problem. Only 2 skinny beams of water to wash yourself isn't rare and the shower cube itself is more than small. Improvement here is more mandatory than recommended but I don't think that Philippe the French owner will renovate within a short period of time.So, enjoy the vast white beach only populated by the guests of the twelve huts and stay for two or three nights, don't mind the most horrible and smallest shower of Indonesia and simply wait for your food...to wait even longer. Don't get mistaken, the place and location are absolutely unsurpassed but Philippe could turn this place in a true Eden Paradise if he only would improve the restaurant's kitchen and workers and the showers.Philippe himself also does not know much about Flores so any inquiries about trips on/around Flores are useless. Instead, relax for two days and then move on."

We stayed in adjoining bungalows, ideal for a family, with a superb terrace between the two. The views from the rooms were sublime, and can be well seen on the hotel's website, www.waecicu.com. The casual restaurant is beachside with a great ambience and wonderful views.The hotel is run by french expat Phil and his lovely Indonesian wife, Dewi, who cooks beautifully. Phil will arrange trips on their large boat to Rinca and/or Komodo island, where the famous dragons can be seen, and local fishing villages and lovely deserted islands with exquisite beaches and coral, can be visited during the trip.This is remote Indonesia, so don't expect room service. There is no hot water, it's a decent walk up the hill (thru beautiful gardens) to the bungalows, and while the food is great, it takes a long time to arrive - Phil and Dewi deliberately offer experience to locals training at a nearby hospitality and tourism school, so be patient and understanding, while you await your meal in paradise."

Soon as we arrived in Waecicu, we're greeted by the friendly owner, Philippe and his beautiful little daughter, Nateyo. We booked Superior room but we got upgraded to the Honeymoon Suite, which has the best view. We stayed for 2 nights. The common room/restaurant is very comfy. Enjoying scrumptious dinner while watching Nateyo playing with other guest's children, making us feel like a part of a big family in Philippe's house. And we have to underline this once again, the food is AMAZING. We have been to many 5stars resorts, but this hidden gem of Labuan Bajo is the winner. Waecicu can also arrange day visits to Taman Nasional Komodo. They have private boats with friendly staff to take you to Rinca Island or to Mantaray point. You should bring your own equipment if you want to snorkel. Or if you want to dive, they'd be happy to assist you to other diving agent.Although there are some things that need to be done to improve the guest's comfort, like electricity, bugs, or room service. Nonetheless it's pretty understandable considering supply limitation in Labuan Bajo and the resort is still developing. After 2 nights, we moved to more upscale resort in Angel Island. Eventhough it wins in many sector, we don't feel as welcomed as in Waecicu. Angel Island feels just like another 5star resort. We soon missed coming back to Waecicu again. And we did.

It's a new hotel and so the rooms are very clean and fresh looking. I stayed in the cheapest option, but it was very adequate - there were mosquito nets over the beds and big windows looking out over the sea and the islands beyond - really stunning scenery. The bathrooms are simple but attractive in design (but would benefit from having a mirror!) Each bungalow appears to be slightly different in design and although they are all close together, each one has privacy. They all also seem to have either a balcony or an area underneath the bungalows with hammocks (which I really enjoyed). They have been beautifully landscaped into the hillside with lovely, well looked after gardens. The electricity goes off at night (from 10pm until about 7am) but the hotel provided a good torch and there was sufficient breeze to be able to sleep well without a fan or ac.There is a very nice restaurant on the beach although while I was there, the cook was away and so the menu was somewhat limited - the grilled fish cooked on the open fire though was delicious. (Some cushions on the low furniture would be a lovely additional touch!)The hotel provided a very efficient pick up service from the airport, although I had quite a wait at the harbour for the boat trip to the hotel. The service was very friendly rather than formal and I liked that - Flores is still in the early stages of tourism and so the quality of service is not necessarily what you would expect from a hotel in Bali for example - but their friendliness and genuine warmth made up for it and they became part of a lovely holiday experience.The owner organised my trip to Rinca, which was excellent, and I felt really well looked after, but I would recommend that more tourist information is made more readily available within the hotel. I loved the location - I was looking for peace and quiet and that's what I got. You can go walking in the hills behind the hotel (although a map would be useful!) There are also two old wooden canoes which are available to use and from the hotel you can easily get to the nearby island.It's about a half hour boat ride from Labuan Bajo and there are no other facilities in the area but the hotel can arrange a shuttle. I can imagine it would be quite a difficult place for someone with physical disabilities given the number of steps (167 up to my room! -the highest one) but otherwise I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a quiet and stunningly beautiful get away."

"Labuan Bajo","Green Prundi Hotel","0","Beckie E","Leicester, United Kingdom","Good value hotel","We stayed here for one night before, and one night after our Komodo boat trip.Whilst not in the centre of town, it is only 20-30 minutes walk and the staff will drive you to and from town for free.It's really handy for the airport being less than a ten minute walk. We stayed in a double room both times which was spacious and had a small balcony area. The bed was comfortable and the sheets clean although like lots of places in Indonesia the bathroom is quite old and basic. The first room we stayed in had a dodgy looking plug socket with exposed wires, and a squashed fly on the wall complete with footprint! The second room was much better.Their garden is beautiful and looks like a nice place to relax.The staff here were really helpful and friendly, and looked after our backpacks whilst we were on our boat trip. Overall we found the hotel to be good value as somewhere basic to stop for a night. I wouldn't recommend it for any longer as there really isn't much to do in Labuan Bajo other than arranging tours."

It's near the airport (in fact almost opposite) and they offer a free shuttle into town. They even pick you up when you get out of your restaurant on a simple phone-call. Rooms are ok, but only cold water in the (somewhat overpriced) standard room. Very basic breakfast. Wifi does not always work, but that is not their fault. Friendly staff. The owner is a catholic priest whom one can chat with about life on Flores."

"Labuan Bajo","Sylvia Waicicu Beach Resort","3","Matthew W","","Could be great but its terrible.","We just left this hotel and don't plan on returning in the future.The frustrating thing about this hotel is that it could be great of the people working there or the people running it knew what they were doing. The good.It's in a beautiful location and has a private beach. However, to get to the hotel you have to cross the bumpiest road I've ever been on and end up feeling sick by the time you've arrived.That's pretty much all that's good about the hotel.The bad.We arrived early in the morning and asked if we could have a little bit of food from the breakfast buffet, they refused as we hadn't paid for it... We could understand that but still thought it was a bit strange that we couldn't even have a coffee.We had booked a room with a double bed but when we arrived there were two single beds. Their solution... Push the two beds together. This was poor planning on their part and when they pushed the beds together the floor was covered in dirt from where it hadn't been cleaned.There was no hot water in the hotel, even though they advertise having hot water. Their excuse, they're fixing it.. Seems to have been being fixed for a long time.After arriving and having a shower we needed a hair dryer. We were a little surprised that there wasn't one in the room and even more surprised when they told us that they had 3 hairdryers in the whole hotel. We couldn't use one because they were locked away and the person with the key was out.The nightmare continued when we found out that the hotel was around 15 minutes away from the city, 15 minutes of bumpy roads.. The hotel do offer a shuttle bus to the city... 3 times a day... That's it. 3 times a day!! The bus to the city ends at 4.30 and if you want to get picked up or dropped off after that you have to pay 100,000 rupiahs. What a scam.There's no WiFi in the rooms here. The WiFi has to be used outside the rooms in the garden area. Even when the WiFi can be used its terrible. I'd say it was because of the location of the hotel but the restaurants in the city have great WiFi.We decided to try the food at the restaurant in the hotel. It was disgusting, bland and tasteless. We also found a hair in the food here, the waitresses did give us a new meal because of this. When we paid, the restaurant didn't have change so we had to end up without our fill change amount.We booked a tour and were due to arrive in the city quite early. We signed up for one of the free shuttle buses to the city which was supposed to depart at 6.50 am.. The driver didn't wake up in time and the bus left at 7.05, making us late for our tour.We were having food after a meal in the city and asked the restaurant to call to r hotel for a Taxi. They did and we waited, waited and waited for the hotel taxi to come.... It didn't come. We waited for 1 1/2 hours for the car to come. In the end we got our own, private taxi home. When we arrived at the hotel, I asked to speak to the manager, that request was ignored and the two receptionists started arguing about the number that was called. Horrific customer service. In the end they apologised and offered us free airport transfer outside of their usual 3 trips to the airport a day... Hardly good compensation considering most hotels offer an airport shuttle whenever you need it.Finally, there was an ant nest outside our room which the hotel staff seemed to have not seen somehow. It took them nearly 20 minutes to find some spray to get rid of the ants.Overall, this hotel is horrendous. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone visiting Labuan Bajo.. It is cheap but that doesn't make the horrific service, poor English level and their uncaring, unsympathetic approach OK.Please avoid this hotel."
"Labuan Bajo","Sylvia Waicicu Beach Resort","3","JH L","","Good facility, poor maintenance, away from the city center","First of all, this is 3~5 km way from the city center. If you get a bike taxi with 30K IDR, you can go thru on an unpaved way with thrill.The hotel is nice actually. Two hotel rooms are using one building. And it's the way to the beach in front of rooms. The swimming pool is pretty good with a view to the beach.But, you'll see many bugs from the garden nearby. And it's unable to see the beach from most rooms.If you walk 5~10 min from the hotel, there's Amelia Sea View and you can take a wonderful look from the hill."

"Labuan Bajo","Sylvia Waicicu Beach Resort","3","Bruce H","","There's pro's but mostly Cons","First off it's a fair ways out of town, on a pretty rough road. You need to rely on there shuttle buses which aren't free, you'll want to use the shuttle bus because the food at their restaurant wasn't very good. The staff were a bunch of kids that really didn't care.The front desk were indifferent and not really helpful. Except for an older guy that took care of the pool, he was their saving grace. The pool was A1We had a beachfront room which was a nice spot, I had to cover the shower drain with a wet towel to keep out a sewer smell, There's a security box in a closet that wasn't bolted down ??? The front door had good locking and security mechanisms, the back door was a joke. It's seems like the place was put up in a hurry without a lot of quality control. Or lights around your bedTHE GOOD Lots of lounge chairs , free use of some kayaks . A nice beach for tanning and chilling out. One of the best sunset views we encountered . Again nice pool>.Unless you've got aqua socks or booties forget about swimming there as it's all sharp rock/ coral bottom , pretty nasty. Don't let them arrange any tours etc.,, you'll pay way too much. Make sure you bring drinks and Bintangs from town because they'll gouge you.Whoever owns this place should fire the couple that seemed to be in charge and get some proper management and quality control. WiFI was awful"
"Labuan Bajo","Sylvia Waicicu Beach Resort","3","w w","Jakarta, Indonesia","Quiet and nice beach","We stayed at Sylvia Hotel for 3 nights and got the villa directly facing to the sea. The beach is very quiet and very clean (unlike Bintang Flores Hotel, also in Labuan Bajo). No hotel staff was around at all.The room is clean (the hotel is still new) and is totally 'empty'. No bathroom amenities at all. The soap holder is fallen half down. The mirror is broken.No interior designer was involved, therefore, the entire premises look bare."
"Labuan Bajo","Sylvia Waicicu Beach Resort","3","Pim v","","Worst.performance.ever.","Me and my friend stayed here for 3 days. And this is my first review I've written ever, so here goes:At arrival the staff hardly speaks english, when asked for a discount they litteraly give you the wifi code to book it trough booking.com for less, instead of changing the price at the desk. You will have to walk 200m from the beach to the lobby to pay 25k for a cola, and still pay 11% ->service<- charge extra. The power goes off when you leave the room and take the key card. So that's no nice airconditioned room to walk into an no phone charging. The fridge wall connector does work after you leave. But they disconnect the fridge between stays so you will have to keep it running for a day to have a nice cold temperature in it. The warm water is generated by an environentally friendly solar panel (if they are not broken and leaking), but you share 1 with your neigbours, so shower first, or cool your vastly overpriced beers in the shower. No toilet paper for your leaking, not so flushing toilet. The shuttle service is absolute terrible: 60k back and 60k forth per room per trip. And you have to keep their time table, once an hour I believe, wich they selfs don't keep. We missed the last one at 22:00. Called the vastly overpiced hotel, if the very overpirced shuttle would please come pick us up. But at 22:05 the bus driver was ""already home"". Then we arrived at the hotel thanks to some friendly locals wo took us in back of the pick up truck for 20k per person at 23:00 to see a full staff playing with their phones and doing nothing else. P.S. hire a motor in town. 70k a day, much more fun speed and freedom for less money. The food was just disgusting, must say I've only had breakfast but after that I didn't dare to order any food there. P.S. it takes 35 minutes to make a cup of thea. The 2nd time we arrived at 02:30, and we would not be using the included breakfast. Still had to pay 100%. They arrange trips to islands like Komodo and other fun stuff to do. But again money is the key. They charge 4.500.000 rupia per person (no spelling errors there), gets cheaper if you go with a group but still overpriced. (no spelling errors there) for the same day trip the locals offer for 500.000. By the way the best way to go on this: go with the diving centers they take you on 2 dives near komodo and to the dragons, full day trip for 1.200.000 rupia. Even for non divers this is the-best-thing to do. In the end the resort looks nice and the staff are kind people who enjoy their work, and like the guests visiting. But management ruins it all. The staff has gotten no training whatsoever, (not even english). And everything costs a lot. Cash cow for the boss, and we are the cows that get milked for the money. And it is a great business model. Pop a beautiful resort on a beautiful island at a great place, keep costs -very- low, and charge like you got michelin stars in the kitchen. But it makes for a terrible stay."

However people are friendly. Road is not as bad as some say. Maybe 2 stretches of 200m unpaved. Definitely very quiet. Wifi download and upload speeds are 2 Mbits/sec, usable.

The hotel was average, nothing special. Room was clean, but I have a problem with the shower, no hot water came up from the shower. No coffees or mini bar in the room, even they have fridge inside. Something's not right with the door, hard to open. The pool was a bit dirty. They have a beautiful beach side, but they didn't know how to make it more beautiful. They provided free kayak, but not well maintained. Fortunately, they gave us a free shuttle to airport and the staffs were lovely. Sylvia Resort still have many times to improve its standard, if they still want to preserved the rate."
"Labuan Bajo","Sylvia Waicicu Beach Resort","3","vee_vita","Seminyak, Indonesia","Good Location and Value","Sylvia Resort was a serene getaway. The hotel is 15 minutes away from main roads of Labuan Bajo, it is on Waicicu beach. They have transport to and from the main roads with additional charge of 60K per room. Airport transfers both ways are included, you need to notify them the time to pick you up at the airport (giving them a call is much preferable than drop an email as they didn't reply to mine). The driver, Niko, is nice and informative.Check in and check out were also quick. The room (I booked the garden view room) is nice and spacious with good air-con. The facility is good too: safe deposit box, TV, large closet, desk and chair, decent bathroom (unfortunately the hot water didn't work when I was there). Wifi is not reaching up to rooms, so gotta go to Lobby to get wifi access.Pool is average. But water is hard to get in Labuan Bajo, so it is a good thing that they have water in the pool. It was dry season but the staff maintained to keep the grass green (it is nice but I feel a bit sad for the water they got to spend).The beach is awesome, blue warm and quiet water. There is no wave, you can swim on snorkel right on the beach. They have free kayaks/ canoes to use but the condition is poor (life jacket and paddles are also in poor condition), there is no supervision too so you got to help your self. There are some sunbeds on the beach next to the pool and a swing from tire attached on a tree, cute.Breakfast was nice. Yes the option is limited but there weren't so many guest at that time so I guess they don't want to waste. Some areas (like gym, hall to lobby) need to be deep cleaned. The staffs are friendly and nice.Sylvia Resort Komodo could be better, the management need to improve the maintenance and cleanliness of the facility. I recommend this hotel for romantic getaway, adventure holiday and nature indulgent."

The hotel operates a shuttle service thats free if your arriving or departing but itherwise costs IRP 60,000 to get anywhere.Because the hotel is so far from anything this is the only option if you want to go into town or out for dinner.The location is lovely, the rooms were clean and had excellent hot water pressure.The snorkelling of the beach was great and they provide free kayaks.The food was not very good and service was slow.The pool looks great in the pictures but in reality is poorly maintained, looks like the filter doesnt work and was full of dead bugs and slime.Overall this was overpriced for the standard provided and a bit too far out of town."
"Labuan Bajo","Sylvia Waicicu Beach Resort","3","herbertirawan","Denpasar, Indonesia","perfect escape","If you are a regular traveler to major touristic areas, you may lower your expectation a bit. Having said that, we found Sylvia Resort to be a perfect place to stay. The place is almost literally hidden away from the main downtown areas (well, isn't that what resorts are all about?). It will take you approx 20-25 mins from the main areas of labuan bajo to reach Sylvia resort. The road leading to the area is also under major construction (this actually leads sylvia to limit their shuttle schedule to downtown areas. So better bring your supplies beforehand).The location is just perfect if you are looking for a quiet place with clean and calm beach. the pool, the beach, the spectacular sunset (must-see) are perfect. The staffs are also very accomodating. Our driver was a very friendly guy, Niko, who welcomed us well and gave us tips about the best and cheaper ways to get to komodo and the other islands nearby.Some of the other things we enjoyed: free kayak provided by the resort. Perfect to see sunset. They don't look well maintained though, some of the paddles are broken, so are the life vest. But It is pretty safe even in the absence of lifeguards, just make sure you don't paddle into expensive boats parked in the nearby islands, lol. We also enjoyed the pool, the room amenities are not bad either.All in all we had a pretty good stay. only downsides probably are the distance to the main city, lack of maintenance in some areas/facilities (loby, fitness centre, pool table at the lobby, kayaks), also no wifi in the rooms, otherwise Sylvia was awesome.I will definitely be back. Hopefully they managed to bring in new and better paddles for the kayaks."

DOWNs:- a bit of a downside is the location, about 15 minutes from LBJ village on quite washed out dirtroads- however it is doable on a scooter/ motorcycle (they are doing up the road atm)- lack of management everywhere!- Staff is not trained properly, housekeeping will leave the dirty dishes on the terrace for days- unless you tell them to clear it- Restaurant is also the reception area, Room service takes at least 40minutes to an hour, Food is quite average- Breakfast offers toast, asian noodels, white rice, fried rice, sausages, juice, coffee, fruit- not bad, however staff will not check the buffet or clear any dishes, so if you want more fruit, toast, milk,...- ASK/ TELL them.ALL in ALL:Snorkeling of course is not as amazing as in the National Park, however you can still discover a lot of underwater life and see amazing fish, or just chill on the beach and enjoy the view.

The surrounding area has no other options so i had many meals there.The food was very average.pool water was always dirty, think they do not work the mechanism for filtering. the days I was there, the beach was not suitable for swimming, had many seaweed and many rubbish (bottles, bags, etc.) So five days there, without swimming! The only good part of my stay there , was the help i had from a reception girl ( i dont remeber her name but i really thank her ). I had a big problem by incects bites, and no one could help me cause of the bad communication on eanglish . So she brought me some peals and cream from her home and i felt really better .

However two issues really affected my stay here. Firstly, as the hotel is quite far from Labuan Bajo, the hotel offers a ""free shuttle"" this service however is extremely unreliable (we waited 3 hours once for the shuttle, after booking a few days in advance). As there are no restaurants near the resort, the dining area of the resort is the only place to order food. The food served was quite poor, and the service, while friendly, wasn't the best. There is also no bar/kitchen near the beach or pool, and guests are required to go to the dining area for any refreshments. - A wasted opportunity.Additionally - the wifi is very dodgy!There is alot of potential for this resort, but there needs to be an upheaval in both transportation and kitchen management."

The rooms are clean and pretty basic. The location is about 15 minutes from the airport on a part bumpy dirty road. The good part is the location being away from the Main Street of Labuan Bajo so you escape the increasing numbers of backpackers and most of the tourists. The beach is nice and decent for swimming. The disadvantage of the location is you only have one restaurant choice at the hotel which is very average. The best bet is to arrange a car to go into Labuan Bajo for dinner. The staff at the hotel constantly seemed confused and struggled to make basic arrangements. If you seek a clean basic hotel in a quite spot, i would recommend this given the limited options still in Labuan Bajo."

Yes. the road is REALLY bad, but they are busy rebuilding it and will be great when finished. The room was fine, and the only reason to stay here is the wonderful, peaceful view. There was however no hot water in the basin. Our cooldrink glasses that were used on the first day were never washed in the 3 days we stayed there. The toilet paper was never replaced. One small soap for 2 people for 3 days. No shampoo, conditioner and body was, like all other Indonesian hotels. the safe in the room was locked and although we asked several times, it was never opened for us to use. The breakfast was of very poor quality - servers permanently empty and when replaced the would be only enough to serve 2 -3 people. Plates , cups and bowls have to be found in storage cupboards. Table clothes were filthy, with pieces of food stuck to it - every morning. Seviettes come in the form of a box of tissues on the table. Ordered food was tasty, but although the food was ordered by some one who speaks Indonesian, we did not get what was ordered. With no excuse. Do not be fooled by the bar. although it looks like a well stocked bar, all the bottles are empty. All we could order was beer, gin and tonic, and 2 types of soda. The pool is in 2 sections. While we weere there the one was empty and the other was grass green. The beach loungers are never tidied in the mornings and a beach bar is non- excistant. Also no mini bar. When we wanted to buy airtime for our mobile phone, we were sent to one of the waitresses by reception. She runs a very profitable business from her pocket - selling Rp10 worth of time for Rp15. Really in a hotel dining room?! After a snorkeling trip on day 2 , our key card did not work and the room was not cleaned. we were told that we were moving out that day although we has fully paid for 3 nights in advance. To top it all, it was the 2nd most expensive hotel we stayed in during our 6 week holiday in China and Indonesia. The others were all perfect. When we finally tried to check out, it took 3 credit card machines and 30 minutes to pay!!! Never seen such bad service and incompetance ever, and we should be used to it we're from Africa!!!!"

Lunch and dinner were good but food took ages to come with dining staff apparently ignoring you when trying to order as it was the minority of the time that we got the correct food we ordered.Rooms were a bit half finished although the pool area was of a much higher quality. Gym is just a selection of weights and 1 weights machine. The beach was nice although scattered with litter. The trips to Komodo and rinca are ridiculously priced- despite being on a private boat. each trip was more than 4 times the price of them if you book through a tour agent in town. Also, no wifi in our room. Only in public areas.Overall, quite disappointing. Looks good on the surface but massive cracks underneath!!"
"Labuan Bajo","Sylvia Waicicu Beach Resort","3","Lowesam","Bangkok, Thailand","Worth the derive for the views and tranquility","After staying one night in central Labuan Bajo and booking our diving trips, we hired mopeds and went in search of a swimmable beach for snorkelling. We saw an advert for this place and aware of it being a drive and a track to reach, we decided to move there for a few nights. We were so glad we did. The rooms are fine, but what made it ideal was the sand and view on our doorsteps. Beautiful scenery and friendly staff. There aren't any other restaurants in the vicinity but the food was fine and delivered to our beach front terraces. Wifi worked well in the lobby and even on the beach in front of the lobby, but not much signal in the beach front rooms.Gorgeous sunsets here.The swimming pool looked nice but we didn't use it, we preferred to swim in the sea and took the free kayaks out in the sheltered bay. Very comfortable beds, decent accommodation for the low price we paid. Ideal for a few days, or more!I'd definitely stay here again if I get the opportunity to go back to the Komodo islands."
"Labuan Bajo","Sylvia Waicicu Beach Resort","3","jjoyw19","California","Lovely pool, extremely quiet resort but far from town","My boyfriend and I stayed here for 1 night. I've got mixed feelings about the hotel... here's why.Positives:-The resort is literally on its own private beach. VERY secluded and very private. -The pool is lovely, nice and clean and feels refreshing to use after snorkelling in the ocean for 3 days prior to our stay at Sylvia.-Rooms are large, very modern, comfortable.-They have kayaks that you can use when you please, which made for a nice hour trip around the island.-Wifi is strong.-Great views and the sunset is quite beautiful.-If you are travelling with kids, its a kid friendly resort. Loads of families were there with like babies to teens. (I suppose this is a positive or a negative factor, depending on your preferences.)Negatives:-THERE'S NO BAR/FOOD SERVICE by the pool. To me this was totally absurd. Like, if you're going to trap your guests 20 minutes away from town in this resort, at least make the stay enjoyable by serving drinks (read: alcohol) and food by the pool/beach. They literally ONLY serve beer at this resort, and that's waaaay at the top in the lobby restaurant. They have a full bar in the restaurant, but I kid you not, we asked about why they don't serve cocktails w/ a full bar and they said the bottles were actually just left by guests and they filled them with water. WHAT?! This resort could be about 1000000 times better if they had pool side service and a bar.-It's almost too quiet. Like, there's no music. Most guests sit by the beach and read. It *almost* feels like you need to whisper.... I guess in other words, the ambiance is quite lacking. It's great if you're some inspiring author who wants to sit by the pool and write their book in silence all day, but the eerie lack of noise was a bit unnerving for me, haha.-The location is a solid 15-20minute drive from town. The road is very very bumpy and uncomfortable. The shuttle van they take you in doesn't leave terribly frequently (like every hour) and the last pick-up from town is early. It doesn't have AC, so it's a hot 20 min ride.Overall, the grounds are lovely, the beach is gorgeous, but it's just lacking atmosphere and service (food/drink). It COULD be great with poolside service and a bar though!"

The one day the water wasn't hot they checked and fixed it within 10 minutes. The beach is so beautiful and the Sunsets are spectacular.The big problem for now is the road which is still dirt and under construction. There is daily progress and once finished (They said September) it's an easy drive to the down town. Till then you're stuck and the menu is very limited. Try the Plataran down the beach on the right ( facing the water) excellent food."

","We stayed at this hotel for some much needed relaxation whilst travelling...Firstly let me say that the location is incredible! Stunning views, completely silent, beautiful and right on the beach. The hotel was also spotlessly clean with a gorgeous pool area.However it is a NIGHTMARE to get to. About 15 minutes from the main strip down the bumpiest road, most taxis will not go there or will charge a high price because of the drive.Staff are also questionable, we emailed to book the free airport pick up but nobody turned up and when we enquired as to why we were not given any explanation! At check in no one seemed to know about our booking and staff were quite rude demanding to see confirmations and emails. Eventually they took us to our room but the service was not great!Only ate at the hotel once and food was ok and fairly priced!All in all, worth it for the amazing location but wouldn't stay here longer than a couple of nights!"

Flew from Bali to Labuan Bajo, and just knew later that the hotel had a free airport picking up, after already asked a taxi from the airport to the hotel and paid 150,000 IDr (Indonesian Rupiah) or about $ 12. It rained on the day of arrival, but the worse was the location of the hotel. Needed to off road and drove among the muddy road and shower rain. The location of the hotel was private, that's fine. But the service was very poor. There were many staffs for doing nothing, or just many staffs to do for one thing ! Wifi was broke and could not install, even though we asked for help many times. The best poor was the food,..!! Just had a few bites; not fresh at all. Sounded so much isolated, eventhough hotel provided the shutter bus to the downtown and pick up, but also had to pay 60,000 IDr for picking up ....and with that muddy road, shaking head all the way longgggg..... I don't know what it look like in a high season, but .... pretty poor performance for this low season 2015.Checked out the hotel earlier."
"Labuan Bajo","Sylvia Waicicu Beach Resort","3","arminhari","Yogyakarta, Indonesia","Poor Facilities and Services with Beautiful Beach Scenery.","We stayed here for four days and five nights, after we searched hotel with beautiful scenery in Labuan Bajo, Flores, Indonesia. But what we had the contraries after we stayed there. The road condition from main road to this place is quite far terrible: ground road, slippery, bumpy, and sometimes puddle with mud. I couldnt imagine if it was in rainy season.Even though the hotel had explained that there would be shuttle mini bus from/to airport for the guests, but the transportation from/to the hotel to the central city was nothing. During the check-in, the receptionist didnt explain that for each transportation from/to hotel was not free at all. We're charged Rp. 60.000,- per each way, it mean that Rp. 120.000,- if you're planning to have supper outside the hotel. We're shocked when we're receiving invoice mentioned about that prices during check-out.Another thing very disappointing was the services from staffs. The location of the main building, restaurant, and reception was quite far to the rooms. And it had some stairs to downstairs, without any access for people with disabilities and if you had huge luggages. So, during check-out, I was carrying two big luggages, one tripod, and one camera bag. Along the way, I met some staffs, and surprisingly they're not offering me help to bring some of those luggages. I must brought them alone with my wife from room to the main building through stairs.There are several things you should consider if you want to stay in this hotel and resort. If you want to stay in quite remote area of Labuan Bajo with beautiful scenery, then this facility will be a good choice. BUT, only if you have arranged rented cars or motorcycle. Because you can not go anywhere else if you dont have those vehicles, unless you must allocate Rp. 120.000,- for each pick up from hotel.Other things that you should consider are the foods and wifi connection. They're not in good shape! And if you want to have them outside the hotel, then you must pay for the transportation from/to hotel."

The receptionist was very helpfull and friendly to give my twinnies free apple juice n candies.As this is not a big hotel, so everything looks like centered on reception desk. Like if you want to have laundry, need a beach towel, ask for first aid box, rent snorkeling gear, and book for the fast boat going to Rinca.On this desk, we can also borrow some book about Flores culture, maps, tourism attraction, for free.This hotel have private port, so we can go by boat directly to island from hotel.They provide free kayaks, that receptionist said we should enjoy the sunset on the sea.it was quite beach to han ve snorkeling, colorful corals and small fish.Breakfast was tempting, my twinnies love the mini sandwiches and pancakes, while parents consumpting delicious heavy meals.there's not many choices for breakfast everyday but all delicious, might be wonderful if they provide yoghurt.fitness centre also not have adequate tools but okay. billiard for IDR 10,000 is ok.swimming pool was clean and romantic in front of the beach. they provide kids pool, too.they need to build more facilities, bcs its isolated location.not all the staff can understand english well, but very simple english.actually they are really friendly, vibrant, and helpfull without language barrier.We extended our stay for two more night and the lady on the reception send us free fresh fruit every dinner since that.Restaurant staff is polite and looks fresh with blue uniforms. all the staff are caring our daughter and make us more comfy.Recommended hotel, Love to staying here!"

Just perfect choice to have your honeymoon or dating here.They also have speed boat for excursion, going to Rinca / Komodo Island. what i love is they give us plus 2-3 snorkeling spot after adventuring Komodo Island for free! the beautiful snorkeling place is pink beach and kanawa island. it's only half day trip, because we are going with super fast boat that only take us to Komodo Island within 1hour (you might have cheap boat in downtown that can reach Komodo Island more than 4hours).Here the lady on the reception give us complimentary wine and chocola te as we have long stay that's very pampering.

The quality isn’t fantastic and we only eat the necessary lots of flies during the day, they disappear at diner time. probably a side effect of being located next to a portLocation: not close to Labuan bajo’s centre by foot, you need to take a vehicle for about 15 minutes. we enjoyed not being in LB' s centre . The path after the main road ( currently in Oct 2014 ) isn't made of concrete. If you are ridding a motorbike, expect lots of dust. Check in and check out transport was included for us.There is a path of beach just in front were you can do decent snorkelling on a reef about 5/10 m long. Depending on the tide the visibility might decrease/ improve. Nothing spectacular as compare to the islands around Labuan bajo"
"Labuan Bajo","Sylvia Waicicu Beach Resort","3","JoFlo2010","Paris, France","Mix Feeling about this property","Overall was pleasant stay knowing that you are in Labuan Bajo we cannot expect to much.LOCATION:Great location despite take time to go there about 15mn to and from the Labuan Bajo itself, should not be really a problem if the road to go to the Hotel was fixed. Actually is a soil way with a lot of holes and this for 50% of the way to go there.Definitely you should rent a Motorbike to buy some freedom either to go around and visit this corner of Flores, either to go to have some meals and or having some drink. Without you are stock in the Hotel even if they provide some shuttle bus but each time is 50,000IDR... That they charge you and the end of your stay.Some of staff are great and really willing to helping you, the most friendly was Nico our driver, but is right that they barely speak english, so all communication was in Bahasa, good for me to practice as i live in Indonesia.Location itself is wonderful with a very nice beach, also they provide to you kayak for free if you are willing to adventure the see that you can snorkeling or willing to see the undersea nature.Otherwise the Hotel is a paradise for the staff, not doing to much and not really focused on guest service, feeling that they kill the time by chatting each others in a corner, or chatting on their mobile phone.THE ANNOYING PART:1) Was the first Hotel in my live to be charging the entire scheduled stay at Checking Time. A down payment or a deposit should be more than enough. For sure that they want you to stay with them and not changing Hotel during your labuan bajo Stay. It was low season and hotel was far to be full, i even didn't negotiate the price that they offer to me for two rooms. (suppose full price).2) One day something disappearing form one of the two rooms that we rent, nor electronic, nor camera, nor money, but monthly women stuffs. At the reception when i would like to know the name of the staff who clean the room, the Superior level go to see, as we cannot wait the result for this small thing; we receive a letter telling us that they have contacted the Police and up to our time to allow the Police to let them to go to the room for inventory. What a Joke, I imagine the police counting the number of softex and us to provide the proof!!!!! Anyway small thing....3) Breakfast was bellow average on what you can expect for this resort. Limited choice and poor quality. I like so much Indonesian food, but what they offer are not appetizing at all.4) We have a 1 time dinner (the arrival day) no body at the restaurant, waiting almost 1 hours to serve 3 dishes, 2 was the same dishes.. Taste was ok.5) Snooker table must be paid to play, however was the most game that the staff using to killing their night time whatever guest are around or not.6) Never book your Komodo trip with them, the price that they offer are insane to be in a boat with other peoples. I book directly in Labuan Bajo harbor for the entire day with good boat, lovely Captain and crew just for myself and family (3pers). This provide an excellent flexibility on what you want to see, where you want to go and at the time you wishes. The boat is for you. The crew asking me if can take with us 3 young guys from Komodo Island to bring them back to Labuan as their mother was Hospitalized. True or not, i don care, i just let them to come with us if can help those peoples visiting their mother or just to find a cheap way to join Labuan Bajo was my pleasure to help.7) CHECK OUT:Arriving to the front desk asking for my bill (dinner + Beverages consumption), i discover that they charge me 20,000IDR for a Room Key card who was damaged but in working condition. This is not a matter of amount to paid, i 'm not looking for 20,000IDR but more a matter of Hotelier gesture. Once again first time of my life that i need to pay for a room key cart. Arguing with the reception staff and manager, 2 ladies, they show me what the policy what i have read already upon C/I. However after our stollen tools in our room and without making any trouble to the management i was expecting not to be charged for this matter. Please ask a new Key card when you arrive as they have difficulties to understand the those Key card have a limited time live. If you are lucky enough, someone pay already for you previously, or you will pay for their next customer... What a bad thing to do. Probably i will never right this revue without the way how they threat us with this, their fake smile, their laugh of this.8) I want to pay with my credit card, wasn't able, receptionist told me that is because the connection and we are in Labuan Bajo. OK .... but to pay with the same credit card during the Check In, that was working properly and without any problem.Asking me to go with the driver to go to ATM to pay. Lucky me that i wasn't in rush to catch my plane.At the end, many small things happening to making us uncomfortable, feeling of lack interest by the staff, management.So you have other nice Hotel to deal with and assuming much more professional, much more Hotelier perception. (i'm working as hotelier myself, so i know perfectly how it's work)If you are lucky it can be a nice resort, otherwise to be avoided if you don't want your stay to be spoiled."

Usually a scooter would fix this problem but the last 2-3km back to the hotel goes through a dry and sandy dirt road which is really not the safest for riding on two wheels.

What's even worse, they only have one anti-mosquitoes spray for the whole hotel.The restaurant is not very nice, the food we tried was not a restaurant standard, it was more like what you would get in a small shop in any street. Not even the nasi goreng was good!The only good thing about this hotel it's the swimming pool and the views. But the worse worse thing is the staff and the service. Every time we asked for a pick-up, they understood wrong the time and place, and so they always picked us up late and we had to call to remind we were waiting for them.

Overall, our stay in Sylvia was good. Especially when we talk about location, the beach and the surrounding nature. My husband spent most of his time under water, snorkeling, and he was really happy with it. Our most concern about the hotel was the garbage along the beach and in the water, sometime it hangs on the coral :-( and unfortunately the hotel is not taking this issue seriously. Other issue was access to town, half of the road to town was really bad. However the rooms are clean and the staff are friendly but foods are not that satisfying in term of both the taste and serving time. Breakfast was also not quite ready for 4 starts hotel yet. But you have an option for a decent breakfast and dinner in the next hotel or in town with little bit hassle to reach. And time to time they have a problem with water supply. Water is transferred 6 to 7 times a day by truck from other part of the island. The hotel should have informed the guest about this and tell them to be wise in using the water because generally there is water supply issues in this part of Indonesia particularly during the dry season. Rooms are clustered into 2 in one roof which makes it less privacy, but we spent most of our time outdoor anyhow.

Ok, the hotel itself, as new and neat as it is, isn't actually all that swanky, the rooms are clean, comfortable but simple, the breakfast is plentiful and delicious if you like Indonesian/Chinese food (my girlfriend doesn't) and the restaurant food is average and over-priced, but ALL of this is more than made up for by the quite simply stunning location. Built at the top of an incline leading down to the sea, the open lobby and restaurant area looks down over an avenue of simple accommodation blocks leading directly onto the private white-sand beach and, beyond, a gorgeous bay of calm piercing blue water dotted with monkey-inhabited hilly islands. Highlights of staying here definitely include the sunset over the sea, exploring the little islands and their deserted beaches in the free-to-use kayaks and getting picked up at the hotel's own jetty by boats to take you exploring the Komodo National Park islands. I can't really emphasise just how beautiful this place is, it's still very untouched by commercial tourism, leaving you to enjoy the amazing views, pristine white sands and crystal clear waters and, best of all, the PEACE AND QUIET!! It does mean, however, that it is quite remote - it is accessed only via a mile-long unpaved road which makes for rather a bumpy ride. This is to be endured at least twice a day if you want to visit the bars and restaurants of Labuan Bajo (recommended), but at least the hotel puts on a shuttle service for a surcharge. Very friendly and helpful staff, nice little extras like being able to hire snorkelling equipment to explore the abundant coral reefs all about. Don't expect 5-star luxury, but if you want a little taste of unspoiled paradise at budget prices in a really interesting corner of the world, I can't recommend this place highly enough."

The resort itself looks nice, clean, good food, swimming pool and nice beach. Some good walks to the top of the mountain to enjoy sunset to the fullest. The bar/restaurant staff is lovely, however the staff from the reception is very rude, they dont want to help you when you want a taxi into town, they tell you it just broke when you saw it coming down 5 minutes before, long waiting times, and they will laugh and make jokes about you while you're waiting. I was fortunate enough to have an Indonesian friend with me who could point this out nicely. And when you are inside the town of LB you call the resort to pick you up again however the taxi shows up 1 hours later than planned or not at all, very inconvenient. Anyway when you like to get treated rude by the staff, definitely go here.Apart from the nice isolated location of the resort, I would not stay here in the future."

Friendly staff. That's the good part. Now for the rest: Very bumpy unmade road leads to the resort which does keep it quiet, but the hotel shuttle bus service is unreliable and not free ( a pick up charge for all journies is added to your final bill but not made clear at the time!) We arranged to be met at the airport and paid for this in advance but no-one came! We had to find a taxi which was prepared to make the trip (not many of them want to face the poor road so they charge a premium rate). Taxis are rare in Labuan Bajo so you are heavily reliant on the hotel shuttle. Very poor hygiene. The resturant is not cleaned regularly nor properly. Menus and tables are grubby and sticky - food is not cleared away. We saw a member of staff mop the floor then squeeze out the mop with her hands before slipping behind the counter to prepare food for a customer without washing her hands first! The water was cut off one morning for 3 hours - not the hotel's fault but there was no-one to deal with the situation nor explain. The hotel is poorly managed i.e. it is not managed at all! There is no resident manager and staff have not been trained. Fixtures and fittings are not fit for purpose. The tiles in our shower were cracked and had been ""filled in"" with tissues! The mirror was smashed but left on the wall above the wash basin. The sheets on our bed had not been changed and there was a rather unpleasant stain on the bottom sheet and greasy patches. Likewise towels are thin and grubby. I had a rather nasty brown stain on one of mine. We did not risk the swiming pool as we weren't sure if it was properly checked for disinfectant - we never saw anyone checking the water. This could be such a nice place if someone were to take it in hand, but right now it's a mess. We were chatting to a family who are Indonesian so could understand the staff and they said they flet that the place is in total chaos. Flores is a beautiful and fairly unspoilt island and well worth a visit. There are other hotels and I suggest you seek out one of these and leave the Sylvia alone."

Beach is normal clean. •you can take a cano for free, for snorkeling you must rent. One set is Rp 40k. •To visit Rinca or Komodo you better go down town or talk to one of the staff members (Rinca about Rp 1.000k for complete day including lunch for. 4 people). •about the restaurant: this area needs supervision. It's totally NOT manage however!! It's dirty tableware are not cleaned up after breakfast or lunch. It will stand on the table sometimes for more then one hour. That means a lot of flies. •Breakfast is good also in the choice you can make. When some items are empty or short it will take some time to supplementing it again. •Lunch and dinner are average noting special. •Bintang is mostly serviced to hot. Only the glass is cold. •We made our statement about the hygiene of the restaurant by the reception. We really hope the take good notice of it!!•Rooms are clean and big. Good water supply including safe, AC and TV. You can sit on the front of the room and enjoin the surrounding. •WIFI is only available in the restaurant and has limited excess of users. •The road to the resort is bad!! The government needs to do a major repair. However this is Indonesia and things work different than in The Netherlands. •The resort offers a drop off and pick up service to the town and airport. They drop you off at a point you requested in town. But for the drop off and pick up you have to pay!! The resort needs to do it for free or half the price. 50K for one room is to must. Even comparing with a taxi. •Drop off to the airport was on time. Pick up from the airport we waited for about 45 minutes. •We totally had no problems about the bill. This was very correct. •We didn't see no one of the MT. We are rating this resort with 2 dots, because of the very bad hygiene. We visit this resort with 4 people and rented 2 rooms. We stayed for 4 days and 3 nights. My name is Micheal Schoorl from The Netherlands. Traveling for 6 years in Indonesia. We wish the resort all the best to improve the hygiene."

But be warned ..... The service is terrable and English is not widely understood with the staff. The restaurant food including breakfast was very poor. When we came up for breakfast the area was dirty, food on the floor including dead geckos with ants everywhere not a nice start to the day. The road to the hotel is in a very poor state, dirt road and very bumpy. Be aware that although the pick up and drop off is a free service other trips into town they charge 100,000 IDR return. They don't tell you this at the time and there is no sign at reception with the cost. They just add it to your bill on check out which is not right!! There are hotels either side of Syvlia which do nice food, other than that you are stuck there.There was no manager on site to disscuss these issues and no other staff member was willing to contact this person if they even existed.

The nature (beach) is wonderful, only a bit littered (you find this all over Indonesia)But there is Roy (thank you Roy), the manager, who compensated us with a special price for the speed boat to Komodo and Rintja, and also took care of a rent-a-scooter. We are dynamic, so we didn't spend much time in the resort, but it was relaxing a whole day trips to have peace nad privacy. On whole, good value for the money."

The room was a garden room and it was lovely, clean and well maintained. The pool was clean and a nice temperature. The dining area has an amazing view although can get pretty hot. Wifi only works in the dining area/ Lobby. The service from the staff on a whole was great although there were hit and miss times when it came to language barriers, We never ventured back into town and decided to just chill at the hotel. We used the speed boats to go to Rinca and Komodo and it was amazing. They were very good at catering to my dietary requirements and nothing seemed like a hassle.

"Labuan Bajo","Sylvia Waicicu Beach Resort","3","Leah F","","Stunning view, poor service","On first glance, the hotel is magnificent; a private beach, clean rooms with a big bed and an infinity pool. However there are so many things that are missing. Firstly the road to the hotel is so terrible, the only method of transportation is the hotel cars. Unfortunately these stop at 10pm at night so you are left stranded in Labuan Bajo. Even with the promise of cars before 10, the hotel is very difficult to get through to and you could still be left in the centre with no way of getting home. There are insects and bugs throughout the hotel and the restaurant service is extremely poor. One morning we noticed a plate on the breakfast buffet that was crawling with ants. One of the staff came past noticed the plate and did nothing so we had to ask for it to be taken away. Hygiene is not a priority for the hotel. Overall we were very disappointed with the hotel and our stay as it has so much potential."

I got used to the bugs, but not the smell. Our shower had a wide crack in the tile, which someone had stuffed with kleenex! To keep what out? And the bathroom mirror was severely broken in an upper corner. The staff were absolutely lovely and kind, and helped us arrange a fast boat to see the komodo dragons.The dinner food is average, but inexpensive. Breakfast was actually quite good, with someone to prepare eggs however you want them. The only A/C will be in your room, and the dining area is open, unfortunately without any fans that might cool the place a little. But for about $60 per night, it's a good deal.

"Labuan Bajo","Sylvia Waicicu Beach Resort","3","funwarden1","Yuba City, California","New hotel with lots of potential","We just returned from our trip to Indonesia. We stayed at the Sylvia because our Dive Center parked their boat next door at the dock and was a short 5 min walk every morning. The Sylvia is a fairly new hotel. The staff was awesome. The value for your room was great. We stayed beachfront, which was beachfront with the beach and sea right in front of us. I used the beach and I was one of the few guest there so I felt like I had the beach all to myself. The serenity of this hotel was topnotch. You don't have the noise of town or other resorts. The downside of hotel. The road to get to the hotel is horrid. The road is a dirt road with more bumps and ditches from tires that it is truly awful to go down when you come from the airport or want to go to town. The hotel did supply a car to go to town but they charged you for the transport, I feel they should have given the transport complimentary. I felt our room was not completely finished. The drywall in the bathroom was not taped and textured yet. Poor planning on the design of the rooms. There is no electric outlets in the bathroom, so girls, no hairdryer, no curling iron in the bathroom and that is where the mirror is located. There is also no place to put the soap in the shower, a soap dish would be nice. Bring a clip on reading light because the lighting is not great to read at night. We have learned always to bring our clip on reading lights for our kindles. There is a safe, but it is not bolted down, so anyone could just walk off with the safe. We still used the safe and everything was safe. The food was good and very reasonably priced. Our complimentary breakfast was not served until 7 a.m. We requested 6 a.m. because we left for our dive boat at 6:30 a.m. and the staff was very accommodating for the buffet breakfast. The internet is not very good. We could get the internet sometimes in the dining room only, you have to be patient. There is a frig in the room and we used it to keep our water cold and put soft drinks in. Would I stay here again, probably, price was good and the food was decent. Only downside it is a way from town."

The only problems are that it is about 15 minutes from town (nothing around that you can walk to), so you are quite isolated and you have to eat there unless you hire a taxi to go to town (which usually costa 10$ return trip).

As it was the low season we pretty much had the resort to ourselves! The pool and beach were but a few feet from our room (priceless!). We had unlimited access to the kayaks to paddle around the beautiful bay and the pool tables were a pleasant amenity for our children.The rooms are basic but very functional: clean, quite (no mosque or roosters!) with hot water, TV's, and a safe.We ate at the restaurant many times and found the food decent for the price. There's other restaurants around the resort at adjacent hotels where we also dined. Wifi is only in the restaurant area and it comes and goes.Getting to and from the resort wasn't as bad as some of the reviews state. It's a 2km packed dirt road and the staff were happy to take us to town and back (50k rupiah each way). Ten minutes of bumps didn't seem too steep a price to pay for such a wonderful beach!Last but not least, the staff were absolutely wonderful and really made our stay so memorable! Without exception staff greeted us with smiles everyday and were prompt and professional throughout our stay! Although their hospitality training was limited their effort and enthusiasm made up for it. We truly felt at home, especially the last night when the staff allowed us to plug in our iPod and play our favourite reggae tunes!Only downside is the website. Tried to email them but never went through so try booking with Agoda. We had a great rate.New airport is almost finished and the high end resorts are beginning to pop up on this beautiful bay.

As mentioned in other reviews the road to the hotel is real a concern when it has rained heavily as it will in the rainy season. The hotel uses people carriers for guests at a cost but imo it's only a matter of time before it gets bogged down on the road.The hotel is still fairly new - 9 months or so and there is still debris from the construction process on the beach and parts of the grounds which needs removing. The place is pretty idyllic and very economical but sealing the road needs to be a priority. On the whole though well reccomended."
"Labuan Bajo","Sylvia Waicicu Beach Resort","3","cowryking","Giessen, Germany","A lot of potential","The hotel is situated in a lovely quiet bay north of the city, it takes 20 minutes to get there, via a terrible rough road. The beach is kept clean, snorkling is excellent, but there is garbage everywhere as you leave the premises. The building is brand new, but shows signs of bad engineering such as water stains on the ceilings. There is a very clean and beautiful pool and lounges (without covers) in the beach area. The rooms are in separate chalets. They are spacious, light and clean and equipped with a brand new fridge and AC. A water boiler is missing. The checkin and checkout procedures are professionally done, the staff is friendly and tries hard, but their training for attention to the guest and to what needs to be done to run a restaurant and a beach area has certain deficits. The restaurant overviews the bay and the chalets, yet it is the weak point of the resort. The food is below average even by indonesian standards, very basic things such as diet Coke and Soda water are not available. A good cook and an overhauled selection of food and drinks could turn this place into a little pearl on the Flores coast."

They told us there are only 2 out of 30 garden view rooms! Assuming, couple guests are not their target but friends or family! TV are good with sports and movies channels. Internet connection (wi-fi) is free of charge but available at the lobby area and restaurant only.

The hotel has its own boats for trips to Komodo. - we used this twice in our week's stay. A reasonable price and very quick compared to the boats from the town. The road to the hotel had not been finished but taxis from the airport and the hotel shuttle get through fine. The Sylvia is not in the centre of town but the shuttle will take you into town and pick you up at the end of an evening out. Just off the beach is a small area of live coral, great for snorkelling just off the beach.

A little far out of town, it is quiet and peaceful. However, it has many problems... Rooms are nice, big and modern, but the service is really bad. We stayed one night in an ocean view room and then were told we had to move to a garden view room because the hotel was full. We were told the only rooms available had twin beds... Well the hotel was definitely not full, in fact the room we vacated was empty that night, along with about 75% of the other rooms. I don't know why they told us that... On one night we waited nearly 2 hours for dinner, with no apology. When we moved rooms, we carried out bags to the new room, walking past ten staff members who were either sleeping or chasing each other with towels. The room service plates stayed outside our room for 2 days gathering ants. There was no banana boat and when I asked they said the boat driver was asleep. Most of the staff spent all day lying around on the beach or just gossiping... I brought up the problems and questioned the room change at check out and was met with blank looks and no apology or explanation. Sylvia hotel train your staff !

They sent us with no excuses to the Surya Hotel, 50m away - which is ok based on Labuan Bajo standards.. The second night we finally got our room at Chez Felix and slept bad due to a cockerel screaming non stop!!"

Basic but clean fan-cooled rooms, friendly, laid-back owners, quiet enough and 10 minutes' walk from Labuan Bajo town centre. There is a mosque not far away so you will hear the call to prayer at about 5am. This didn't bother me but if you're a light sleeper maybe bring earplugs. The roosters seem to wait until morning to start crowing, which was a relief. Restaurant is a great spot to sit morning or evening to enjoy the views of the harbour. Labuan Bajo is more expensive than other places in Indonesia so don't expect super cheap prices."

The owner, Hieronymous, and his family are lovely, trustworthy, helpfull and caring. I only locked the room here because I couldn't account for other travellers - I always left the key with Hieronymous. We were here for about 10 days while diving the area. We hired a bike from here too. All prices are good and there is no need to haggle. There is a great under cover eating area overlooking the sea and islands of Labun Bajo. Labuan Bajo is noisy and dirty - Chez Felix is just far enough out to be quiet and clean and still just a short walk into town."

Basic but clean fan cooled rooms with lovely garden outlook. The view from the restaurant is great - a great place to have a beer while watching the light change on the harbour and knowing you're away from the dust and noise of the main drag. We had good meals at the restaurant too. We ate down in the town too at street stalls and the night market - the 10 minute waddle up the hill helped settle the food :) Motorbikes for hire here too."

It is one of the cheapest stays in Labuan Bajo, so...Location: great! the hotel is located a bit above the city, so it is not so noisy and muggy as at the main street and from the resaturant there is a beautifull view on the sea. Rooms: very simple rooms - double bad, single bad, ventilator, bathroom with cold water. Not very well maintained, but clean! You can sit on the terrace outside - each room has a table and two chairs. There is also a nice garden!Finally, some words about the owner: a really nice and frinedly man! He speaks very good english and we had a lot of interesting conversations. The most important: he helped us a lot as we found out at the airport that our flight back to Bali was cancelled (stay away from Sky Aviation!) He was driving us from the airport to the travel agencies in the city and back, talking in our name to many people, trying to find a solution to our problem. Many thanks for that!!!"

The price was the same as for other places we had stayed in but the value was better. We loved the views and also appreciated the beautiful tropical garden. Service by Maria was friendly and helpful with regard to activities and transport to next destination and the free wifi was useful.

Staff are obviously in training from the owners of the business, so like other comments posted - you may need to ask for things more than once and to more than one person but this was not an issue for us.The first evening we arrived I was dumbstruck by the sunset view...a highlight of Lubuan Bajo and a reason to go round the head for a full on sunset at Paradise Bar.The rooms are pretty basic as what you expect in this part of SE Asia and the usual issue with bugs and no mossie nets but the rooms were pretty clean so had no complaints.Would stay there again if we were lucky enough to return...."

"Labuan Bajo","Chez Felix Hotel & Restaurant","0","Emoce","Prague, Czech Republic","Dissapointment","We stayed there for one night because we couldn't find a better place for reasonable price in Labuanbajo. The room didn't smell very good and look only OKish...there was no mosqito net and no running water during the night. We didn't get towels and were only given toilet paper when we asked for it twice. The staff (family) are nice enough. But the breakfast was only a greasy plain pancake.It is about 20 min walk downhill to the center (shops, restaurants etc.). There is nothing to see in Labuanbajo and the town is dusty and dirty, main road was just being repaired when were there. It only sevrves as a gateway to the nearby island which are worth visiting but I would recommend spending as little time here as possible.Altogether, Chez Felix is poor value for money. You can get miles better places to stay for half the price on other island."

It's also in a great location and the views are wonderful. However, we can't help feeling that the room are over-priced - the basic fan double should be no more than 200,000Rp even at peak. Bargain well and you could get them down to that level.thanksjames"
"Labuan Bajo","Chez Felix Hotel & Restaurant","0","Nicoleri","Switzerland","Nice place to stay","Chez Felix is a decent place to stay. There are fan and aircon rooms. The fan rooms are 200’000 and the aircon are 350’000. There is no big difference between the rooms, just the fan or the aircon and the rooms are a little bit bigger. There is a western toilet and a cold water shower. The rooms are clean and there is decent furniture. The staff is really friendly and they all speak really good English. With the above mentioned price is the breakfast included. You either can get toast, coffee or tea or banana pancake, coffee or tea. Chez Felix is not on the main street it’s up a hill and it’s really quite. Even if it’s more expensive than the average Hotel in Labuan Bajo it’s really worth to go to Chez Felix. The view from the restaurant is just amazing and the food is good and cheap"

The rooms were spacious, clean and had a decent fan. The owners were friendly and helpful and the food looked good (we didn't eat there but friends did). I've only rated it 3/5 for location as it was hit and miss. The guesthouse is at the top of the hill so has great views and is out of the dust and dirt of Labuan Bajo but is a 15 minute walk from the town centre where the majority of the restaurants/bars are.The town itself isn't anything special, it's a small port, dirty, dusty and has a fair few rats, but it's a good gateway to explore Flores and the surrounding islands. The towns and villages on Flores were amazing, we loved Kelimutu (Moni), Ruteng and Bajawa. we quite liked Ende too in a dirty, gritty way!!"

"Labuan Bajo","Chez Felix Hotel & Restaurant","0","SweetOtter","Wellington, New Zealand","Good, Clean and Budget","After deciding that the Gardena was a dump, we got a bemo up the hill to Chez Felix. It is harder to find, as it is not on the main drag, and does not have internet booking facilities.That said, I was VERY pleasantly surprised. We looked at several rooms before choosing one. They were priced between 100,000 to 150,000 rupiah (about $NZ18 to 25) and are good value for money. Breakfast was included in the price. While basic, they were clean and bright, with lots of windows. The bathrooms were a little ancient looking, but everything was CLEAN. It was also quiet.While there are no mosquito nets, these can be supplied if you ask. All the windows either close completely, or have proper screens on them, in good repair. Normally, you would spray your room with insect killer just before going out for dinner, so it is clear when you settle down for the night. There were good fans, which helped cool the place down, as Flores can be quite hot. The food in the restaurant, while fairly basic, was nice and also inexpensive. Breakfast was coffee/tea, pancake, toast or fried egg with toast. They had the best Mie Goreng I had on my trip.The place is run by an extended family who all speak English, and are relaxed and friendly. My son played with their children and they invited him into their house to watch cartoons on their TV. They also didn't have a safety box, but my valuables were kept under lock and key in their own house. I felt this was a very safe place. I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Labuan Bajo. It is a short walk down the hill, and if it's too hot to walk up again, just get a bemo for 3000 rupiah! ($NZ 0.50cents)"

I stayed for 4 nights only but it was visibly under very poor management. The receptionist was helpful but housekeeping department was very bad. My room was never cleaned until I asked on the third night, yet the linen was promised on the following morning but never happened until on the fourth night when i asked them to clean and to change the linen. The bathroom was dirty, the hot shower was not hot, neither warm, and the air condition was not cool either. The room which they called deluxe was only spacious room with TV. Toiletries was only soap.With such price, the hotel did no offer such good service. the promised wifi did not reach the room. It was a disappointing. Be prepare for inconveniences."

There were no disturbances at night and the bed was comfortable, with crisp linen. The reception was helpful and eager to help without delay. The room rate was fair. There was a grocery store right next door.However, the airport shuttle, confirmed by the manager, was not there. More importantly, the car rental reserved through him was very disappointing. Had to hire a driver, even though there is no real need for drivers in easy to drive Flores. The driver was reckless (cutting blind corners etc., near accidents), caused delays, swindled money (his bills were added to mine) and hated tourists. All in all, the rental cost me 20% more than was agreed in our deal, and the driver's behavior spoiled my visit in Flores.There is no restaurant in the hotel."

At first, we booked a room at 200,000 rp a night, but because we were 2 friends in the same room, we asked for 2 simple beds, for this price, and they told us there was no problem. But surprise, when we arrived exhausted after a day of diving, they told us that our room was in fact 350,000 rp, and that there were no more room at 200,000 rp available. Because we were tired, we decided to take it anyway. But in the morning, we had the pleasure (not) to discover hundreds of ants in our bags that were on the counter next to the window. When we tried to explain this to the management, they wouldn't hear us and maintained that we probably brought those ants for somewhere else (that was not true cause they were not in our bag the night before). So we cancelled our second night and found another place to go. And the breakfast: one of the cheapest i've seen around Indonesia. Cheap price; cheap hotel. You can do better."

It was not bad, though it is not as good as claimed. I did find that if you booked ahead, you were charged a premium rate, where if you booked from them while you were there, the price was more reasonable. It was clean, had good air con. and a nice bed, so if you are just going through its not bad if you can get them to come down on the price. I did think all the hotels in the area where trying to keep up with Bali prices instead of looking at what they had and where they were and then pricing rooms. The bad point about the room, is the lack of wifi, unless you sat downstairs in the lobby, and no food was anywhere around the hotel. If you don't mind about a 10 minute walk, there was a nice little café. Walking in the rain and trying to keep to companies pick up times makes it so much harder."

Even though there were three or more people at the counter. We had ordered a twin bedroom but got a double. Being brothers who have tried sleeping in worse places, we were fine with sharing for one night.Our tour was delayed for one day, so I asked to stay one more night. I asked for a twin bedroom, which they said were all booked. They told me that they only have 3 of those!! WiFi is very bad. Internet connection didn't work most of the time, even if the hot-spot was available (heard a few guests complaining about this too). This isn't a problem for us, as it might be related to the remoteness of the island...Few channels on the tiny TV. Good location though. Placed in the middle between the airport and the port.Bathroom was way too dark. A lot of ants in the room. Bad sound isolation. After our 2 days, we checked out. Took forever again. Though I could see on their screen that it said that I had already payed (when booking) they kept asking if I had payed. I had to sign a thing making me liable for any damages (guess they didn't have anyone to check the room in the half hour it took to check out. Makes sense when half the staff is behind the counter) Good thing is we could leave our luggage there while we were on tour. It is next to the counter and not safe at all. Didn't matter because all we left was clothes.Now that we were leaving our things here, we thought it was appropriate to stay here on our last night. We asked if we could reserve for the 9th, but the guy said they were fully booked and offered some other random date. What.We went outside and ordered a room using our mobile data.2 days later we return after over 30km of trekking. Everything still the same.This time we get THE DIRTIEST HOTEL ROOM I'VE EVER GOTTEN. The toilet looked like it had been used for a month. Sink was covered in mud, trash was full and used toiletries all over. Next morning we left and for the first time agreed that the hotel deserved a bad review."

They gave away a room (the one for 155k) that I booked in person talking with 3 different receptionists. As I explained to all of them, I was going on a boat/camping trip, coming back 3 days after at 8pm and didn't want to risk not having a bed and a shower afterwards! I quite rightly triple checked until I saw one of them putting my reservation in the computer (the other 2 receptionists only told me not to worry!) but clearly it wasn't enough. When I got back from the trip the room wasn't available. Instead of admitting the mistake, 5 equally incompetent receptionists wasted one hour of my time and offered me a room for 300k, which I didn't accept. They made several phone calls to a ""manager"" who is a bad fit for his role. He told me in very poor English (who knows who writes for him the replies he dares posting on tripadvisor) that my reservation wasn't guaranteed (???). I stopped arguing and left the hotel when he attempted offering me airport transfer, which I took as an insult as it's very easy to arrange a motorbike on the street for 5k.I wish I had stolen some pillow cases! :)"

"Labuan Bajo","L Bajo Hotel","3","CathrinausDO","Dortmund, Germany","No hot water as promised, incredibly disorganised","The rooms are pretty new, so they are in quite good shape. The problem is all about the staff:1. As we had asked for a room with hot water (300IDR) and not cold water (150IDR), we had hoped for a nice warm shower, but nothing. We told the staff and ended up with four people holding their hands under the shower, but it didn't help. An engineer was promised to have a look in the morning, nothing. We were given a new room twice (!) - no hot water. We stayed for 6 nights anyway (the last two nights with hot water!) - we were tired of moving at that point and didn't have much time after the dive trips.2. You need A LOT of time and patience when checking out, which is why I wanted to do so the night before leaving. They had no clue about the number of nights we had stayed there, but being honest, I wanted to pay. Big mistake! It took me more than 25 minutes TWICE (evening and next morning) to get that settled.So basically a nice hotel with staff that is simply disinterested and doesn't care."

Well, while the room was rather spartan, it covers anything that you need. The hotel is in favorable good location if you prefer a hotel where you can get a deep rest. But it's a bit far from the ""city crowd"", especially if you want to enjoy the night life of Labuan Bajo :D Well, it's not that far, really. But Labuan Bajo's street at night could get pretty dark (It's better if you just ride ojek if you're going out late at night). Anyway, there's also a convenience store next to this hotel.

Facilities listed as available - breakfast, restaurant etc - are non-existent. To make matters worse, three weeks after I checked out, and paid bill in full (as you do), a further charge of AUS$37 has gone through my credit card account.

He kept asking me over and over about the pillow cases. I told him, listen, regardless of how the pillow cases got in the room, I don't want your pillow cases, I don't steal pillow cases. Why would I want your pillow cases? Stop talking about the pillow cases. Let's talk about the more pertinent issues: the hot water not working AT ALL, the internet not working, etc. I said you have a paying guest bringing up real issues about your hotel and your accusing me of stealing pillow cases?He was oblivious to fix theses problems and continued asking me about the pillow cases that were sitting in the room. After he made ZERO effort to fix the water or internet issues and still kept talking about the pillow cases, I had to walk away. It was almost comical. Terrible experience.

Especially at end of day after getting back from diving. The manager also accused my friend of stealing pillow cases that the staff had left in the room. Who steals pillow cases ??? Work on your internet and hot water that customers are paying for before making accusations over something so silly. Also some issues with construction"
"Labuan Bajo","L Bajo Hotel","3","cpower88","Hong Kong Region, China","""Good Base Hotel for Labuan Bajo""","We travelled from Hong Kong. After spending a night in Bali, we headed to Labuan Bajo. We booked 3 nights with the hotel. Our intention is to go diving, snorkeling & Komodo Island hopping. We didn't expect much for the hotel as we are very accommodating visitors especially if one is travelling to outlaying township in a far away places...L Bojo hotel turned out great. We are from the hospitality industry and it was nice to see our room as spotless, the linens clean, and the bath room acceptable, and shower working reasonably well; which are most important to those who understand the needs of a relaxing & clean room upon your return from diving & swimming in the sea the whole day. The pressure to the hot shower can still be improvised. They do not provide any amenities so do bring your own toilettes such as shampoo, toothbrushes, slippers. No hot water kettle is provided. But there's not a desperate need for it.If you need hot water , coffee or tea we can drop by the lobby floor where they provided complementary hot beverages. If you are hungry at night, they do sale instant noodle!While we are there, the hotel was undergoing a lift fitting. Thus, the renovation of the lift shaft can be messy.We can get access to free wifi in our room located on the 3/F. Access wifi to APP seem to be smooth but it would be slow to connect to corporate server. We usually proceed to the Lobby to access wifi connect to our corporate server & reply necessary email if required.The next best is the GURUDA airline customer office in L Bajo which is situated on the hotel 1/F. As we need to adjust our ticketing services, we found the office closing hours till 8pm wonderful.There is a mini supermarket next to the lobby floor (same building) which you can pick up some snack & drinks if you wish.As for the transportation to the (L Bajo Harbor, diving centre) or generally the ""main street of Labuan Bajo"", it is a easy walk down from the hotel. It takes about 10-15 mins and you will have covered most of the restaurant in town.If you feel lazy after your dinner and prefer not to walk uphill back to the hotel, simply take the ""local motorbike taxi"" or """"mini bus taxi"" for RP5,000 per person each way. Before hopping in, just tell them the name of the hotel.On the departure day, we took a walk up to the roof top of the hotel to take some scenic photographs. Wow, the view from the corner room on the highest floor have the best view and I am sure it will be fully booked after the renovation or construction is fully completed. Right now, they are still in the progress of touching up. I am sure the price of the hotel room will moved up as well. The hotel is also quite popular with the local businessmen & Indonesian tourists.Overall, as said, ""It was a good base hotel for us"""
"Labuan Bajo","L Bajo Hotel","3","Salem E","","Super clean, Nice place","Booked a room online for my wife and I after our komodo trip. Turned out great. Room was spotless, linens clean, great bathroom, plenty of space. Not much in the way of decor, but they are still completing the hotel so maybe they will add some decorations before they're done. Also there was some confusion because we thought we had paid online, then they asked for payment again when we checked out. After checking our credit card bill turns out they hadn't charged us yet so all was all. Probably just growing pains. It is a little distance to the harbor and all the restaurants and bars, but we just hopped on a motorcycle with some local and 5 minutes and 10,000 rupiah later you are there. Wi-Fi a little slow and didn't work on 4th floor.Overall, we had a great one night stay. Perfect if you're coming or going from Labuan Bajo as most folks are."
"Labuan Bajo","L Bajo Hotel","3","Ritzrox","Winnipeg, Canada","Last minute stay","All in all, I was happy with our stay at L Bajo. We wouldn't have picked it if we had booked farther in advance, but most everything was already sold out. Our first night in Labuan Bajo we stayed above a smoky dive shop, and had no sleep, so we were so thankful L Bajo had room for us. ProsComfortable beds and pillowsClean roomair conditioningeasy arrangement for driver to airport (50,000 IDR)friendly staff, helped us with our luggage up all the flights of stairs.10 min walk from main strip of dive shops and harborConsDidn't give us clean towels throughout our stayOne night we came back and noticed the toilet paper roll that had been full that morning was now empty, and they left us without toilet paper (weird)Wifi was terrible. Not available at all in the room, and still very poor in lobbyNo elevator (although it looks like they are building one) we stayed on the 5th floor."
"Labuan Bajo","L Bajo Hotel","3","Dumas85","Fort McMurray, Canada","Great hotel for Labuan Bajo","This hotel is clean and new. It has excellent working facilities. However hot water is hit and miss. The water pressure to the shower is excellent though. My only complaint is they need to have wifi in the rooms. For now you have to go down in the main floor to use it. Price is reasonable for what you get as well. The staff are very friendly as well. It would also be nice if they had more english channels besides just one."
"Labuan Bajo","L Bajo Hotel","3","08HeatherR","Steamboat Springs, Colorado","I'd give it a 3.5...","So in all reality this is a great hotel for Labuan Bajo. The room was very clean, we slept well, the a/c worked great and it is a good location just above the main over crowded street below that offers dive shops and a few restaurants. My big complaint however would be they let people smoke EVERYWHERE...In the lobby, in the rooms, in the halls, out front...there is no where to go to escape disgusting smokers. The entire hotel, while still relatively new, smelled like an ashtray to us. Prepare yourself as ALL of Flores seems to be like this, all the men in Flores smoke and most of the tourists seem to be European and no gives a care if you are enjoying a meal or trying to relax near them they will ALL light up. It's gross. The other complaint would be that we had no hot water. We stayed 2 different nights, one before our boat trip and one after and both rooms reeked of cigs and had no hot water in the shower. This is probably your best option in town for a hotel but take note it will only get worse as they allow more smokers to pollute their new ""clean"" hotel. Wifi was decent but often very slow."

I didn't love the bathroom, I found the shower to just be okay as there isn't a proper door and with my long hair water went everywhere. The faucet wasn't caulked and tended to wiggle. With that being said there was hot water and water pressure. I would certainly stay here again!"
"Labuan Bajo","L Bajo Hotel","3","Azrael84","UK","New hotel but great","The hotel has a good location within a short walk on the main strip of Lubuan Bajo (there is also a shop, Bali Mart right next door). The rooms are clean, modern and quiet with a good view over the bay. The hotel is new and some things aren't yet finished, e.g. lifts, and the WiFi, at least the 3rd floor is rather slow. The staff here are very friendly and they really went out of their way to help us. I would definitely stay here again if in town."
"Labuan Bajo","L Bajo Hotel","3","emma e","brooklyn","Wouldn't stay anywhere else! Mold-free, quiet, SO CLEAN!","We wandered all over town looking at moldy, dark rooms at ridiculous rates. It seems a lot of accommodations here are riding the Lonely Planet train - failing to maintain cleanliness standards and still raising prices. Thank goodness for this gem! Hotel is BRAND NEW - not even finished. By summertime expect this place to be busy. We are the only guests on our floor. Room is BIG! BRIGHT! CLEAN! Hot hot hot showers! Bed is comfortable, pillows fluffy. Sheets and towels are cleanest I've seen my whole trip. Big windows overlook hills. Room is quiet, and has efficient air conditioner. There is a small tv, only Indonesian channels. Only complaints - would be nice to have a brighter lightbulb in the bathroom, and the wifi doesn't yet reach the fourth floor. I'm sure that the wifi will reach once construction is finished, but don't mind using it in the clean lobby. Elevator is being built now, too. Complementary tea and coffee in the mornings, breakfast not included. Convenient Bali Deli in the building for affordable water, beer, snacks - also has large selection of toiletries, etc. For 300,000 a night, this is a steal. Seriously- why would you pay the same or more for a dark, moldy room? I imagine it will be hard to get a room here during peak season. Book now!"
