","Great place to snorkel and dive ","We just had a great week in family at Komodo resort. Perfectly located in Flores best spot for diving and snorkelling, with beautiful islands surrounding. Crew are competent and the boats are very comfortable with upper deck equipped with fat boy type seats.The resort chalets are simple yet comfortable with big room and bathroom. Equipped with performing air con, hot water, mini bar, and fast speed internet.Even better is the food, excellent compared to usual Indonesian standards. Indonesian tasty food for lunch with Italian style dinner. Good choice of cocktail and vines at very affordable prices. A great place to stay and to enjoy the amazing underwater."

","Paradise above and below the water!","My wife and I stayed at Komodo in April 2014 and we can not say enough great things about the place. The initial conversations I had with the dive shop and resort staff was easy and made you feel confident you had made the right choice. As the boat pulls up to the dock and you take your first real look at your tiny little island getaway we knew we had made the right choice for our week holiday.The accommodations are perfect and how can you beat the view every morning. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom was excellent, and again the view from the patio doesn't get much better for relaxing after a wonderful dive or gazing at the stars at night. The food..... what more can you say about that except absolutely wonderful! I am not a dessert person but the chocolate mouse they made... wow! Everything just ran smoothly in the restaurant. Wake up, have breakfast before your dive, place your lunch and dinner menu and prepare to have your taste bud blown away by the quality of the food. Great job to everyone who makes/prepares the food. Saved the best for last.... the scuba diving! The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. I enjoyed the many conversations we had in between dives. They spoil you - not only with the dive sites but when you show up at the resort you put your gear in a box and let them know the day before if you will be diving. All you have to do is walk onto the boat and they have you covered. The boat is very comfortable and the lunches were good as well. When you arrive you are required to do a check dive (which is normal) on their house reef. The house reef was a pretty nice dive, after diving that I knew we were in for a treat when we started to go to the other dive locations. I would recommend doing the night dive on the house reef as well. Our favorite dives were Castle Rock and Batu Bolong they were right out of the pages of National Geographic! Truly an amazing place to be, you know when your dive guides are truly excited and pumped after a dive, you just experienced something very special. From the sharks to the schools of fusiliers, to the schools of fish (too many to mention) it was unbelievable. Even writing this it brings back a smile to my face. We have dived in many places around the world and your dive shop definitely ranks up to the top ones we have been fortunate enough to dive with.Day trip - we did the day trip out to Komodo Island and it was worth it. Seeing the Komodo dragon in the wild was a great experience, even though the majority of dragons you see (when we were there) are by the kitchen and the living quarters. The hikes are easy as you do not gain much in elevation, being avid hikers we thought the pace was fairly slow but I guess it isn't bad too slow down on holidays. On the way back we snorkeled at one spot with 3 large Manta Rays for probably 30 minutes. Amazing experience! We had the opportunity to dive at Manta point as well which was good, but the snorkeling experience was much better as their was fewer people.Thank you Komodo Resort for a great experience, we will be coming back one day!"

","Great resort when you want to get away from it all","My husband and I stayed here the first week of January and even though the resort was closing down for the season two weeks later, they took fabulous care of us! We did a week of diving and were not disappointed with the corals and the critters we saw (even though the water was COLD!) The stand alone cabañas are lovely, nicely decorated with beautiful four poster beds and a comfy mattress. The bathroom was not air conditioned and since we were there during the hottest season, it got a little warm in there. But oh my, the food! Lunches are Indonesian fare - delicious and satisfying. We had traveled to Indonesia before and had left not thinking too much of local cuisine, but the lunches at Komodo have opened our eyes to the possibilities of Indonesian cuisine. And then there was dinner. By far this was some of the best Italian food I have eaten anywhere in years! This level of cuisine would be high in a big city, but the fact that you are in a small, deserted island in the middle of where the Indian and Pacific ocean meet - it's amazing! There are four course per dinner, a salad, pasta course, main course and dessert. And you should pace yourself, but don't skip dessert! The staff was incredibly warm and friendly. The dive staff was knowledgable and obviously enjoyed their jobs. All in all, it was a fantastic week!"

","Easily the best placed I have ever stayed","Komodo Dive Resort is lucky enough to be in one of the most beautiful spots in the world - above ground and underwater. The diving is simply unreal. The snorkelling (which you can do right off the beach) is extraordinary. The three meals a day you receive are magnificent. The staff are friendly, helpful and always keen to chat.We stayed for 4 nights (wish it was longer), dived for three for $250 a day per person - which is very reasonably priced for what you get. Will definitely be going back in 2016/2017."

","Flawlessly run paradise island","My husband's family and my family stayed at Komodo Resort for 4 nights through to NYE 2016, and had a fantastic time! It is not easy to find a resort that could please 12 very different people (my husband's family hails from Sweden while mine from Indonesia; 6 of us were divers while the rest snorkel; age range between 22 and 75), yet Komodo Resort was met with enthusiastic approvals from everyone in the group. Reservations were very smooth and problem free. Arrivals were so smooth - we were on the boat headed to Sebayur within 30 mins of getting off our plane. Then we got to meet Elena - really, the core of everything we love about Komodo. She puts guests above everything else, and not a detail is overlooked - from fruits when we arrived, to a homemade birthday cake for my dad's birthday, to boxed lunches for Komodo dragon trips. At one point my sister broke her flip flops (a necessity on the island!) and she even sorted out a new pair from Labuan Bajo on the same day - incredible! Both divers and snorkelers were very warmly accommodated. On the first day, they fit you out with all the gear you need, and if time allows, get you to do a check-out dive, which I appreciate. The dives were of course incredible (if you're a diver and you haven't been to Komodo Islands, go NOW), but the divemaster and boat staff went on great lengths to ensure that not only would all our needs be met, but also that all our the snorkelers of the group had a great time as well, by giving them specific briefings and providing speed boats. The one thing we did not (and still do not, to this day) understand is the fact that they ask you to put together your dive equipment. My husband and I have dived all over the world (Grand Cayman, Cuba, Aruba, Mexico, Palau, Sipadan, Bali, etc. - even Komodo the previous year as well), but this was literally the first full service/non-budget operator we've ever had that asked us to put together our dive equipment. It is not a big deal in and of itself as the remainder of the service was impeccable (e.g., they put the equipment on the boat for you and rinse them afterwards), but we are confounded as to why such a resort that otherwise provide 5-star service would not put together divers' equipment. When asked, their argument was safety, which was not a valid argument in our views, given all the other dive shops we've ever been with also put utmost focus on safety and could still put together equipment - this includes the dive shop in Labuan Bajo we went with the previous year. Further, our equipment was rented from the resort, so therefore Komodo logically would be best placed to put them together and take them apart - both from the equipment maintenance perspective as well as safety. All in all, not a huge deal, but we are so confounded by this, especially in contrast to the flawless service and operations that the resort otherwise provides, that we thought it is worth pointing out. Divemasters Luca and Sam were a joy to dive with, thank you! Given the resort's location, we would be back every day around lunch time after 2 incredible dives, so the days are as good as you could ever wish them to be. The rooms themselves were very comfortably appointed. I would not put them in the truly luxurious category, but they are definitely nice, clean, and lovely - they had aircons, a spacious bathroom, and even a pail of water to wash your feet/flip flop so your bungalows don't get too soiled by sand/soil. The bug nets they put around the bed every evening were very useful, as well. We did find walking back to the bungalows a bit of a challenge when it rained, as the soil became muddy; this is definitely something we feel strongly that the management can very easily remedy by installing gravel/walkways leading up to the bungalows. Also, there were a few bugs and gecko poo to be found in the bathrooms every now and then; not a major issue however and really nothing that can be done about it. Food was probably one of the topmost highlights of our stay. Indonesian food for lunch and Italian food for dinner provided for ample variety, and the quality of the food was top notch - we were quite the group of foodies, and we were very impressed. From Indonesian fried rice to spaghetti alla puttanesca, everything is very authentic and incredibly tasty. Bravo to the chefs and kitchen staff. One tip - definitely check out the house reef early. Even snorkeling, it is one of the most beautiful and lush reefs I've ever seen! We unfortunately checked it out too late on our last day, as we otherwise would have liked to do a shore dive given how pretty it was. All in all - bravo for such a flawlessly run paradise island - and thank you again to Elena who makes the island tick!"

","In The Heart Of The Dragon","I stayed and dived a week at this amazing hotel. The diving was superb. My special thanks go to Leo, and the rest of the Dive crew for taking me to the fabulous dive sites.The bungalows were super comfortable and charming. The food was fabulous even for the vegan that I was. There was always somethings delicious to eat.The staff is extremely friendly, and the tours to Komodo Island were well organized. One of the islands facing the resort, actually looks like a sleeping dragon. I am still dreaming about some of the dive sites I dove at, and will certainly visit the island again."

","Very pleasant stay at the Komodo Resort","We stayed at the Komodo Resort last week. In the beginning we didn't expect to see much but Komodo turned out to be paradise for snorkeling and diving. Although I heard the waters in Raja Ampat are more transparent, we saw mantas swimming just 2-meter below us, some shark, and sea turtles. The corals in Batu Bolong are nice too although current can be a bit strong for those non-swimmers. The resort itself is professionally run, thanks to the Italian owner and manager, Elena, who took care of us really well. For a resort in the middle of nowhere, the Italian food is great especially the basil/pesto sauce pasta and thin crust pizza. As Indonesians, we would prefer more selection of grilled fish, crabs, and prawns/lobsters served in local Indonesian style but I was told there is some restriction on fishing around the island although we saw some delicious-looking fish swimming below the pier. Other than snorkeling and patting komodos, we enjoyed the tranquil night atmosphere while chatting with the other guests. Wish I could stay for a few nights longer since we did not get to explore some of the the other scenic spots like pink beach. Some people mentioned the rate is a bit high. Considering the high cost of transporting water, fuel to the island, quality of service and other stuff (70+ well-trained employees), I can understand. I hope they can keep up the good work and care to the sea environment lacking in Indonesia."

","Unforgettable holidays","We thought 3 nights to stay was enough, but we was wrong. The breathtaking scenery, professional staffs and their hospitality makes us hard to leave. Thank you for the owner and Helena who understand us about our 8 hours delay flight from Denpasar to Labuan Bajo, finally we made it in the evening but too bad we have to skip the Pink beach. We really enjoy playing with the shells in the seashore or snorkelling just in front of our balcony room. Helena makes everything comfortable during our stay, from visiting the komodo dragon in Rinca island, swimming with manta rays, snorkelling and trekking. The food was delicious, however the portion was a little bit too big for Indonesian people like us. The price in this resort was affordable, especially if you compare to depart from Labuan Bajo. Staying in this resort will save your time to reach the highlights destination. The most important thing is they make us feels so comfortable, as the staffs will assist you everywhere, as our diving instructor assist 2 seniors in our group to seeing mantas in the sea. The night view above the sky was amazing, the stars are bright and there is 4 milky ways during my first night. Make sure to bring flashlight with enough battery, mosquito repellent, sunblocks, very light clothes, simpati telephone sim card (others are not working) during your stay. We wish to come again ♡"

","3 weeks in paradise","No cars, no barking dogs, no karaoke bars, no crying children (mostly) :), diving 2 or 3 times /day in one of 10 top diving spots in the world, snorkeling on pristine coral reef couple of miles long which starts in front of your accommodation, spotlessly clean accommodation (take AC or you die), fantastic food and very very friendly waiting staff. Italian food is the best we have every tasted anywhere in the world including Trastevere area in Rome.Dive instructor Luka put so much effort in making us better divers (28 dives). We finally graduated from shrimps to sardines :). Leo and Sam diving instructor and dive master were very friendly, helpful and professional. The best diving one can imagine. Mantas galore, turtles, variety of fish, unspoilt coral. Fantastically well organized and executed resort and its activities. Ellena the resident manageress took care of every requirement with a smile.Hats off to Antonello (co-owner), management team and the team of workers at the resort. They created a paradise. To get back to 'reality' you just go to Labuan Bajo and see the difference. We will be back for another 3 weeks within a year or two.Excellent Wi-Fi in your room !!! - free of charge. No TV !!!!The best sleep we had for some years !!Thanks a million for the best chill out vacations we ever had. Mario"

","Go only for the Diving (and snorkeling)","I was really excited to stay at this resort after reading all the fabulous reviews but, as the owners themselves say, it is only a 3*. Perhaps to those who regularly stay at dive resorts this feels a little more upscale but we like to stay in more upscale resorts and then also dive so the expectations were higher regarding the resort itself.The diving here is fantastic and the snorkelling is actually also really incredible - while snorkelling I saw a reef shark, mantas, incredible coral and probably the most diverse ecosystem I've ever seen. No arguing that this is an amazing place to dive and while we were there for 5 days there were people that were there for 2 weeks, doing 3-4 dives per day and not diving the same location twice. Fantastic experience.If you don't dive though, or actively go out in the boats daily to snorkel, there is really nothing else to do. The beach is not really a swimming beach, except to go out snorkelling in the house reef but not a beautiful beach to go in and out of the water and sit at all day (unless you are super immersed in a book and don't really care about your surroundings).The breakfasts are basic, the lunches are fine and the dinners are good and very plentiful but not spectacular. Loved the cheese table that was there one night but would have loved more choice in desserts - same choice of desserts for the entire stay for all lunches and dinners. As for the rooms, I have to say that we slept very well. Of course you're exhausted after being out in the water all day. I have no issues with no tv but would have loved better connection to wifi in the room like there was in the main areas. We brought an extra carafe of water to the room every night from dinner since the water there was not enough and no phone to call for more (and it is super dark at night to go get more). I think my biggest issues were with the linens. The sheets, although I'm sure clean, had little holes or stains on them which was a real ick factor and the white towels were kind of greyish blue and looked like they had been washed a million times with the purple beach towels. I think this linen factor is really what kept me from making this a 4* experience vs a 3* - this could easily be a very boutiquey kind of dive resorts if the attention to these kinds of things is kept. I do understand though that they have to send the laundry away so maybe don't have total control.Overall, this is probably a great alternative to a liveaboard but for those of us who like diving as an activity, rather then being the whole vacation, 3 days probably would have been good. Personally we wouldn't go back since there are lots of great places to visit and dive around the world but I am very glad we did dive and snorkel here - it was very memorable!"

","A great way to dive Komodo","A wonderful resort that provides [relatively] short / easy access to all the main Komodo dive sites. Bookings, airport transfers and similar ""logistics"" all managed smoothly and efficiently by email and / or telephone.Accommodation is very comfortable, in bungalows that are comfortable and have been thoughtfully positioned to ensure guests' privacy. The food is amazing, tasty and plentiful. Indonesian for lunch and Italian for dinner; if anything, there is probably too much of it. In general, the staff are friendly and willing, nothing is too much trouble.Diving from large boats is carefully planned and executed, with safety and enjoyment in mind. The first resort in many years of diving in Indonesia that insisted on a test dive on arrival...good on them! Guides are European instructors with a wealth knowledge and experience. Only one local DMT so far, but I suspect that the good folk at Komodo will soon be qualifying more locals. One is expected to prep one's own equipment pre-dive[I always prefer to do it anyway] but the boat crew are on hand to assist those who have forgotten. Unfortunately it may not be possible to dive all the well-known Komodo sites in a week, so plan for a long stay.Snorkelling on the resort jetty is great with lots to see. Currents can be strong, so be aware and check with the staff if in doubt.It is not a cheap resort, don't expect a budget holiday. There are ""cheap and cheerful"" options if price is your only criteria, however for a wonderful experience I can heartily recommend this resort.Congrats Luca, Elena and all the other staff members who make it a pleasure for all the guests, in and out of the water"

","peace and quiet in a laid back ambience","UPs:+ beautiful setting+ spacious, gorgeous bungalows+ private island within the National Park+ amazing ""house-reef"" for snorkeling, easy access of the house pier+ very friendly and competent staff+ great variety for breakfast dishes, a little bit of everything+ lunch and dinner offers tasty food- however nothing to special or fancy- i really expected a bit more+ spa is situated on the beach- enjoyed my massage, but there aren't any candels lit nor can you smell oils, so it doesn't have that typical relaxing spa feelDOWNs:- first thing, we had to wait for 1 hour and got charged at the office in LBJ with a marine fee 150 000 Rp and 25 000 Rp for diving- before we even arrived at the resort! For the price you pay per night- that fee should be included or paid at the booking time and guests should not be hassled before they even set foot on a boat or the island itself! - not a welcoming start to the whole journey (on top of that- we never went on a diveboat, as we were only snorkeling in the house reef)- secondly, we got picked up from LBJ on a supply boat! we personally did not mind, however it is not very professional having guests sitting in between pumpkins and eggs without a Front of house staff to assist with any queries- guests should be given large bottles of complimentary water- since juices, tea, coffee is not included in the price anywaysALL in ALL:Komodo Resort and Diving Club is a great getaway if you would like some peace and quiet in a laid back atmosphere. Snorkelers are left to their own devices and can easily spend hours in the house reef, whilst divers are taken care of by the owners themselves.All in all a great resort!"

","Sun, sea, sand","We had spent a week aboard the Moana dive boat and came back to the island for 6 days relaxation although my husband continued to dive. The staff were very young training students but pleasant and food acceptable. Although the beach accommodation was clean and spacious this resort is not a luxury resort as it is mainly based around diving. I think it could be improved to accommodate non divers. The spa was a very basic room on the beach and not at all relaxing"

","Wonderful solitude","Beautiful beach front cottages, with direct access to wonderful house reef. No question the diving experience was amazing, even compared with Raja Ampat.One exception was that I found it very challenging if you do not like strong currents.The most I took away from this resort was how peaceful and remote it felt. Typically after dusk, we were blessed with complete silence, not even the sound of ocean waves. Few exceptions were the goats, ducks, and crows of course. The dive center was very organized and dive masters were professional and very strict with safety. You will love it!"

","Fantastic service, beautiful diving, vacation of a lifetime","If you want to party, go to Bali. If you want exceptional service, an incredible location in the middle of one of the world's least touched reef ecosystem, excellent food, and beautiful sunsets, go to Komodo Resort.The dive staff went above and beyond; the resort staff are friendly and offer exceptional, personalised service; the food is fantastic -- three course Indonesian lunch and four course Italian supper every day (be careful or you'll throw off your buoyancy...). Overall, this was probably the best place we've ever stayed all-around, and particularly so for divers."

","Wonderful dives and food, but other things could be better","Firstly, I will say the dive trips and instructors were really great. We saw amazing sea life and beautiful coral. The food was also delicious, breakfast, lunch and dinner we were always happy and full! Menu was mostly italian with some indonesian dishes, lots of high quality imported wine and food. That being said, we couldn't help feeling the place was overpriced. For the price we were paying and all the 5 star reviews, the resort had little to offer other than dive trips and food. The bungalows were nice, but seemed a little outdated. Service was good, but not great. It sort of seems like they opened a great resort 5 years ago, and then didn't change anything. It was very peaceful at night, but perhaps so much so that it was a little boring. Music in the restaurant or on the dive boat would have been nice. Last tip: If you aren't a diver, there is great snorkeling right on the beach and also you should try and hike up the mountain behind the resort for beautiful views and do some kayaking."

","Paradise","I was an inexperience newly qualified OW diver and picked somewhere that is not ""recommended"" for inexperience diver like me! However the instructors are great. They look after me. People working there took note of my every needs, They know where I like to dine, what I drink by default ie water! The whole place is very chill. Diving is fabulous obviously! I am a solo traveler thus when comes to dining, everyone does not sit together like a big family. Every 'hut' has their own table. More geared towards couples. However that does not bother me at all. I dine by the beach and have the company of the sun, the sand and the sea and all those lovely people who served me food to keep me company, Great DM too! Definitely heading back again!

It is such a tranquil place, perfect for getting away and doing nothing but snorkeling, eating, watching sunsets, and repeating it all over again! The house reef is beautiful, rich, and lush - literally steps away from the shore. The bungalows are just amazing: clean, beautiful, very spacious, tastefully furnished, and well equipped with anything you need. Hot water and toilets that flush well was a luxury for us after 8 days on a liveaboard. Management and the entire staff are fantastic: they really understand customer service.

","There is only few places like this","Took the 4 nights dive package (7 dives included). Despite high price I must say, it's a good value for money. Staff is absolutely amazing here, taking care of everything, in a professional and friendly way.They have a bit old boat, as most of the Indonesian operators (AFAIK a new one is just being built), but there's everything you need, including refreshment and nice sun-deck with Fatboy Beanbags for chillout.For nature lovers, divers, gourmet food eaters - this is the place to be. Thanks to good visibility in most of the dive sites this is also great place to stay for free divers. Snorkelling around the resort is just out of this world."

","In the lap of luxury .... In the middle of nowhere!!","In the lap of luxury in the middle of nowhere is an understatement to the monumental brilliance of this place. If you are the kind of person that wants the corporate concrete chains kind of luxury then this is not the place for you but in my opinion this is a million times better than any 100-200 room behemoth that has plagued many of the beaches of Bali or the so called Beach dream vacations around the world. What the owners have achieved here is unbelievable, they one day decided yup lets go into the middle of nowhere and build a resort and boy have they built one. They have achieved to build a fully functional resort and not just basic amenities as one would expect in such a remote location. And when you are sitting on the bean bag on beautiful white sand beach watching the most beautiful sunset and sipping on a whisky sour (my poison of choice!), it really dawns upon you the sheer brilliance of this place.There are only 16 bungalows and all of then are right on the beach facing the turquoise waters and couple of beautiful islands in front you. My favorite part of the morning was to pull open the curtain to see the two beach chairs out in front of the stunning water being kissed by the sun and the beautiful island beyond. The actual bed was a bit hard for my liking ( but to each their own!). The room itself is extremely spacious and more than enough for 2 people. The bathrooms are also quite large and they have running hot water. For all of us city slickers who come from the land of excesses, this joint teaches you the meaning of conservation. The island is a dry island, so they have to manufacture their own fresh water OR they need to ship it in from Labuan Bajo. So they do have large drums of salt water to use to flush the toilet and upon checkin they do request you to use that to flush and also be aware of the amount of water you use while showering etc. They clean the rooms in the morning and then they have turn down service in the evening. They would refill your drinking water every morning and if that isn't enough then you can easily walk to the restaurant to top up. One word of advice for those that drink a lot of water, take an extra bottle with you to fill up (the one in the room was too tiny to quench the thirst of two people for us at least, luckily we had our own bottle).The restaurant serves excellent food: The breakfast is a standard buffet with a live omelette station and baked cakes and cookies every morning among other things like pancakes, sausages, bacon, cheese and fruits. The Lunch is Indonesian fare which was very tasty as well. Now the dinner, they serve a proper full 4 course Italian dinner, with starters, pasta, mains and dessert. During your breakfast you will see the menu being written out every day and the staff will come and ask you for your choice for each course, i think this variety for dinner spoilt me and made wish for a bit more variety at breakfast:-)!. The Bar opens up at 5 in the evening and you need to get onto the bean bags and get your view of the beautiful sunset every evening. Alexander at the bar makes brilliant tasting cocktails, his whisky sour was my drink of choice during the week we were there and probably scarfed down a few a day!!Now to the diving, I don't think my wife and I understood the true meaning of ""Pristine Coral Reef"" until we came here. The diving here is breathtakingly beautiful and was made even better by extremely knowledgeable and helpful dive team. The dive resorts we have been too around SE Asia had always changed the tanks and done everything for you, but over here on the boat you need to setup your equipment for the first dive and change your own tank after your first dive. The crew brings all your equipment on to the boat, dont worry you do not have to carry anything, just need to assemble it i.e. connect your BCD and regulator etc. But fret not, the boat crew are always there to give you a helping hand get your equipment setup. The briefing before each dive is so well presented and you can garner from that the high level of knowledge the team has about every dive site. The currents here are unlike we had encountered, but in a good way. I never knew drift diving was so much fun!!! But as always listen to the briefing and follow your dive guide and every thing will be phenomenal. We dived with Leo all through out our stay and he is always smiling and always happy and always willing to help. The entire team of Leo, Luca, Federica, and Engki are just greatWe did have the massage once, i think there is scope for improvement there, but hardly of any concern.Although you will only see a handful, They have 70 indonesian staff working in the background making your stay as brilliant as possible. They are fun loving bunch and are just great!This was one most enjoyable resorts we stayed at, if you are trying to figure out where to go for your next vacation then dont think twice close your eyes and book here. You will not regret it!"

","There is a Paradise...Komodo Resort in Sebanyur","We have stayed in Komodo Resort five days last August 15...I dreamt going there from three months ago but...when you arrive there by boat from Luanbajo and see that natural paradise, the bungalows and a Elena's big smile, you cannot believe where you are...Everything is absolutely amazing, the location, the resort, food, diving and...mainly people who is working in there...Everything is easy going, relaxing, beautiful and...simple in a wonderful way. If you are looking for a luxury place, it is not exactly as Komodo Resort is...If you are looking for something magic in the middle of anything, further than the massive, in a amazing natural atmosphere, with many simple and very careful details and diving in one of the most beautiful sea lands you can imagine, this is the place...Go and See. Many thanks to all the kind and profesional service in the resort, specially to Robert and Leo, great and very easy going instructors, to Sam and Alex the one (super cocktails by a super barman) and ...very very special thanks and kisses to Elena, she is the big responsible of everything works so well in the Paradise.Huges and kisses,Marta&Antonio (good divers with bad regulators ;)"

","Snorkelling and Diving Spectacular","We stayed here for a week as part of our Silver Wedding Anniversary celebration. The location and topography of the island is idyllic and we witnessed many incredible sunrises and sunsets. The whole friendly team were extremely welcoming, every single staff member saying hello whenever we saw them, gardeners, dive instructors, room cleaners et al. The thatched beachfront cottages are well appointed, being still quite new, with private verandas, all facing the setting sun. Nearby dive sites have everything to suit all levels, and the resort clearly provides what it says on the tin. We were even graced with multiple Mantas on a snorkelling trip! The house reef is a veritable soft coral garden with an amazing diversity of fish, though no large pelagics during our stay. Special mention to our dive guides, Luca, Fredericka, Sam and the rest of the team who made sure we were extremely well briefed and didn't miss anything down below. On our last dive, we were just out of luck in being 100 metres away from another group who hung out with a dugong!The gym has an amazing view but desperately needs a ceiling fan!Being in an isolated location, you cannot expect a large menu, but meals range from an excellent buffet breakfast to Indonesian lunches and Italian dinners with choices of meat, fish and vegetables, all very well cooked and presented. I have a gluten intolerance and took some gluten free ingredients with me, which they prepared. The young girls serving the tables appeared so happy and able to joke multilingually that each meal was a joy.We would recommend the trip to Rinca to see the Komodo Dragons which is combined with a couple of snorkelling stop offs.Special mention for Elena, the resort manager, who colluded online beforehand and went way out of her way to set up a massive surprise for our final night, our actual anniversary. Our eternal thanks Elena, you made it really special together with your chef and those wonderful girls who set up and decorated our veranda for an amazing private dining experience! Thank you to everyone!"

We saw loads, experienced currents like never before and made new friends from all around the world.Sharks, Mantas and loads of small stuff followed by a week on Lembongan where we saw 5 Mola Mola on one dive.The scenery in Komodo is majestic a rugged beauty I have never seen before add this to the topography under the water and it can't get much better for the eyes than this.Antonello, you have a great team we hope to see you again!"

","Heaven in Indonesia","We stayed here from June 25th for five days this summer. It is not the most accessible place but once you get there, it is well worth it. Pros - friendliest staff we have ever experienced at a hotel/resort, authentic and delicious Italian food, most beautiful waters and marine life I have experienced (and I have traveled to the Maldives, Caribbean, Hawaii, Thailand, Tahiti...etc) and did I mention the friendly staff that will bend over backwards to make you happy! A shout out to Antonello (owner), Elena, Sam, Lexi, Lavi, Carolina, Cyrillus, Maya, Mauro (chef) and the rest of the staff. We found out that we had met Mauro, the chef, eleven years ago when we were staying at the Four Seasons in Maldives. He was the chef there back then and somehow managed to make his way to Komodo Resort. They got a world class chef all the way in Komodo! What are the chances?We did a snorkeling trip and since we had grandma with us and she did not swim very well (yes, she had a life vest on), Sam, the dive master, accompanied us and held her hand the whole time. Where else can you get this level of service and thoughtfulness?Cons - Aside from the sandflies, there were none. So remember to use repellent."

","A Slice of Paradise","We stayed in this enchanting place from June 25 till June 30, 2015. Although we had exciting programmes to neighbouring islands every day it was delightful to just swim or snorkel from the shore as there are live coral and schools of fish right at your feet. And of course the view of the islands is superb from any angle. As a huge bonus, we had the most delicious meals, especially the Italian dishes that are prepared meticulously and imaginatively every day by Chef Mauro, his wife and his excellent team. During our stay, the only annoyance we had to put up with was the army of sandflies that refused to leave us alone, especially on our last few days. Otherwise, we had a smashing holiday at this beautiful resort."

","Amazing location and Food","Amazing location and Italian ownership conspire to make this place a rare find. They are fully booked in high season, but it is much better to go when the place is only half full and falls in sync with its tranquil setting. Hard to believe they have been open for a little over two years, because the place runs like clockwork. Foreigners will marvel at the setting, but those who’ve spent significant time in Indonesia will be floored that such a place exists in this country. It has excellent management, super-friendly staff and some of the best diving/snorkeling in the world. The location also stands out for being remote in the best possible sense. Komodo is an archipelago of islands and this place is the only man made object on one of them. This means no traffic, no noise and no pollution. One cannot say how long this will last, because it is rare in the 21st century. Furthermore, it doesn’t lack any of civilization’s key appurtenances. The bungalows are simple, yet tasteful and well equipped. In other words, you will dine and gallivant like a king, despite being in the middle of nowhere. This is a desert island with a barista.The owner has built a fantastic resort and its reputation is not far behind. The staff is very well picked and well trained. The Italian chef manages very well despite the inevitable supply problems. Getting the right olive oil and and pasta in such a location at a reasonable cost is a huge advantage for them. But they do not operate in a bubble. The owner and the manager are fluent in Indonesian and are connected to the local community. I enjoyed spectacular pineapple and bananas here."

The diving resort is fantastic and took great care of my newly certified 10 year old. My 12 year old and I did 8 amazing dives and we look forward to returning!The diving in Komodo is breath taking! The dive boats are comfortable with bean bags and sun shades on the top. The best part after coming up from a wonderful dive is the hot tea and cookies! We also enjoyed the towels! The accommodations are perfect, with very nice huts on the beach, clean, hot water and stunning views. The food is wonderful and the resort accommodated my healthy/picky needs! We love this resort!

","Paradise Found","My girl friend and I first found Komodo Diving Resort through Trip Advisor in August of last year. We are both SCUBA instructors, have each worked within the industry for literally decades, and have travelled from Antarctica to the High Arctic and many places in between. We had spent 6 weeks on an expedition ship throughout the Kimberley in Australia, and then up into Indonesia. Our trip to Sebayur was a way to wind down and just relax after an intense time. Little did we know how much we would fall in love with this place, and even more so with the people who run it. It was so perfect that we booked again in June of this year, staying for a full 2 weeks!So why in the world return to the same area? Simply stated everything you could possibly expect from Indonesian waters is to be found here at Komodo Diving Resort. All the charismatic megafauna like manta rays, sharks, turtles, but also amazing little critters to make any diver or snorkeler happy. We spent an average of 6 hours a day in the water, exploring every nook and cranny of the house reef. We punctuated these days with boat trips to all the must see areas, and they were all amazing, but I cannot stress enough how fascinating the house reef is.It is so easy to get into and out of the water literally right in front of your bungalow. Time spent in and around the dock yielded so many photo opportunities. Then just drifting with the tide as it changed allowed us to cover great distances and yet stay perfectly safe. One of our snorkel sessions lasted five and a half hours...it was that magical (cuttlefish mating)! Whether you are a beginning snorkeler, or a seasoned diver, you must allow yourself the pleasure of the house reef. Night snorkeling on this reef is a priority as well...The bungalows themselves are about as perfect as you can get. Clean, spacious, comfortable. The bathroom is ingeniously separate from the living area with plenty of HOT water and space to dry out your wetsuit or diveskin. Fresh water is always a concern on an island without any, so you have the OPTION of using salt water to flush the toilets, which are western style, or simply use them as you would at home. Air conditioning cools your bungalow quickly and efficiently, even when you leave it off while you are out diving or snorkeling. The views from the lanai are spectacular. Bungalows are spaced far enough apart that you hear or see very little of your neighbors.And now to the best part of the entire place; the people who make your vacation the best it can be. Owner Antonello is on site and seemingly everywhere. A true Renaissance man who helped design and build the entire resort. Still an avid diver and guide and a wealth of knowledge for the entire area. A reliable resource for whatever questions you might have...Elena is the perfect hostess, making sure you are comfortable and well looked after. She is an avid diver herself and will help you make the best decisions for just where you want to go and what you want to do. The trip to Rinca to see the dragons is a must and she will facilitate that for you.Head chef Mauro prepared scrumptious meals worthy of a fine restaurant (like the 2 he owned and operated in Italy prior to coming to Indonesia)! Meal times are spread out and you can come and eat at your leisure. Meat, fish, and vegetarian options allow many choices for all. Try the Granita for dessert!And then the Indonesian staff, nearly 70 of them in total. Everybody from the girls who serve the meals, to the guys who load and fill all the gear and tanks for diving, to the groundskeepers who keep the place spotless, to the folks who clean the bungalows. These people are the life blood of this resort. Truly a delight and it is obvious that they are committed to your enjoyment of Komodo Diving Resort.Perhaps the best way for me to tell you how much we love this place is that we are looking at booking it again in 2016. It is that amazing...Mille grazie Antonello e Elena. A presto!"

","Great resort, well located with fantastic diving","We spent 5 nights here and it wad truly amazing!! It is perfectly located so you cut down on boat time to the dive sites. Bungalows are great with own sun beds. Food is superb with Indonesian lunch and Italian dinner with suprisingly broad offer of wines. Diving is world class, and we saw plenty of Mantas including the all black. However, dives are in very strong current and not for beginners. In addition, there is a great house reef for the non-divers or the over active. Highly recommended place!"

","Cozy getaway at the edge of the world","Where to start with this review... spent 5 nights on Sebayur Island at the welcoming Komodo Resort and Diving Club. Customer service was top notch! Dive instructors and guides were accomplished, professional, and extremely helpful. I had not dived such strong currents before and was able to learn so much from everyone! And, everyone was so patient with me and my camera set up. The food was amazing -- set menus to choose from, usually featuring Italian or Indonesian cuisine. The staff were attentive and so very friendly. Yes, we had some complications leaving the area with the volcano eruption, but if I could have stayed on the island longer, I would have!! Bonus: good wifi in the common areas. Though, I would have enjoyed my stay just as much without it. Was able to connect in other ways! The most amazing sunsets right outside your door, the Milky Way overhead and night, and waves slowly lulling you to sleep after a long day in the sun and water... perfection!!"

","Fantastic house-reef and amazing staff","We spent 6 nights in July as a family vacation. We decided for Komodo Resort mainly because it is close to Rinca Island (Komodo dragons) and, as snorkelers, for its house-reef. What we didn't know was how amazing is the people who run the hotel, from the staff to the management (Elena and Antonello). If you're not a diver you can easily snorkeling in front of the bungalows, even with low tide or you can simply relax on the beach. In the area there are lot of spots for snorkelers (we saw Manta rays, sharks and turtles) or divers and the hotel can help you arrange daily trips. The sunset on the hill behind the hotel is a must. Grey herons, eagles, kingfishers are other guests you can see on the island.Thank you Komodo Resort"

","This is where you want to stay and dive in Komodo!","We spent almost a week on this idyllic island, diving some amazing sites in the national park and dining Italian style. Free minutes spent snorkelling the lively home reef at the beach right outside our bungalow. The staff and dive guides are as lovely as they come, and we really felt welcome. If you should happen to be on your honeymoon, like we were, be warned! They might just arrange a surprise romantic dinner just for you."

","Best holiday we ever had.","The place is absolutely beautiful, and the resort is lovely, like something out of a novel. Diving is fantastic,saw a lot of animals that we didn't see in our first dive at great barrier reef.saw a few Manta Rays. Diving conditions can be challenging for newer divers at certain sites due to currents. The house reef is fantastic, and we wished that we spent more time snorkelling there. The reef is literally off the beach. In fact, we had trouble putting on our fins as the reef was so close to the shore. Staff were all happy, friendly, and made us feel at ease. The divermasters, Leo and Patris had safety in mind at all times, but we're really helpful. We really enjoyed ourselves, and it is money well spent. The only fault I would say is bad WiFi, but you shouldn't be using WiFi in a paradise like that, not while there is so much more to do."

","An absolutely enjoyable holiday","The resort is beautiful and the view is breathtaking, but the best thing about this place is the people who run it and the people who serve you day in day out. The owner we met, Antonello, is a delightful man who makes great effort to train his staff. We found that really heartening especially because the resort provides meaningful jobs to people around the area. Elena, Leo and Luca are always cheerful and ready to share their experiences on the island with guests. Leo was amazing on the dive trips; always helpful and watching out for us. Sam, who was our snorkeling guide, is a gem and we really enjoyed our snorkeling trips with him. We loved the cocktails by Leksie which we enjoyed in the beautiful sunset every evening, before the sumptuous 3-course dinner every night by the resident Italian chef! We should mention that the sky here becomes star-studded by 6:30pm every night - it's beautiful and our non-DSLR camera does the sky no justice. Thank you to all the smiley ladies and gentlemen working in the restaurant, for making every meal such an experience. Even though the resort is on a remote island (the very reason why everyone should visit this place), it has everything you need for an unforgettable holiday, including good massages and a good selection of wines! The staff at the resort will also bend over backwards to organise any day trips you might want to experience and we highly recommend the flying foxes tour. This resort is a must-visit for everyone who enjoys the beach, the sea and the sun - and abundance of excellent service :) The people here truly believe in what they do, and we really admire and respect that."

","Great place, great dives, great staff.","I stayed from the 23rd June until the 28th and although I was expecting to have a good time, it was much better than I imagined. Everything works perfect, from the moment they pick you up at the airport until you unfortunately need to get back there to leave Komodo. The hotel is located is a small island isolated from everything, so expect plenty of time to relax, I took the diver package so I had my dives in the morning and the afternoon to just explore around, relax at the beach or simply sleep a bit. All the staff is very friendly, and they really try to make you feel comfortable, Helena was always always keen to help, or give advice about different options, or just simply chat with you, and that was a common thing with all the rest. My dive instructor Leo, was extremely good, very professional and willing to improve your diving skills, and the dive sites well, they were just amazing, I had one of the coolest dives where apart from the corals, plenty of fishes... we saw at least 6 green turtles, and that was only one of the dives. I also did the afternoon trip to Rinca to see the Dragons, and although we saw one next to the entrance that looked almost like placed there, at the end of the trail we managed to see one moving through the bushes and really looking as what you would expect them to be. As for the bungalows they fit perfectly in the environment, the inside is simple but comfortable, and special mention to the food, really good!! So I just can say yes, it is not the cheapest option, but it also gives you a lot more than what you usually get in South East Asia."

","Thanks to the team for an excellent mini break","My partner and I had an excellent 4 day trip to Komodo Dive Resort.The team were very hospitable and did their utmost to make guests feel welcome, relaxed and fed. Special thanks to Leo, our dive instructor for the first two days who was the consummate professional and showed a real commitment to ensuring the safety and enjoyment of divers. We had some great dives and had a Manta swim right over us, one of the highlights of my diving experience so far.My tip to travellers is that this is an excellent place for divers and snorkelers but if you want to see the Komodo dragons do as much research as possible before you go on the best way to see them. We squeezed in a 90 minute walk on Rinca (after the 2 morning dives and a longer than expected boat ride to get there) as the sun was starting to go down.We did see 4-5 dragons but only around the main office and we suspect are very well fed (like house pets!). We learnt after the Rinca trip that the the best time to see the dragons is in the morning and even then you are quite lucky to see them in their natural habitat on Rinca as they generally stay in the shrubs. We did hear some reports of spectacular sightings of other guests but we weren't so lucky. Also the guides can be a bit hesitant to take you on long walks so a bit of persuasion is necessary."

","Great place to be in for diving","It's difficult to describe in words our experience of this place so i'll try and keep to the standards. Right from the pickup to the drop to airport - the service has been excellent. Genuinely friendly people - and not just the owner but every staff member right down to the non-English speaking gardener! Komodo resort is on an island - so the whole staff team is like one large family and and the rapport they share results also in great service. Location is of course unbeatable. The corals as you just wade out into the waters are amazing. Room is beautifully done. Though there was a dreamy mosquito netting provided, we didn't use it and preferred to keep our windows open at night. Didn't use air conditioning as the natural ventilation was excellent. Rooms are about 8 meters from the sea!Food is just great. The cook seems to enjoy churning out meal after interesting meal. On the first day that we landed i was a bit overwhelmed with the quantity of food and worried about wastage. But portions were quickly altered to suit our needs. Menus are discussed individually every morning and the days meals are set at breakfast. So we are told what's the menu for lunch / dinner and we can choose from a couple of different options. The options were interesting enough to try various things over our 5 night stay. Surprise food of great interest for me were the quail eggs and an excellent crab dish. Western cuisine was great but Indonesian was also superb.Snorkeling right in front of the rooms is a feast with so many corals and fish. Diving was amazing. Not just because of the wonderful fish and coral life under but what made it really special for the extra care that the instructors take. Komodo resort does have good diving spots within easy reach but i am an 'uneasy' diver having learnt to swim quite late in life. So i was nervous about the current - having had Luca to first kit us up and Leo taking us on the dives we felt safe. I haven't felt as safe underwater as with Leo. Antonello - the owner of komodo resorts, an italian with a big and friendly heart, is himself an ardent diver. So safety, care and an understanding of every person coming to dive has been given great importance at this resort. I'd definitely love to go to this place again.I think what i liked best about this place is the easy relaxed atmosphere in the resort and the care that was given to a 'shy' diver such as myself."

","Not sure if it was worth the price tag.","The accommodation is nice. Rooms are basic but comfortable. The downside for us was that the hot water ran out quickly and a number of wasps found their way into the room. We were surprised by the aircon surcharge when it was asked that you use it as little as possible. The location is beautiful. The island location certainly saves time getting around Komodo. The kitchen and waitstaff are exceptional. We can't fault the food (very generous with many courses). They had European dishes and lovely cheese too.The diving however was hit and miss. The final two dives were sensational but the previous few were average. We were partnered with other divers who had varied skill levels which limited the scope for dives. One diver didn't have certification while another didn't follow instruction from the guide. Having additional Indonesian guides may be a better way forward. Overall our experience was mixed. If you are mad for diving perhaps consider a liveaboard. My husband wishes we had."

","Possibly the best place I've ever stayed","We stayed here for 4 nights in May and couldn't get over how amazing it was.Getting there was so easy compared to anywhere else in Indonesia - 1 hour flight to LabuanBajo, short shuttle bus to harbour, then a beautiful scenic boat ride to an island that seemed like an actual paradise. I've never seen anywhere so beautiful and unspoilt. There is no rubbish. The managers and staff as so friendly and helpful, and come chat to you every day about the next day's dive sites etc. The food is amazing. The diving was spectacular and the best we have seen, and very professionally run and safe too. The bungalows were comfy, air conditioned and right on the beautiful house beach. Even the snorkelling is world class. And those sunset drinks...This resort offers amazing value for money, for $250 AUD per day (approx) you get 5 star accommodation, 3 world class meals, and 2 dives. We will return again, without a doubt. So many more dive sites we need to get to!"

","Paradise in April","We visited for 4 nights in April and cannot say enough Great about this amazing Marine Park Resort!The owners Stephano and Antonio and Elena (manager) have given so much emphasis to detail, one would think they are on a mainland developed island!Getting to Labuan Bajo and out to Komodo Resort is seamless! New airports, scheduled daily flights, and boat ride out was much easier than we anticipated. With the speedboat it was only 25 minutes, and with the Large Slower Boat about 1 1/2 hours of enchanting scenery. Cruising around many islands jutting straight out of the water to weave around, it was really spectacular. The flight from Bali took us on a short flight to Labuan Bajo, ,Flores, where the pier is literally 10 minutes drive (no traffic!) to their private Boat waiting to transfer you to this Amazing and Eco friendly Paradise.The entire Komodo Marine Park is unbelievably clean, we saw NO LITTER floating anywhere - and anyone we spoke to in Labuan Bajo (35 dive operators) all were in accord with Conservation for their blessed environment.We are Not divers, but snorkel and were really impressed with not only the many sites for coral viewing, but the House Reef. That was a truly unique experience, and straight out front of the resort! We saw many colours of hard and Soft Corals, as well as Nudibranches, Clownfish, Angelfish, Trevelly, Jacks and basically a kaleidoscope of fish and coral colours, every colour under the rainbow actually! On all the trips the assortment of marine life was phenomenal. We swam for over an hour with 8 Manta Rays just on the first day! Second day More Mantas! Huge Sea Turtles, A couple of larger Octopus, Napoleon Wrasse, Big Jacks, Many Micro Fish full of florescent colours! What was also Unique, was the sealife waits for you to finish viewing them! (Very Polite), we always left them, to go see more, at another place, or return for Dinner! Also we went to Rinca. I was with my 2 sons, and knew that would be a highlight. What boy doesn't want to see a real life Dragon? We saw 4 larger Dragons andwe were lucky enough to see 2 juvenile Komodo Dragons. One was leading the way on our hiking path - our guide said he was ...our 1st guide! Another polite animal - in the Marine park! One must wear sturdy shoes for the hiking.We used the kayaks, were on daily boating/ snorkel island viewing trips/ lots of feasting on the many courses and plentiful menu. The dining area is Divine! Who has Italian Marble tables in a beachfront openair Dining Room? They do- they really had oudone themselves, again, in the Dining and Drinks department. There was Plenty to do. Upstairs was a gorgeous wooden upstairs TV and DVD room with exercise equipment, but we never needed the extra entertainment - I had a massage which was super and they were building a lovely wooden massage space on the beachfront while we were there. We went to Komodo island resort in hopes of Paradise and a well preserved Marine Park and this was Exactly what we found.The resort itself is quite amazing. I certainly didn't expect to find beautiful Italian linen, gorgeous wooden handcrafted furnishings, lots of space in the villas for unpacking, small stylish reading lamps, plush bedding, clean ample filtered water always available, Giant bathroom with Eco-Friendly amenities, Tasteful and immaculate Wooden beachfront Villas with unreal views of the many stunning islands across the crystal clear water from your sliding wood/glass door. A lovely front porch with plentiful drying space and sitting space to watch the sunset was just a BONUS!The resort is run by 2 Italian gentlemen, and the attention to detail shows everywhere. Their dedication to conservation is apparent and their passion for conservation addictive. When we returned home, to Western Australia, we became more conservative of water. It was suggested to be aware and respect the water use, as well as all aspects to retain the pristine environment. Well it works, and now our everyday life is more water conscious. I cannot recommend a better place to stay for Enjoying the pristine environment of the Komodo Marine Park.We will return again, and again!Jen Michael and Eric"

","Amazing place","My friends and I arrived at this resort and were met by a bubbly manager who explained in details about the resort. First and foremost water is an important commodity and so we had to be careful using it. The chalets are right on the beach , very clean though dark inside. The air condition worked well which is a plus, as we were in another 5 star resort in Ubud prior to coming here where the air condition was struggling.The resort is on an all inclusive basis, and the owner is Italian, so be prepared to eat pasta everyday, though the menu for both lunch and dinner were quite extensive. Breakfast was a bit limited, but on the whole we had a lovely time with snorkeling just on your front door, and daily dives arranged. Take extra cash if you plan to visit Rinka island to see the Komodo dragons, and dont miss out on this, as this is the only place in the world where you ll find these giant lizards. Overall great place, very clean, rooms and public places, amazing beach front chalets, good menu, friendly and very helpful staff. Heaven on earth"

","Best diving experience, but not a five star resort","It somewhat troubles me to not give this place 5 stars, but I feel that several thing should be made aware to other travelers. If you are an avid diver like myself, this is the very best corals and diversity I have seen - even right outside your room for snorkeling. However, if you are traveling with somebody who is not that much into diving it wouldn't be as good an experience. Let me provide some insight to other travelers and the resort itself at the risk of sounding a bit like a snob. First, when you are greeted at the airport, we usually get wet towels to refresh ourselves and when we have a 45 minutes boat ride we would expect cold water to be provided - it is very hot. Second, the food was not five or four stars, but lacked in imagination and several basic things were not available, like selection of teas, different options for eggs and some decent food for vegetarian. Third, I did find some of the diving equipment somewhat overused, not a problem if you are a serious diver and bring your own, but I had expected better equipment. That being said, the staff is awesome, the place gorgeous and if you love diving or snorkeling it is absolutely a paradise. We also loved the trip we took to see the Komodo Dragons, snorkeling was great, lunch decent, but staying under the covers upstairs watching Dolphins and other boats sailing past was a perfect way to travel. One word of advise- get an air conditioning room.....it is hot. The import question is always - would you go again, and for me that is a big yes. The place is just amazing for divers, but I would let my wife stay at the resorts in Bali. "

","AAA+ resort and dive center!!","I spent 5 days at Komodo Resort with my family. I am a professional diver but they are not even divers and we all have an amazing experience. The daily trips to the National Park are just what you would expect from it and the little island where the resort is it's great. I mean, don't expect a ""resort"" ni the fancy way, have to keep in mind it is located in a national park right in the middle of nowhere in a tinny island. But the installations and service are outstanding. Everybody is so nice and helpful and the rooms/bungalows are stunning. The beach around the pier is just unbeliabably good for snorkeling (please try night snorkeling, you will be amazed!). As I professional diver I have nothing but compliments to them. Great people, great professionals, great dive sites, great boats and crew, nothing to complain about.If you have the chance to dive with them or just to spend a few days and visit the park you won't regret!"

","Best Experience Yet!","We ended our trip on Java here and it was amazing. Not only are the villas/huts beautiful and private, but the food and staff were excellent. We didn't dive - friends of ours did and raved about it. We snorkeled and of all the places we've been, it was by the far the best! There's a reef right outside your door step, which we took advantage of almost every day. We still talk about the experience and I doubt anything will top it! If you have a chance to visit Indonesia - this place should be top on your list!"

","Could not have been any better!","Having just spent 6 days at the Komodo Dive Resort, I felt compelled to tell everyone how wonderful it is! From the first minute of a sincere welcome from Elena to waving her off at the dock, our visit just could not be improved upon! The staff, both dive and resort, are brilliant, they cannot do enough for you and are a delight to get to know; the accommodation is spacious, spotlessly clean and literally on the beach; the food is first class, more than enough choice for everyone to be happy and to gain a few pounds and finally, the diving -superb - a few rip roaring currents but always kept safe by our dive guide and masses to see. The house reef is also amazing, one of the best we have visited. The trip to Rinca to see the Komodo Dragons is also well woth doing. All in all, we had a fantastic stay at this resort and look forward to returning there one day, thank you to Antonello and all his staff for making it work so well"

","Amazing, you won't want to leave","Spent 5 glorious days with Antonella, Elena and their wonderful staff on the Sebayur Island.From the moment our both pulled up to the jetty to when we got back on to leave, the staff made this a very special place to come dive, relax, make friends, eat great food and be entertained. The place has the feel of an idyllic paradise where everybody can do nothing but smile and be spoiled by the people, fish, coral and island! It would be great to have spent more time out there but alas......Even if you are not a diver, it is worth the trip and defintely get out on the dive boats on their daily trips and snorkle the magnificent waters.And as mentioned, the staff, they are great; interact with them as much as you can!"

","Manta Ray...why not","Me and my partner went to this resort on last Oct. 2014 and got so many great experiences in Komodo Resort & Diving Club. After landed in Labuan Bajo Airport, not too long waited, employee from resort picked us with boat from Labuan Bajo port to the resort, it took around 45 minutes. And...paradise just outspread in our eyes, white sand, blue water, and Elena were welcoming us in that resort very warmly. We stayed around 4 days and 3 nights. Accompanied by Italian foods which were served so delicious, i got my weight up around 5 kilos...hahaha... Please prepare your sunbath cream and enjoy your tanning time, while sleeping on the beach. I took dived 6 times and we found Manta Ray...not only one, two or three, but around ten manta ray. Not only manta ray, but we found baby shark, barracuda, sea turtle and many else and don't forget...a beautiful colorful coral view. At the last day, We traveled in the morning to komodo national park, saw the habitat of komodo dragon and back afternoon. We walked around our island, hiked hill behind our cottage and found perfectly sunset...you should try this...All of the trip was wonderful... :)"

","An amazing resort with an excellent house reef","Visiting Komodo Resort and Diving Club is not easy. We took a domestic flight from Bali to Labuan Bajo where we need to take another 1.5 hour boat ride to the resort. We stayed in Bali the night before and caught up with an early flight the next morning.The resort is relatively small with just 16 Bungalows. The owners are Italian and most of the staff are from Europe. There are about 60 staff serving the maximum occupancy of 40-43 guests. On arrival, we were greeted the the manager Elenor. We came to Komodo mainly for diving. We were totally satisfied with our diving in the resort.We started on dive with a check dive in the afternoon in the day of arrival. Normally there were two morning dives. Afternoon dives and night dives are arranged upon request on an extra costing. The boat leaves around 8am and by 1pm all will be back for lunch. We were led by different DMs, either local Indonesian as well as Europeans. My wife and I were quite satisfied with the standard and guidance. The only thing that one may have a word is that the divers have to set up the gears and change the tank by themselves. We almost saw sharks and big stuff everyday. Small critters were also easy to see with the help of DMs. Since there were only two morning dives, we dare not to use Nitrox as it did not make a lot of difference to us.The house reef is wonderful and it's one of the best we have ever seen. A big school of Trevally seemed to be there everyday!They serve Continental breakfast, Indonesian lunch and Italian dinner. The quality was excellent, almost ""Michelin"" standard under such a remote environment and location. The room was spacious with a balcony overlooking the beach. It could be quite hot in midday, it would be nice to choose a AC bungalow if possible.We traveled to Komodo Island to see the Komodo Dragons. On the way back, we stopped by the Pink Beach and Manta Point. The Pink Beach gave you a pink colour because of the sand. Snorkeling in the Pink Beach was not as good as in the house reef. The Manta Point Snorkeling is something worth mentioning. We jumped into the water but there was no manta. Our guide Sam, a local Indonesian staff insisted on doing one more times. We hopped on teh speed boast again and this time we saw two mantas. The experience was so wonderful for our kids as they never saw such a big creature swimming under their belly. My younger boy was very scared in the first instance when he saw it and tried to swim away!In summary, this is a cozy resort with not too many guests. It's a place where you may feel the staff have an intimate care and service to you. We always compare Wakatobi Dive Resort with Komodo Resort and Diving Club. I think both have their merits in different aspects. Wakatobi seems better in a sense that it provides a camera room for divers which is quite near the Long House. This facilitates divers very much especially for those serious UW photographers. But I am sure that Komodo resort may have this facility sooner or later."

","Felt like a movie","Where to start.... this place is paradise. The boat ride to the resort from Labuan Bajo gets you warmed up for what's to come. But nothing can prepare you for the sheer beauty of the resort and island that you find once you get there. I don't want to spoil the experience, so just a few quick pointers below: - the bungalows are beautiful, super clean, and eco-friendly - it doesnt get much better than this- the house reef is better for snorkeling than literally all the spots we visited on a day tour from labuan bajo to komodo park - on our last morning, we saw four turtles within an hour!!- the day trip to rinca island is fantastic and the snorkeling on the way back phenomenal (we swam with manta rays and visited the most impressive coral garden i've ever seen)- when back at the resort and before or after dinner, go have a drink at the bar. with the music on, sitting at the beach with a cocktail on your table on a remote island with no other resort than this one, you truly feel like a filmstar!the only thing that could perhaps improve is the dining. the meals are huge, nicely presented and lovely, but a simpler and more diverse (or less Italian/European take) menu might be a welcome addition. the price certainly looks steep when compared to other places in labuan bajo, but we definitely think it's worth it. you get paradise at your doorstep, extremely good service with everyone of the staff being very nice and helpful, and a not-to-forget experience that will make everyone happy. thanks Elena and your team for an unforgettable stay - we thought Komodo Resort was the highlight of our entire trip!!"

","Better than Imagined","I thought that the island would be nice but it exceeded my expectations. What we found instead, was something out of a dream. As soon as we stepped foot on the boat to take us to Sebayur, we were greeted by the friendly staff. The ride was about 1.5 hours and pleasant. The upper deck had big bean bags which made the ride more enjoyable. As we approached the island I was so thrilled to see how beautiful it was with the aquamarine water, white sand and the lovely bungalows with thatching. We had the good fortune of getting to know some of the other guests and we decided to pull our tables together so we could visit during our meals. The staff left our tables together for us each day so we could all eat together. The staff was friendly and accomodating at every turn. I expected to be roughing it much more, but the food was great and they provide plenty of it. Trust me, you will not go hungry. The bungalows are simple but clean and spacious. The diving instructors were all very knowledgeable and I appreciated our diving instructor's (Leo) never-ending patience with us. I have problems equalizing my ears, but I never once felt pressured to be quick instead he made sure the dive was comfortable and safe. Before each dive, we were shown a diagram of the diving site and instructed on any difficulties we might encounter and what to do. After our dives, they had a snack of buiscuits and hot tea or water on the boat. The owner, Antonello was a fantastic host. He was friendly and very likable, and extremely generous, as we found out, when I discovered I had forgotten my contact lenses. He gave me some of his own contact lenses to use so that I could see during the dive. I would have never expected that, but he went out of his way to make sure our needs were met. I could write a book about this place there are so many good things. It is one of the best trips we have had-- there were good diving sites (even right next to the resort), so much sea life and coral, a spectacular retreat on the island (you really do feel like you are far away from it all), and great staff. If you are fortunate enough to make it there, and you have a chance to visit the the "" secret pink beach,"" don't miss out! It is stunning and pristine. Thanks to Antonello and all the staff at Sebayur for a wonderful time."

","Stunning Sunsets","After a 1,5 hour boat ride from Labuan Bajo we arrived at the island of Sebayur and the first impression of the resort is stunning with all chalets self contained and spread along a white sandy beach either side of the beach bar and open plan dining room. The islands are surprisingly green which gives a pleasant contrast with the blue sea. We were met on the jetty by Elena the manageress who went out of her way to be friendly and helpful at all times. All other staff smiled and were ready to assist. The rooms are well appointed and are air conditioned which is welcome in the humid and hot weather. Our main reason for going to the island was for diving and we found the DM's to be very thorough and competent. Dive sites were varied and the water warm although we did experience some raging currents at times. Nearly every night whilst sitting at the beach bar there was a spectacular sunset which was stunning. Food at the hotel was varied and plentiful. Excursions can be arranged and we visited the nearby Komodo island where we went into the National Park and saw 10 dragons (they are huge) and buffalo. This was a very worthwhile visit. Thoroughly enjoyed the stay at Komodo Resort and would not hesitate to recommend it."

","Beautiful Resort in an amazing setting","We stayed here just before Christmas and I was concerned as I knew it was rainy season. But I needn't have worried! The island is one of the driest islands in the archipelago and even though we could see the clouds gathering over the main island (Flores, where Labuan Bajo is located) every afternoon, they never seemed to reach us. The staff at the resort are wonderful and so accommodating, Elena, I don't know how you keep track of everyone's wants and needs so well! The huts are not huts, but very comfortable, air-conditioned, en-suite rooms, very stylish and clean. The restaurant serves a set menu with 2 or 3 choices which changes each day. The food is great, Indonesian for lunch and Italian for dinner, with a lovely little beach bar for reasonably priced pre-dinner drinks and watching the sunset. As everyone has mentioned, the house reef is amazing! I don't dive but was more than thrilled with the snorkelling. The rest of the family were thrilled with the diving, which was well organised and professionally conducted. Can't recommend this place and the people there enough. It's definitely worth visiting and do it soon, before it becomes spoilt. Labuan Bajo now has a new airport and the government are promoting it as THE next tourist destination!!"

","Perfect Stay in a Beautiful Location","Arriving there by boat we were not stunned but certainly stupefied as the Islands looked almost like Egypt: some green at the banks of the Nile and behind the dunes (almost bare hills). It's in fact a very dry area which makes it fully intelligible you are advised to save fresh water. Anyway, the nice bungalows are spacious with a covered, sometimes hot Veranda and outstanding view plus white beach in front. Enjoy the most beautiful sunsets of SE-Asia at the bar. The alternation of Indonesian and fine Italian food leaves you with almost no unsatisfied desires. Both Indonesian and Italian staff are friendly and very helpful (including office mgr, DMs and boat crew). The northern Komodo region is a fantastic diving area providing an incredibly rich maritime life at a number of spots. The boats are unusually spacious and provide a shaded ""sun deck"" (you probably do not wish to get too much of the burning sun), comfortable thus. The boat staff frees you of almost any work with your diving gear - however breathing ought to be done by yourself. Most DMs are capable and very nice, particularly Frederica. Only minuses are maybe that the tide movements do not always allow to visit all the possible, partially remote spots. And the Indonesian kitchen actually is richer than the provided one. If you wish to extend your dinner at the bar you should hurry a little bit as the bar tender tends to close the shop early if there are no guests at near sight.Unlike most other visitors, the four of us stayed entire two weeks. And we did not regret a single second spent at the Komodo Resort. All in all a perfect stay to be repeated and to be recommended."

","Perfect Diving and Snorkelling Location","The Komodo Resort is 90mins by boat from Labuanbajo, halfway between Flores and Komodo. As such, it is the perfect location for anyone seeking to dive or snorkel in the Komodo National Park - or see the dragons. Beautiful teak bungalows are stretched along the beach either side of the central bar and restaurant area. Each bungalow was designed in a traditional Balinese style, to the owner's specific design. They are roomy, comfortable and very well appointed. The food is excellent, with Indonesian food at lunchtime, followed by Italian cuisine in the evening. A choice is always available - as are three courses from the hungry! The diving operation is very well managed and transfers to the dive sites are obviously much shorter than they would be from Labuanbajo. The staff are a mixture of European and Local - and cannot be faulted. I highly recommend this resort to you"

","An unforgettable holiday","I booked this place to end my holiday in Indonesia. I was sure to find a beautiful and pristine place, since I had a look on the pics and on the other reviews.. but as soon as I put my feet on the pier my mouth was stuck open and my eyes were enchanted ! beautiful place.. cozy huts very clean and spacious.. nothing is missing.  10 steps far from the bungalow you have an awesome house reef.. full of fish and healthy corals. you can snorkel here for days and you never get bored.. you can either do some kayaking but pay attention to the current, it can be very strong.. also, we went out following the divers boat and we saw manta rays and plenty of fishes in some beautiful spots. boats are comfortable, with a big sun deck with bean bag chairs to relax.staff is one of the best I found here in Indonesia. all very young but attentive, helpful, friendly, smiling all the time .. you can feel they are happy to stay and work there and this makes you feel even more like at home. We knew we were going on a remote island where you might not expect  high level of cuisine.. well, I had to change my mind.. food is simply SUPERB ! both Indonesian food and Italian food are simple but delicious. we spent a week and we had never eaten the same dish, the best food I had in Indonesia! Nothing to say, memorable holiday. one of my favorite place ever.. congratulations to the whole team for the wonderful job they are doing. Just a pity that I cannot give 6 stars review.. this place would deserve it !"

","Amazing experience for the whole family","We loved this place; even though it's a dive resort which in my experience don't always cater for kids our 8 year old son enjoyed snorkeling and kayaking on the house reef, jumping off the jetty and particularly Sam whom was the snorkeling guide on the boat trips away from the resort.All staff, Indonesia and Italian alike were friendly, polite and nothing was too much trouble.Food is excellent with Indonesian for lunch (3 courses) and Italian for dinner (4 courses). Only minus would be that there was probably too much of it (not sure if this is a minus!) and Italian cooking can be a tad rich in a tropical island setting. Dive operation had great attention to detail, safety and responsibility without being overbearing. Each dive was introduced with a thorough briefing and hand drawn map over the dive site. Huts are spacious and comfy; lovely crisp white sheets and towels, steaming hot water and useful attention to detail like outside light switches that glow in the dark. We took the deluxe AC option which was modern quiet and efficient and we needed as it was very hot at his time of year. Oh and of course Komodo is the most stunning archipelago so the diving and scenery are outstanding! Thank you. PS There is also a gym of sorts if you can manage running on top of two- three dives per day!"

","Absolutely a right choice","tayed in Komodo dive resort for 5 nights, we actually did think about if we should pick Komodo dive resort or Liveaboard and since my husband seems not really want to stay on the boat for 7-8 nights ( for comfortable reason ) so we finally picked Komodo dive resort. The hotel room actually is a bungalow, its very comfortable actually with a stunning view, and we were really impressed that they are trying to be more environmental friendly for example they ask all guests using salt water to flush the toilet after use ( so they will prepare a huge bucket of salt water inside the bathroom )Since theres nothing on the island except the hotel ,so hotel will provide all the italian / indo food for you, and I can say its the best diving resort food ever, I can feel they did put lot of effort for getting the italian ingredients and italian chef really did a great job! we were looking forward to the meal time everyday!For a diver, the resort just like an heaven on earth, we did 2-3 dives a day ( together with a very good DM ) for the remaining time, we either lying on the sunbathe bench or kayaking along the area or snorkeling ( and its the best snorkeling place ever in my life! ) so if you are not divers you can still have some fun but yeah maybe stay 3 nights, for divers i think at least 1 week there, unfortunately we didnt have that much time :( you will love it for sure if you wanna dive and sleeping on the solid ground with great food and facilities i wish i can be back next year for more diving!"

","Exactly what we were looking for","Komodo Resort is a perfect stay for people wanting to dive in the Komodo National Park and surrounds. To travel from Labuan Bajo each day to the dive destinations is really quite a long way. Off LBJ, there are only 3 options - Angel Resort, Kanawa Resort or Komodo Resort. Komodo Resort was perfect as it was further out than the other options, so each day we had greater access to dive destinations. Besides its location, I was amazed at the services that were provided to us on such a remote island. The rooms were beautiful, the hospitality spot on and the food was good. They also have a new bar which is perfect for sunset drinks, along with great day beds on the water for those not wanting to dive (and a top house reef for snorkelling). For those interested in staying close to Komodo dive sites and still enjoying great hospitality, I couldn't recommend this place more."

","Diving was great but what a house reef...","I picked the Komodo Resort because of its location on Sebayur Island out in the middle of the sea between Labuan Bajo and Komodo. I didn't want to deal with the extra time it would take to get out from Labuan Bajo to a dive spot and given the speed of most of the boats in the area (slow) it was a wise choice.The diving was almost everything I would have hoped it would be. Great reefs and lots of sea life. I saw things I hadn't seen before. I just wish I had seen more big schools of apex fish. Not sure why I didn't. Could have been bad luck. I hope it wasn't because Komodo is in danger of being fished out.The service at the resort was fine. You are given options for lunch and dinner meals and the breakfast is served buffet style. Like other operators the dive boats at the resort are not the fastest on the planet. Those who are used to high speed fiberglass boats that one would would find in places like Palau, where you could journey 30 miles for a dive, are in for a bit of a culture shock. Not that I'm complaining mind you. I hit plenty of quality dive spots but the lack of speed did limit our range to the North and east sides of Komodo and I was left wondering what there was on the West and South sides. I want to make special note of the resort's house reef. I haven't snorkeled everywhere in the world but this was easily the best snorkeling I've ever had. Given its location I would have been let down if it wasn't this good. I saw Barracuda in five feet of water. I never see Barracuda this close to shore. Other schools of open ocean fish also came by. And the soft and hard corals are in very good condition.We caught some bad luck with the moon. It was waxing from crescent to full while we were there which blotted out the stars for six of our nights there. But the first night took my breath away. I never saw the Milky Way galaxy in all its glory like that before. I would definitely come back here again. But I'd have to scratch Raja and Lembeh off my list first."

","Wonderful diving","We stayed 4 nights.My husband thought it was some of the best diving he had done in Asia. They were very professional and the boats went from the resort so no transfer times.Lunch was good as it was an Indonesian chef that if he was allowed to cook without interference would be great. We not big pasta eaters so dinner was not the highlight of our meals.If you don't dive there is nothing else to do so keep that in mind if only one half dives.Although it was a Eco resort and again one of the best accommodation for a diving resort in Asia, they had air con which is great but you had no flushing toilets which I think if I knew I would not of stayed.Staff was friendly but as a none diver I had to wait until the divers returned at lunchtime yo get a juice."

","""A touch of Italy in Komodo Dragon-land""","Had we stuck to our original plans, Sangeang Api's unexpected eruption would have aborted our stay at Komodo Resort. Instead, Garuda Indonesia's unrelated - and initially unwelcome - rescheduling of flights from Denpasar to Labuan Bajo probably worked in our favour and the only daily reminder of Sangeang Api's eruption at Komodo Resort is the thin layer of volcanic ash that covers unattended items left outdoors. And the gentle swirl of tiny ash particles in the beam of one's torch at night.The great deal of thought that brought Komodo Resort into being and sustains its existence is evident in the architecturally imaginative use of eco-friendly local materials in the buildings; 24x7 electricity; 1-hour/day free WiFi at the restaurant and office (more than adequate, in our case); high-quality Indonesian and Italian meals; young, enthusiastic, friendly and well-trained multi-lingual local staff.The two de luxe bungalows that five of us occupied have air-conditioning, ceiling -fan and -lights, electronic safe, full-sized wardrobe, writing desk, twin beds with LED reading lights, and a convenient waist-high wooden shelf running along the length of the bungalow on both sides. The 4-gang multi-plug extension cord that we brought along ensured no shortage of electricity outlets for charging our cameras, smartphones, iPads and Eneloop batteries. Fresh drinking water is supplied daily in a pitcher. The bungalows are cleaned daily and a nightly turndown service includes deployment of mosquito nets over each bed. The large verandah was perfect for hanging wet gear to dry and lazing in balmy evenings.The bathroom is big and well-lit. Effectively a wet room, it features a washbasin with large mirror and vanity lights, a shower with hot and cold running water in one corner next to a sit-down flush toilet. Used toilet paper is disposed of in a small bin to avoid clogging the toilet system. A tub of seawater is replenished daily so that Eco-conscious guests can use it for flushing the toilet. Good quality bath and hand towels are provided and each guest also has a microfiber bath towel to bring along for boat dives and water sports.The bungalows are located in the morning shadow of the ridge that forms Pulau Sebayur's spine. The late afternoon sun is ameliorated by the shade of a long island across the strait.The house reef is one of the most beautiful I have encountered and a great venue for snorkelling. 20-40 minutes away via dive boat are famous scuba diving sites like Batu Bolong, Pulau Siaba Kechil and Makasa Reef (aka ""Manta Point"" from Nov-Mar, when it's eponymous namesake is reportedly abundant). Currents can be strong to very strong in some of these sites but are worth braving for the pristine beauty - when in doubt, abort the dive!We didn't have any memorable encounters with pelagics but the abundance and diversity of healthy corals in a myriad colors I'd not previously experienced remains foremost in my mind.Also memorable were excursions to Rinca island to witness Komodo Dragons in their natural habitat and the boat excursion at dusk to see thousands of hungry giant-sized fruit bats soaring across the sea from Pulau Kalong to feed in Flores and Pulau Rinca. Would we go back? Most certainly!"

","A bit of Italy in Indonesia...","Just knowing before you arrive that this place will not be crowded (i think they have ""only"" 16 bungalows) made me relax beforehand :)We arrived early and booked a private transfer. Keep in mind the boat (or our boat at least) goes painfully slow (almost 2u!!)... but hey, once you arrive, all is forgotten and you are warm welcomed by all the staff. The staff in this resort is extraordinary !! Bungalows are supercool and couldn't be happier with it. Perhaps next time i'll definitly consider aircon instead of fan... wow, it was quite hot....:)The food.... i'm a fan! Everything tasted very good with the spaghetti carbonara as my favorite dish! The only thing i would recommend them to do is to offer something in the afternoon (a little snack, cake, ...) because between lunch and dinner, stomachs tend to make some noises ;) and since you're on an island and there is no shop to buy something.... could be an improvement in my humble opinion.The diving was ok but it's the reason they don't get 5 star rating from me.My checkdive was totally NOT ok (practically no briefing, debriefing and the equipement is in pretty poor condition and i didn't have the right size!) and i had to wait more than 1 hour on 2 other divers who had just arrived... Was very disappointed and talked afterwards with the divemanager. Was a good talk and he arranged the right equipement for my next dives but still, the zipper of my wetsuit was broken, one of my fins was teared up .... pffffffBut all considered, the diving itself is pretty amazing... On one of the dives i saw 3 manta's so i was on quite a ""high"" afterwards :)"

","A place I want to return to","I was ten days at Komodo Resort last Fall with my husband relaxing and diving between two birding tours. After three weeks of Indonesian food I was quite happy with Italian. This really feels like Little Italy in the middle of nowhere. Diving was excellent, much better than I expected. The island is just so peaceful, you really feel away from everyday worries. Roberto, the divemaster, was possibly the best one I have met, I got many useful tips to improve my diving. Dinners were just amazing, we loved the food. Of course, it was Italian style, almost two hours to get through the different courses, but so enjoyable. One of the few places I have visited that I definitely would like to return to."

","Fantastic for divers","We stayed 4 nights at this resort based on the outstanding Trip Advisor reviews. The resort didn't disappoint. Lovely setting, great beach and some of the diving and snorkeling is as good as anywhere in the world. The resort deserves 5 stars without doubt. However, anyone planning a visit should take into account that diving is the main activity and there is not a huge amount to do for non divers, other than snorkel, which is (excellent). My wife doesn't dive and 4 nights was enough for her. When the dive boats are out, the resort feels empty. Divers should be aware that one of the reasons the diving is so good is that here the Pacific and Indian oceans meet. Brings lots of fish but also at times difficult diving condition which require experience and skill. Having said that the dives are professionally run to the highest standards. The food is a combination of Italian with some 'westernised' Indonesian dishes at lunch. It was good food but not great and there are no alternatives available. While under Italian management, most staff are local from the nearby Flores island. Without exception they are friendly, courteous and clearly enjoy working at the resort."

","best snorkelling resort in the world (so far)","I was her 5 nights June 2014 and believe this is the best snorkelling resort in the world (so far) I have been to.From years of snorkelling in many places around the world I think I have now concluded Indonesia (have done Bunaken Island and Komodo National Park Diving Resort so far), the Maldives and the Australian Great Barrier Reef on a livaboard are the best bets, although I still need to try Fiji and maybe Bonaire fits here too . But so many other well recommended places have been comparative disappointments I think I need to focus on these for the next while. So what made Komodo the best?-- great house reef--the diving trips you can tag along with do not treat you as a second class passenger as is usually the case. In fact snorkelers got their own guide and as there was usually only me snorkelling a private one at that. Sam was incredible at spotting mantas, turtles and everything else way before I did and also at locating lobsters, stone fish, lion fish and others and helping me dive down to them. He will soon move on to be a dive instructor but i am sure they will get a good replacement. If they have enough snorkelers the even do special snorkelling trips, but that was never the case while I was there as there were mainly divers.-- the coral in the area , both hard and soft, is the best I have seen-- the fish life was like an aquarium, and there were lots of mantas (even though we were outside the season), turtles and other large fish-- although i saw no sharks-- the semiarid topography and the nearby islands made for one of the more interesting locations I have snorkeled at. There were free kayaks to go to a nearby island. And there were several easy hikes on the island.-- the nearby Komodo dragons were worth a side trip with good snorkelling stops on the way back-- the 2 hour boat trip from Labuan Bajo (Flores) was great watching islands go by while lazing on the deck roof--the management was top notch, friendly and helpful, as were the serving staff in the restaurant. A special note of appreciation to the manager Elena and owner Stephan. All the details re booking, transfers etc were painless and i was able to pay at the resort with a credit card .-- the Italian meals were great, and the wine affordable given the taxes Indonesia imposes as a Muslim country.-- the huts were all you needed. Get the AC, although after several days you will not need it as you get acclimatized.I do not know how the resort could be better and will certainly return.One tip re flying from North America (Ottawa for me) is to break up the trip. I did that on the way stopping in Hong Kong / Macau, Boracay Phillipeans, Singapore, and Bali. On the way back I went straight back with an arrive late / leave early in Singapore and long airport waits and flights. Even though I got upgraded to business from Hong Kong to Ottawa the return trip just about destroyed me. So break the trip up and enjoy the going, being there and return parts of the trip."

","Outstanding level of service in a remote location","Just returned from a ten day stay at Komodo Resort, celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary. It's a friendly place with access to great diving and sight-seeing. Though there are only 16 bungalows on Sebayur Island, there are over 60 staff working hard to keep the resort beautiful and your stay memorable. Considering there is no fresh water on the island, what they have accomplished is incredible. The only regret I can think of is that I waited so long in our stay to snorkel the house reef and walk around the whole island, a six mile jaunt. Those two activities gave me a much better perspective, but earlier in the week I was too busy relaxing or taking day trips to visit the flying foxes, water buffalo, dragons, timor deer and other sights on neighboring islands. Mornings, of course, were for dives out in the blue, blue lee sides of islands and small rocks jutting out of the current-ridden channels. Though somehow I only managed to fit in 12 dives, 3 of them were on the exquisite world class site, Batu Bolong, with its remarkable populations of both small and large fish . . . and outstanding hard and soft corals . . . and invertebrate populations. Even my absolute favorite nudibranch, the blue dragon, can be found there. 1 also dove Manta Point where I watched 18 mantas of various sizes swirl around me. My wife, snorkeling above, counted 30, 2 of them larger than any I saw. The other dive sites were pretty average for Indonesian destinations . . . and that's a pretty high average! Travelers like myself who enjoyed Indonesian destinations like Lembeh Resort and Wakatobi will probably like it here. If anything, Komodo Resort is a bit cozier, friendlier and laid back than those resorts. The food is just as good."

Bungalow is perfect, electricity for 24 hours and fresh water always there. It's a five star facilities! Food also very good, they have Indonesian and Italian, International food. Many options of dessert, always give me a giggle when the waitress mention how many granita they have.

","Booked 4 Nights Stayed 8","If you can afford it DO NOT miss this place. I loved everything about it and didn’t want to leave! (BTW I usually hate all inclusive resorts) It is a 1.5 hour boat ride from the port at Labuan Bajo. The boat ride is included in the cost. They have an office on the main street in Labuan Bajo. It is only one of two places to stay within the limits of the Komodo National Park.A 1st class place with a laid back vibe. The Italian owners and both the local and foreign staff are friendly and fun with a true desire to make your stay great. Each bungalow has comfortable beach chairs and a big porch. The rooms are clean, spacious with AC and a big western bathroom. Internet is free for 1 hour a day or you can pay 10 Euros for a full day. It wasn’t a bad thing, it kept me present during my time on this beautiful island. The food is too good and they serve way too much (3 course dinner plus dessert) it’s the Italian way. Try a Lexi a drink made with the local alcohol that tastes like a mojito. (Alcohol and soft drinks are extra) The house reef is stunning so make sure you spend some time checking it out! The dive shop has a wonderful DM, please tell Fredrica I said hello. The dive sites are much closer than going from the mainland and they are magnificent.One of my all time favorite places to stay and to dive!

Everyday there were surprises, as we saw lots of healthy coral, sponges, tropical fish, dolphins, sea turtles, and manta rays, etc!

It's easy to see mantas, sea turtles and tons of astonishing corals. The place is hot but cool when there's shades and breezes. The resort is cozy. The size of the room and the bathroom is huge. The bed is very comfortble. Fabulous corals just in front of the resort when snorkeling. Beautiful sunset to see when sea kayaking and small hike to the heels behind the bunglows.

","Absolutely fantastic!","I was there last week with my wife, and we had a great time! The location is simply fantastic, it's an ideal place for relaxing and for enriching oneself with the beauty of the view. Every evening we had amazing sunsets that we could admire from the beach, from the hill top, or while canoeing. The reef is spectacular, such a rich variety of coral and fish that you almost don't need to go anywhere else for snorkeling. Talking about that, I'm not a diver, I can hardly swim, yet I had plenty of things to do in five days: snorkeling was superb (either at the resort or in other locations reached by boat, where for example we had also the chance to observe a lot of mantas!); we did a ""discovery scuba dive"" with an excellent instructor who made us feel very safe, and it was a wonderful experience; we went to see Komodo dragons in Rinca, and then flying foxes (highly recommended!); finally, we borrowed a kayak, we did some hiking, and of course we also just relaxed. The whole staff is very professional and friendly. Food is very good (both the Indonesian lunch and the Italian dinner - we particularly appreciated the homemade pasta and desserts). The bungalows are beautiful and comfortable, AC in the room, and free wifi in the dining/lounge area. In conclusion, the whole experience was superb and we fully recommend it, especially for young couples or groups of friends."

","Understated Luxury, Gorgeous Diving","Komodo Resort does a wonderful job of exposing the charm and aesthetic of Indonesia while accenting it with an Italian warmth. It feels luxurious but not decadent. In traveling through the Philippines and then Indonesia, I have found that too often hotels cater to what they anticipate foreigners will like rather than what the indigenous spot has to offer. Komodo fuses Indonesian flair with an Italian sensibility. It feels like you are staying with a mixed extended family.For the divers, the inclusive price of dives, room and board is very fair. In our case, we were a group of four and for 2 out of 3 days we had the spacious dive boat to ourselves. Irvi, the dive master has a wonderful demeanor and took us around to beautiful spots. The diving around the hotel is stunning. The upper deck with bean bags was an incredible way to spend the way home. If you are looking to see the dragons, stay here and take a day trip. We dove in the AM and went to Rinca in the afternoon for a 3K hike. You have to be up at the crack of dawn to attempt to spot them hiking as they are in the shade by 10AM. We had originally thought to camp on Rinca or Komodo, but SOOO happy we decided to stay here instead. For snorkelers, the reef just off the hotel is an amazing variety of corals and sea life. We spotted rays, reef sharks, turtles, octopi and cuttlefish in addition to the more common and colorful varieties. The food is Indonesian at lunch and Italian at dinner and always plentiful. Breakfast is either buffet or order and also filling. They have a small but delightful wine list (Gavi at lunch after a morning dive...what's better than that prospect?) Elena and Antonello were both incredibly welcoming and hospitable. In addition to sharing a birthday cocktail with local sopi liquor, they went above and beyond in helping us with an airline ticket snafu at the end of the stay. We also appreciate that they employ a staff of 60 Indonesians that provides a valuable salaried position and training in the hospitality field. Surely that will come in handy as this beautiful corner of the world develops further. In short, Komodo Resort is worth flying around the world to enjoy."

","No really a resort","I stayed for 5 nights. When I researched this area, there weren't very many choices of hotels to choose from. They started at the highest, Komodo and jumped to a budget price of $40. I was very torn on what to do. I was traveling solo so I decided to go with the Komodo resort. Guessing it would be safer, etc. When I arrived in Flores, I didn't realize it was going to be a 1.5 hour boat ride to the actual resort. I suppose I didn't do proper research. I could have easily stayed on Flores for cheaper, saw the dragons and dived. Here are the pros and cons of my stay.Pros: Enjoyed the airport transfer and greeting at the dock of resort. Loved AC. Food was good especially considering it was imported. Loved having access to as much drinking water as I wanted w/o being charged extra for it. The bungalow is lovely and spacious. Loved the turn down service in the evening. Loved having a fridge. Gorgeous reef right outside my bungalow. The massage was very relaxing. The locals were super friendly and eager to help. Stefano saved my life!! Literally!! He knew what to do in an underwater emergency. Cons: Would have rather ate meals at my leisure instead of set timing. AC didn't completely cool all the time. In defense, it was really hot. The bungalow had a fan and AC but it was explained to me that if I put the AC on, they charged me extra for the room. Hated paying extra for internet. Hated the slow boats to see the flying foxes (furry foxes) and the dragons. If it would have went just a little faster, maybe there would have been a breeze! Also, you had to smell gasoline fumes the entire time. The resort boasted being eco friendly but let boats slam anchors down all over reef. Not sure if they can do anything about that but just saying. The beach washed up tons of trash. I saw people cleaning the beach once. There is no spa. The Italian staff were friendly but you got the feeling they were ready to go back home. I didn't appreciate dealing with my dive equipment. Most places wont let you handle the tanks, etc. I know how to do it, I just don't want to being on vacation. With that said, I should have paid more attention. 2nd day, first dive, I ran out of air 10 minutes into the dive. My tank wasn't filled properly. I'm familiar with PSI not BAR. Wished they offered more than 1 type of red/white wine by the glass. My T-shirts shrank, ALOT!"

The resort has Internet access in the lobby however. The trip from Labuan Bajo to the resort took more then 1.5 hours, a little bit long. But the landscape is so beautiful that you forgive time passing. Rooms are spacious essential and clean. All have sea view and a pleasant terrace. Cleaning service in the room is very good and respectful of customer habit. Food is good and abundant, Indonesian at lunch, Italian for dinner. Desserts make you sure you wont loose weight even with three dive per day in strong current. Finally the diving is superlative for the location itself and very well organised from the diving guides. I always dived with a group of my skill level."

","Great diving and wonderful food","My husband and I had a wonderful stay and dive trip here. Diving was fantastic. Each day we dove somewhere different and dive sites included a variety of dives from deeper dives with a lot of current to slower dives looking for small stuff. We saw lots of mantas, too. The food was amazing - buffet breakfast, Indonesian food at lunch, and multi course Italian dinner at night. Tea and snacks on the dive boat. I was glad I brought my reef hook as some of the currents really rip and there is so much soft coral everywhere you can't really find a bare rock to grab on to. To my horror I dropped an important piece of equipment over board and the staff of the dive center came to my aid with a replacement first stage so I could continue diving. We were surprised that the dive staff do not set up your gear on board the boat or change tanks in between dives -usually a standard with almost everywhere we have dove and worked (we have both worked in the dive industry as Dive Masters). The resort is owned and run by a group of Italians and they have made an arid island into a comfortable and luxurious dive resort. Our room was very clean and comfortable. They do have wifi at the resort so you can stay connected if you want. I also enjoyed snorkeling out in front of the resort - it was like a little nursery there with quite a lot of fish - from exciting and colorful individual juveniles to larger schools of fish.We also took an afternoon trip to see the Komodo dragons on Rinca Island. It was pretty cool - if you are going to go on a longer trek you will want some better shoes than the flip flops I had on. The resort picked us up at the airport, took us to the office to make our final payment, then drove us to the harbor to catch the boat to Sebayur Island."

","Special place","This resort is special in many ways - remote, peaceful and stylish. The island is beautiful and the sunsets are amazing. The food is fantastic and the bungalows are great. There is nothing to do but relax, snorkel on the house reef, and dive. Komodo diving is excellent - varied, exciting, and at times a little too challenging with the strange and strong currents in the area. An experienced guide you trust is imperative - with Irvi and Roberto the underwater rock climbing and changing currents seemed normal after a few dives. These are the dives you see the mantas and sharks so the effort is worth it. The more gentle dives like Batu Bolong are also stunning and the fish cover is fantastic. Very special place and resort."

","Awesome, stunning, exhilarating and fattening!","50 minutes by speedboat from Labuan Bajo means the resort blends into its own island right on the edge of the Komodo national park, and is only an hour by boat from what must be the most exciting dive sites in the world. This place is in a class of its own. The spacious bungalows are perfectly designed and the food is incredible, with an Indonesian lunch, and a varied 3 course Italian themed evening meal plus desserts. And I never eat desserts - you have been warned the chocolate mousse and crème caramel are awesome. The staff are great, and genuinely add to a low key but classy setup, and they all obviously have a good relationship with the management.The dive boats are powerful, well organised, and the boat crews expert in handling expensive cameras and are always ready with a gentle helping hand whenever needed. The dive guides are likewise superb with the flamboyant Roberto giving dramatic and detailed dive briefings which hold your attention - something that is very important when diving in the sometimes wild and unpredictable Komodo currents. Irvi, while more reserved, offers a background in marine conservation and tourism - always topical with scuba divers, and there is a gentle written reminder of our ""contract"" with nature in the bungalows. The snorkelling on the house reef is quite extraordinary with big bat fishes and cuttle fish under the pontoon, and sea horses can be found in just one metre of water! Proof of how they look after their immediate environment.We will be back!"

You can find more than you can imagine: Mandarin Fish, Mantas, Sharks, Tunas, Frog fishes, nudibranchs, ghost fish, octopus, boxer crab, shrimps and lot of pygmy sea horses. Batu Bolon was my favourite, we did twice.About the accommodation, the room was very good, clean, huge space, quiet and with all the details as the minibar fridge.The food was buffet for breakfast, Indonesian for lunch and Italian for dinner.

","Excellent location & dive sites; resort okeish for the price","The location is really nice; a decent sized island with only the resort; there is a high hill, more like a small mountain, that make for an excellent hike: spotted what I think was a sea eagle and a wild herd of goats; there are mangroves in places; the path up the hill is marked but not easy due to erosion, better have good shoes. It seems that the resort is planning to build luxury bungalows in secluded bay at the foot of the hill, right now that part is still unspoilt.The resort itself is to very high standard; the bungalows look really nice; however we opted for the cheaper non air-con option and we suffered for it.In the evening the sand flies are a real pest; carry plenty of repellent with you; the resort get the beach sprayed once in a while but it does not seem to be effective.Snorkeling the house reef is nice but keep an eye on currents, the place is in narrow channel and the water can flow really fast at times.The food in the evening is varied and they have an excellent chef; my problem is that my main meal is at lunch time, at that time the meals are repetitive and not so appealing, as most divers are still out.The main gathering areas are in the large dining patio, at the tables, and in front of the diving shop; the staff is mainly made up of Italians & Indonesians; I missed an area in the shade with books and seating; they have a large sitting room space on top of the kitchen but nobody frequented it; they plan to put a bar there; it is still work in progress; no library or amenities yet (diving books only in diving shop); so not so good on that level; I ended up hanging more around my bungalow; the resort is expanding (+2 bungalows being built) before more attention is paid to the general comforts in communal areas, in my opinion.Diving sites are good and with plenty of fish and corals, turtles, reef sharks; we spotted two mantas in over a week we were there.The boats are not so good; they are slow, wooden hulls, with small engines and quite a few people tend to gather in the upper sun deck, and the stability is sometimes affected: once the skipper curved so much that it seemed the boat could not straighten up itself; it was not fun!I never saw any oxygen cylinders for diving emergency in the boat.So all in all considering price I think that:location is top, but due to various issues mentioned above and the high price I would give a 3 & half star; there does not seem to be an alternative besides live-aboards."

","Just enjoy!","Everything in this resort deserves the highest score: The very cozy and comfortable bungalows, the great location, the restaurant with its excellent cuisine, which can be compared with a 5 star hotel, and diving. Roberto and his dive did some absolutely excellent dives with us which are amazing even for experienced divers. The entire staff is very friendly and accommodating, and the ""whirlwind"" Natalia always ensures a good mood. The journey might be a bit tedious, but it’s worth doing it: we will be back for sure!"

","Paradise","We stayed 6 night at the resort. After 1 1/2 hour of boat trip the resort appears as a surrealistic place. It is situated on Sebayur island surrounded by islands all around it. The bungalows are wonderfull. I still don't understand how they could realize this so far from everything. There is airco, a very spacious bedroom and a bathroom with hot water. There is also a very nice veranda in front of the bungalow and you have your sunbeds on the beach in front of the bungalow. We did 6 dives and the dive sites are wonderful. For lunch you have a 3 course meal and for dinner a 4 course meal. For lunch it's Indonesian food and for dinner Italian food. The resort is especially occupied by Italian tourists. I think about 60 % are Italian. The dive staff are also Italian except one dive instructor who is from Indonesia. So if you like Italian food and Italian dive staff you will feel at home here. For us 6 nights was enough. Every night Italian food is a little too much. The local staff in de restaurant is very friendly and helpful and very professional. We did also a trip to Rinca island to see the Komodo dragons. After lunch on the boat we went snorkeling and we were lucky to see 2 mantas near pink beach during snorkeling. We loved Komodo resort and you should come at least one time over here. The beauty is overwhelming."

","Paradise, Relaxation, Turquoise Water, Amazing Coral and sealife","We just returned from 3 nights 4 days at Komodo resort Sept 6 - 10. After traveling for two days our arrival here made up for the long travel days. The staff was very friendly. The dive instructors were knowledgable, friendly and patient. My husband was diving and I was snorkeling it was some of the best we have seen. Lucky enough to even see a manta ray even though the season hadn't really started yet. The dive boat was comfortable with room to relax on the upper deck in bean bags.The accomodations were very nice, clean and comfortable. We didnt have the AC in our room and wish we did. I would recommend getting the bungalow with AC as it was quite hot and uncomfortable trying to sleep especially with no windows to be opened and for fear of mosquitos we didn't want to leave the sliding door open. The food provided was just fine not great, nothing special. We didnt care for the Indonesian food here and elsewhere throughout Indonesia so this is no fault of the resort. The italian dinners every night were well diverse for the three nights we were there. Always something different. The pasta was the best part and always our favorite part of the meal. The other entrees, usually fish or chicken was just OK, usually quite dry. Breakfast was minimal with pancakes, fruit and eggs."

","Absolutely amazing, a true paradise","I stayed at Komodo Resort with my husband in December 2012, which is in the low season for Komodo and we were totally blown away with the beauty and resort. We run our own dive shop on an isolated island and found all prices more than reasonable or quite cheap for how much it costs to get items to the resort and the hassle of getting it there. The staff were very friendly and accommodating and we loved that everyday at breakfast we could pick what would eat for lunch and dinner and what time we would like it served. A really great touch. Great snorkelling off the beach right in front of our rooms with lots of things to see, be wary of strong currents if your not a very good swimmer. The diving was some of the best I have ever experienced. We had ample Manta Rays even for the low season, I had never seen one before and even with the strong current, the Manta Dive was amazing. The guide Roberto was fantastic, waiting for other boats to finish before we jumped in to eliminate over crowding on the site. All the dive sites were amazing, with more coral, critters and colour than you could imagine. We are huge Nudibranch and macro fans and we were spoilt for choice on all the dives.The resort were very efficient with arranging our tour to Rinca Island to see the Komodo Dragons and even organised pack lunches for us on boat trips so we wouldn't miss out on our lunch. When it came for us to pay, the invoice was very clear and well presented. We were a bit difficult for them having to pay with split currencies and half in cash and half on card. This did not phase them at all and they were happy to accommodate us for this.We will definitely be heading back to Komodo Resort in the future and have recommended the resort to many travellers."

The stylish beautiful interior (songkat from Sumba). Full-board and great food. Even breakfast is beautiful. Indonesian style lunch and Italian dinner (because of the Italian management and many Italian guests during high season - Italians love to have Italian food abroad!).

","Best land based diving in Komodo","After making our way from the airport to the boat dock and boarding a wooden boat we were a bit apprehensive about what the resort would be like. We knew a soon as we rounded the corner of the island on our water taxi and saw the bungalows that this place was going to be awesome ! The staff imeasiatly cane out to greet us and make us feel at home. The food is Indonesian for lunch and they have an excelant Italian chef that prepares meals in the evening, they come around in the mornings and plan your meals with you, and were very accomidating when there was something on the menu that wasn't to my liking and made some changes. They were also very accomidating with the dive plans, they asked every day what we wanted to di and also suggested which lenses I should use for certain dive sites. The boat crews were very helpful while boarding and I boarding and the diving did not disappoint,, we will definitely be back !"

Our bungallow was fantastic, with large and stylish room and bathroom, good A/C system and excellent view towards the sea and neighboring island. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The FB meals were fantastic! The hotel also provides free pick-up from Flores by their private boat which is very convenient. Although their services are mainly directed towards divers, we were there on the non-divers package, and the 'house reef' is nice for snorkeling. Moreover, you could go together with the divers every time and enjoy snorkeling. I already miss this place and wish to return!"

","Small piece of paradise in Indonesia","We had a terrific time at Komodo Resort & Diving Club, the bungalows were a good size with a large bathroom and bar fridge. The staff sprayed the rooms every night and put the mosquito nets down. All the bungalows were waterfront and had a fantastic view, with absolutely the best sunsets every night. We stayed for 5 nights and went out diving and snorkeling every day on the very comfortable dive boat, (really enjoyed the comfy bean bags on the top deck of the dive boat). A big thank you to Willy our dive master who took us to all the good dive spots and was very knowledgeable. My husband is an experienced diver and he found the diving to be interesting and with the strong currents quite challenging at times. The dive operation he found to be well run and quite professional. Myself being a snorkeler went out on the dive boat with the divers. Most of the sites were suitable for snorkeling, but if they weren't, I would sit upstairs on the comfy bean bags and read a book and take in the breathtaking views, which was very relaxing.The food was plentiful and the local staff were always there to make sure you were enjoying your stay.Would agree with the previous review about the payment system, (wasn't very satisfactory at all.)If you love diving and snorkeling then we would recommend this resort for your shore based Komodo diving destination. We also would recommend a five night stay on the liveaboard boat, Moana, which we also really enjoyed and got to sail around the beautiful Komodo National Park."

","Not a 5-star resort, but definitely a 5-star+ vacation experience","My wife and I spent a week at Komodo Resort in March, bungalow number 5 with A/C (A/C costs extra, but we HIGHLY recommend it). We did three dives a day for the first five days and then combined diving and Komodo Dragon viewing (very worthwhile) on the last day. Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable, unforgettable week.Pros:1) Best shore-based diving we have ever done (using the hotel's dive boats -- the only option available), despite so-so underwater visibility due to heavy rains the previous week. Blizzards of large and small fish, beautiful hard and soft coral, and dramatic drift diving (Beware: this is not a destination for beginner divers. There are dozens of small islands here and 5+ feet of daily tidal surge, creating flukey and very strong currents in the channels among the islands.) 2) First-rate boat crew and dive-masters. Second to none, in our experience.3) The view from the 14 bungalows -- all 14 are ocean-front -- is breathtaking, especially at sunset, and especially from the bungalows situated north of the restaurant area. We have never seen a more gorgeous seascape from a hotel window (see photo).4) Large, well designed rooms with big, en suite bathrooms. Not luxurous, but roomy, comfortable and private.5) Friendly, helpful staff. Professional on-site management.6) Did I mention the view at sunset was sensational? Absolutely mesmerizing.Cons:1) Customer service during pre-stay booking was sluggish and clunky, and hotel policies are inconvenient and onerous for prospective guests. It sometimes took a day or two to get a response to an email inquiry. Once we decided to book (this took several days to nail down due to the lag time between emails), they wouldn't allow us to pay the necessary deposit with a credit card. They asked for an ""international bank transfer"" of the funds, and in Euros, not dollars. Who wants to navigate this type of transaction when booking a hotel? Not me. Later they offered to take the deposit through Pay-Pal, but they charged an extra fee for this -- something like 20-25 Euro. Also, Pay-pal is awkward if you're not used to using it, and we found that there are potential pitfalls and hidden fees (eg: unfair exchange rates) associated with international transactions on Pay-Pal -- buyer beware. Once we got to Flores -- the port town located 90 minutes from the resort by boat -- management required us to pay our stay in advance at an office downtown before we boarded the boat for the island. After paying this bill (we were allowed to use a credit card at this point) we waited more than an hour and a half in the sweltering office for the boat transfer to the resort. All of this could have been avoided if they agreed to take a credit card payment online, or even over the phone. Travelers want real-time communication with rerservations staff, and they want the convenience -- and the consumer protection -- associated with online credit-card payments. Komodo Resort falls short in both of these crucial areas. Also, travelers shouldn't have to pay a extra transaction fee to a hotel just to be able to put down a deposit. If a hotel insists on a pre-paid deposit, and it refuses to take a credit card online and prefers a different form of payment for its own convenience (Pay-Pal, in this case), then it should pay any associated fees and not put them on the guest. 2) The restaurant was only average, and not up to the standard we expected considering the price we paid. We heard through the grapevine that they were ""between chefs"", and (if true) this may have been part of the reason, but food was mostly bland, with little seasoning. Lunch provided on the dive boat was very basic as well.3) This is NOT a resort for non-divers. There is nothing to do except dive during the day and enjoy the fabulous setting at sunrise and sunset. We are divers, so this was just fine for us, but if you don't dive then I wouldn't recommend staying here.Bottom line: Guest-hostile booking policies and mediocre food are more than offset by the brilliant diving and the world-class beach-front location. A magical week, thoroughly enchanting. If you're a diver and you want to dive the Komodo Islands from a shore-based accommodation, this is the only place to stay."

","Everything we expected and more.","Planned this trip for a long time, and combining with Raja Ampat. Having travelled to the area once before on a liveaboard we knew what to expect with the diving.It didn't disappoint. From an hour with many manta to 30 mins with one 5m oceanic right through to finding a blue ringed octopus on a site never seen before, and everything in between.Of course diving in the wet season meant just that, we often got just as wet above land and in the boat but the boat crews, and dive crew did everything they could to please us and every other guest. We really couldn't have asked for more. In fact we're sure they brought in a local guide just for us at their expense (we're painfully slow divers).The food was excellent as were the staff in the restaurant. Indonesian for lunch, Italian for dinner and anything and both for breakfast. Considering you're in the middle of nowhere it's quite remarkable.Accommodation too was better than expected. I do recommend paying the little bit extra for aircon, it's not perfect but on days where it feels like 40o out there it's worth it. Helps with the mozz at night too. One last thing. You must find the time to walk up to the top of the Island, it's breathtaking, photos will never do it justice.All in all a pretty amazing trip, Stephano the owner is intent on ensuring every guest has the best, Roberto the current instructor is superb and has a trillion stories to tell, Anke was our divemaster, currently freelance but Stephano would be mad not to snap him up.We don't often re-visit the same place but this might be worth a second go in the dry season, better start planning now. :-)"

","The diving and food are very good, but a bit pricey","We stayed 2 nights there for our honeymoon. The diver instructors were awesome, they know when the Manta and where they will come, so they will just guide you to a spot for you to wait rather than chase after mantas. We did 2 dives and saw 1 on the 1st dive and at least 7-8 on the 2nd dive.The food is gorgeous! Especially their italian cuisine. Also snoorkling just around the beach you can already see so much soft corals that you don't see normally elsewhere. We found it a little pricey though but guess it's on a private island, everything is needed to brought in. Plus diving, we spend over a thousand US dollars for diving, rinca island trip plus accomodation and full board over a short stay of 2 days. The only downside of the whole experience is during the bookings. We called up the hotel and quoted the offer from Tripadvisor, and was told that no room is not available. But agoda shows it is available, so we booked it there. Then when we asked the tripadvisor discount again and was told that it won't apply since we booked it through agoda. We tried to convince them and we were told the last night was not available and we will be given 50 euro refund and they will book us a room on the main island for that night or we stay at the director's room. We accepted the director's room and 50 euro discount. A few days later, we were told 2 customers cancelled their booking and now they have the full availability for the 3 nights.It's just a little confusing this back and forth, if we could have been given the room in the first place when we called, at least the owner of the resort can save their commission paid to agoda, and we can also save some through the tripadvisor promotion. Also when you book through agoda, it's not very clear so we didn't know that standard (rather than deluxe) doesn't come with air conditioning and we need to pay 25 euro extra a night for it. Also booking through agoda, we can't enjoy the diver package which is more economical than buying diving trips alone. So in total, we paid at least another 100-200 euros more.It worked out alright in the end, the manager Stefano arranged us to see Komodo dragons and 2 dives in one day as we only have 1 full day there due to missing a flight. But the experience could be so much better if the management of the resort can take a little responsibility with messing up the booking issue and more flexible in how it is being handled."

","World class diving","Without doubt one of the best diving operations you will find anywhere, in the middle of a national park with stunning and varied dive sites. We had a five night stay, and saw a huge variety of underwater life, from mantas down to tiny, rare nudibranch). The guides were top notch- concerned, knowledgeable and friendly - and every dive of the ten we did was very different. Having dived a fair number of 'world class' sites, this was for me the best diving experience I have had and all within an hour's boat ride from the resort.We weren't crazy about the food, especially the dinners, which we found a little bland - perhaps a compromise to the family groups staying - and would have preferred Indonesian to Italian, but we certainly never went hungry. And do pay the extra for the A/C, as there are a lot of insects at night in the rainy season and the mosquito net on the bed is essential.The staff in the resort and the boat crews are brilliant, with good spoken English, and every small request was fulfilled right away with a smile. Planning to return in a few months..."

","Better than we imagined","We stayed a week at the resort in early November 2012. As others have noted the quality of service and the resort itself are of the highest standard. We are new divers and felt that we were very well catered for, despite the fact that the area is known to be a site better suited to experienced divers. The dive master Roberto took us under his wing and was very patient and understanding. We learnt so much from him and we now feel much more competent and confident as divers. All the staff were helpful and charming, and it is clear they love working at the resort. Even though the resort is on a remote island everything is comfortable and efforts are made to make the resort ecologically sustainable. Finally, as vegetarians we felt our needs were not just accommodated, but thoughtfully and creatively provided for. We will be back."

","Excellent diving, great food, wonderful staff","Just spent five days here. I expected it to be frugal and spartan. The accommodation is fine and the food is great. The resort is built on an arid island so everything has to be shipped in. The main cress always seemed to be chicken or fish but always done in interesting ways and really tasty. The diving is just superb. The resort is new and small, with a maximum capacity of some 25 guests. It was great to dive with four or five other people from a bat rather than the crowding we are used to in Egypt. The staff, Italian, Indonesian or other were uniformly helpful, pleasant and warm. We will definitely go back and recommend this place to other divers."

","Komodo Resort Is a Slice of Heaven","I have had extensive diving experience across Indonesia and place Komodo Resort on Sebayur Island at the top of places to stay. The bungalows are brilliantly designed to provide simple comforts like a great bed and pillows, plenty of power sockets, a mini bar fridge, a warm, fresh shower and of course, a million dollar view with the sounds of the waves lapping at the shore a few meters away. Cleanliness is priority. The resort is run with attentiveness, care and the utmost efficiency by owners, Stefano and Antonello who do everything to ensure your stay is perfect. They are also brilliant and safe dive guides with a supporting team headed by the vastly experienced and ever patient and smiling Laura. The diving is quite simply out of this world. It is one of the only places I know to use a foreign chef (Italian) which makes all the difference to a growling stomach after a day of diving, the food is healthy, delicious, diverse using locally sourced, organic ingredients or made fresh on the premises, this is most impressive. Nothing is too difficult and special requests are accommodated with a smile. The beer is cold and the wine fridge is stocked with a small but quality selection of wines which are priced to drink and enjoy, not to stare at and go,' wow that's expensive'...quite the contrary. I cannot recommend this remote, beautiful island highly enough, it is regularly booked out so book ahead."

","Best part of our honeymoon","Ordinarily, myself and my new husband are backpackers and don't have much experience of staying at more expensive resorts of this price and we were not sure what to expect in such a remote area. We were not disappointed!!!Our favourite parts of our 3 week honeymoon all across Indonesia all occurred here. Mine was when we first stepped off the resorts free transportation boat from Labuan Bajo. Firstly, I am not a fan of boat trips but their boat was the best I've ever experienced just because they have BEANBAG CHAIRS! it was so comfy to sit on the roof under the shades and nap on the way through the calm archipelago waters. Upon arrival we were given fresh cold towels on the pier to freshen up with before we were escorted to the restaurant - we thought we were awaiting our room keys etc but within minutes we were presented with a three course lunch the quality of which is indescribable. we didn't expect much for the food considering how remote the place is but it was excellent every time. every dinner was 5 courses including breads to start with, an appetiser, a main course, a pasta dish and then a pudding! Italian or local cuisine (try it all, it's all fantastic!). For my husband, the dives were the highlight of our trip. The family of owners are all experienced divers and snorkellers and know all the best spots. We took there package for half a days diving which included three spots, during which we saw sting rays, 5 huge manta rays, several giant turtles, sharks and all manner of fish and corals.The rooms were great and bathrooms finished perfectly. we did unfortunately get eaten alive by mosquitoes so be sure to tuck in the provided nets more tightly than we did! The island views are outstanding; yes its true as other reviewers state that the beaches are more coral than sand but this is to be expected of the majority of Indonesian beaches. The local staff are wonderful, speaking perfect English and also Italian, they were very friendly and charming. we also took the resorts trips to Kalong island to watch the bats fly their roost at sunset and the trip to Rinca island to see the dragons - both excellent. Thanks very much Komodo resort for a fabulous trip!"

The two italian owners are on the island themselves most of the time to make sure you have a once in a lifetime holiday.The divesites of komodo national park are as close as it gets. The diving is among the best I have ever done in my life. There is small stuff, big stuff, and the most beautiful coral that I have seen so far. There are strong and unpredictable currents but the dive-masters and the italian instructor laura take fantastic care of everyone. I can only highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to get away from it all, do diving in one of the best dive spots in the world, and enjoy a little bit of luxury in a friendly family atmosphere. pure barefoot luxury!"

","Komodo Resort and Diving Club","Just finished a 5 nite stay in this paradise. Best diving ever in 40 years. Best Italian food I have ever tasted and lots of it. Great Indonesian food too. We made friends with the ""United Nations"" guests and Italian and local staff rapidly. It just seemed like everyone was enjoying good karma. English is the common 2nd or 3rd language so everyone shares their adventures with each other. Really cool place on many levels. Great little snorkeling reef right in front of lodge. Outstanding local Dive Masters who balance safety with excitement. Be conservative here as the currents are often very strong and unusual - that's why the life is so vibrant but it complicates things too. Don't overestimate your abilities until you get a gradual exposure to the currents. Diving is European style so bring metric gauges and bone up on your hand signs and current techniques. (my lessons learned). The resort's gear looked brand new but I brought mine which they organized and cleaned everyday. Our main guide was Willy who just kept us cracked up as he SAFELY guided us through some amazing diving - just a cool guy. I would recommend Dive Masters Willy and Laura highly for new divers to Komodo. Saw all the fantastic things you go to Komodo for - very vibrant and diverse life on these reefs. Mantas by the dozens were literally everywhere on one dive. On other dives you saw sharks, turtles, amazing schools of fish, pristine healthy hard and soft corals, big and small stuff. We took the Komodo dragon trip to Rinca and the flying fox viewing boat trip - good non-diving activities. The weather was 100% fine every day (this is a very dry part of Indonesia) and seas were calm except obviously strong currents. The resort is new, remote and probably there are some glitches in long distance communications/international understanding but the staff is always around. ( I also found them to be very helpful and honest - one example - my wife lost her i phone/camera which they promptly found and returned to us as our flight prepared to leave !!!! ) I would recommend you spend some time and exchange several e-mails to clarify any concerns before going. I made an error in matching flight times from and to La Buan Bajo airport (disorganized and poorly secured airport IMHO) with the resort's free boat shuttle. I also wish I had planned on staying longer because Komodo Resort and Diving Club was a really wonderful addition to an already wonderful Bali trip.Glitches: The domestic airlines make it hard for international travelers to arrange flights to LaBuan Bajo from Bali or other parts of Indonesia via the internet. I had to do this by hand upon arrival in Bali so there was uncertainty until that point whether i could even get to Komodo ! Like all Indonesia there are bugs ( beds are netted) - bring DEET spray - and the sun can be intense. My wife and I carried extra water everywhere. Near Rinca some of the reefs at a snorkeling spot are damaged by years of anchoring - such places need tie up buoys. Litter near the town is disappointing, like other parts of Indonesia. Tobacco use is where USA was 40 years ago. Nonetheless..just go..it was wonderful.Paul G. California USA"

","Speechless!","My husband and I spent 6 days of our honeymoon in this beautiful place in September, and we are SO happy we did. Where do I start? From the moment we stepped on the Island and throughout our stay, we were received by a bunch of warm, gentle, funny and great staff. From the kitchen staff to the knowledgeable dive masters and boat crew, they are all really lovely people who make the experience very enjoyable. The owners are a couple of open, sympathetic and chilled our Italians who really do everything to make your stay a nice one. They are flexible and accommodating to the needs of their guests, and just good fun to hang out with. The bungalows are all simple yet stylish, the food is amazing and the diving is world class. The currents are strong, but as a relatively inexperienced diver (20 dives) I was able to enjoy the experience and feel safe thanks to great dive masters who know the area very well. We would recommend guests to stay at least a whole week in order to fully enjoy the Komodo national park, and because of the travel time. From our point of view, 10 days would have been perfect. We know now for next time. This place is perfect for open and laid back people who would like to discover the natural beauty of the Komodo islands first hand and relax. We had a fantastic time and will be back for sure!"

","Great hotel but MEAN management","We stayed here for 4 days last August.The hotel itself is really great (clean, confortable, beautiful...) offering excelent food (Indonesian for lunch, Italian for dinner) and great diving excursions and the island just like paradise. However the management philosophy makes you not feel so good.First of all be aware that, although you pay a high price (200 euros per night), every service/compliment is excluded and you have to pay an extra: 5 euros/day for snorkeling equipment, 3 euros/hour for kayak renting, 3 euros/hour for internet access, drinks on diving boat are not free either... In my opinion, this is a low-cost business philosofy but paying luxury prices which makes you feel robbed when you get the final invoice (expect surprises!!!).Moreover, the management staff is inflexible with the hotel rules. We asked to check out at 1pm (just 1 hour later!!) because our boat (for which the hotel charged us 1 million rupies for 4 people, more than twice the normal price!!) would pick us up at 1:30pm. Not only the answer was a big NO but they asked us to leave the room even earlier than 12:00 because other guests were coming!! Shouldn't the new guests wait if arriving early?? Just the question was annoying...We didn't like either seeing the owner yelling at the staff all the time.Regarding the beach, it is not very sandy but full of rocks and corals and with strong currents which makes it not very confortable for swimming. If you want to enjoy a good beach go to Bidadari instead, but Komodo Resort is much better for diving.The best: the beauty of the area, the food are the diving excursiones with very good master divers knowing all the good places in the area.Summarizing, the hotel is really good and if you don't care about money and you are willing to strictly respect their rules it is totally recommended. Otherwise I think there are other places to give a chance."

","Best location to dive the Komodo National Park","If you are planning on visiting this area to dive or see the dragons and do not want a week on a liveaboard then by choosing to stay here you will have made a great choice. We have just returned from a 12 night visit here and had a fantastic time. As has been said before the bungalows are of a great standard the mosquito nets could be a bit longer to stay tucked in as we did get bit a fair few times but thats my only gripe and I'm being fussy. The diving is world class but with strong currents at some sites they are best suited to experienced divers. The dive guides are great Willie is so knowledgeable, great at finding the unusual critters and a great guy, Al is a very kind man and great with the guests, Rama is fun and entusiastic but Laura could learn to smile a bit more and be a bit more welcoming and remember that people have spent a lot to be here. What really makes this place so SPECIAL though for me are the local staff who are so charming, gentle and courteous. A big thank you to all of them but particularly Alex ( Lexi) and 'Chef' for coping with our special meal requests!"

Did my open water and two adventure dives with Laura - great instructor and very, very comfortable to dive with. The other divers on staff - Al, Rama and Willie were all great. The bungalows are very nice, the food is out of this world, especially with being on a remote island... The owners really seem to care that the guests are enjoying themselves. Hotel staff is very friendly and accomodating. The boat trips are really fantastic as well. I can't wait to go back! Take the ten minute walk up the hill at sunset - amazing views."

","Paradise, peace and proximity","Bit of a journey getting to Labuan Bajo, then an unfortunate hiccup with the airport transfer—no one there to greet us at the plane, our only real complaint —but once we were checked in and sitting on board the hour-long boat to Sebayur, reclined in giant bean-bags, watching the amazing sunset, we got the feeling that everything was going to be just fine… and it was…This is a stunning desert island resort located just outside the boundary of Komodo National Park. I don’t really want to know how they got permission to build so close but as long as they continue to keep the waste under control, as a happy customer, I’m glad they did. The logistical advantage to staying here is waking up an hour closer to the fabulous dive sites and dragons, instead of having to “commute” from Labuan Bajo. Also, since neither my wife nor myself are divers and I tend toward crippling sea-sickness, this was a much better option for us than joining one of the many live-aboards plying the region.The cabins are simple, clean, functional, stylish A-frame huts with picture windows overlooking a private white-sand beach and a small deserted island a couple hundred yards off shore. The rooms have large beds, ample mosquito nets, wet-room-style bathrooms, Western toilets (which you’re asked to flush with provided salt water when possible), small desk, convenient and fairly-priced mini-bar fridge, fans— and air-con on the deluxe cabins, where we stayed. Think we could have done fine without the air-con given it was breezy but it was nice to occasionally cool the room down before bed. Each room also has a porch with more of those comfy bean-bags—a great place to unwind, grab some shade or enjoy the night sky so far from civilization. (here my wife insists I mention the fabulous, anomalous, stylish, swiveling, Italian leather desk chair which was as surprising to find as it was superb)This is a truly remote resort—even the water has to be boated in and pumped into storage tanks so conservation principles are a must. Still, we never wanted for showers or drinking water and it was easy enough to rinse our gear. The food is tasty and filling with generally Indonesian fare for lunch and a three course slap-up Italian feast for dinner. Given the location, it was amusing and impressive to see how seriously the Italian owners take their food: I mean, fish tartare for starters, a course of homemade pasta, some local fish or tender chicken with garden vegetables then a choice of fresh fruit, crème brulee or panna cotta for dessert? Nice. Each lunchtime, the lovely, efficient and on-the-case restaurant manager Helen would present you with two choices for each course for dinner. It might be a bit hard to go completely vegetarian but the chefs seemed eager to please. Breakfast was a generally bland but filling affair though the Flores coffee was strong as oak, thick as mud, and very much appreciated. The only real downside to our mealtime was a certain large, rude, loud and demanding American family group— though I’m grateful to the dive staff for always putting these people on a separate boat— they really do aim to please…As a borderline obsessional snorkeller (check the bio, if interested) I can rate the “house reef” here as: pretty darn good. There’s also the bonus availability and reefs of the uninhabited island offshore where the staff are happy to drop you by speedboat (thirty second ride) with a book, a towel, some water and your snorkel gear—just wave your fins above your head and they come back and get you, easy. (Sidenote: this island also appeared to be where the No Roads kayak “expeditions” stop for camping and I gotta say-- personally, I’d be extremely disappointed after kayaking all day at huge expense to look up from my tent and see the smart, well-appointed chalets of Komodo Resort and Diving Club glittering across the narrow channel. I mean, what if you smell the fresh foccacia?)In the water: lots of healthy corals teeming with colorful reef fish though the big stuff is mostly to be found further afield. To that end, accompanying the dive boats around the national park was top rate and we had some absolutely epic snorkels in many varied topographies. Rays, copious turtles, sharks, giant cuttlefish, incredible coral formations, more angelfish species than I’ve ever seen in one place— not to mention the reasonably priced (35 euros pp) all-day trip to see the dragons on nearby Rinca, including lunch and two snorkels. The dive boat staff were very professional and kept a close eye on both divers and snorkellers—no small feat given the wind-chop, ferocious currents and even the occasional whirlpool. I can’t say enough about the shaded rooftop bean-bag lounge scene on top of all the boats, or the rocket-fuel coffee provided. The only minor let down was the excursion to see the flying foxes—an hour and a half each way to see (okay, there were thousands) of blurry brown blobs winging through the fading twilight.All told we spent an idyllic week here, very laid back and quite a bit of fun. The prices are fair, the food is great and the staff were wonderful. Guests while we were there were a mix of Italians, Indonesians, Brits, Americans and, aside from the aforementioned families who made me ashamed of my species, very quiet and welcoming.Final bits and bobs: there is some construction of new chalets going on but it isn't noisy or seem excessive; unless you bring cash, bills need to be paid at the office in Labuan Bajo at the end of your stay. The island had patchy mobile reception, though we never tried to use the wifi. Questions put to the website were answered promptly and informatively, just loved hanging out here really, quite bit sad to leave. Would love to return. Recommended."

","Lovely place, beautiful food, great diving","We loved this place! The cottages are actually better than they appear in the photos, the food is to die for and the diving extra special. We went with Laura to Batu Bulong and Manta Point for two extraordinary dives, followed by a memorable night dive just around the corner at the Mini Wall. They also take care to offer you wonderful opportunities to see the Komodos and the flying foxes, as well as helping us organise our internal flights, meeting us at the airport and getting us back to the plane at the end. We found the staff extremely attentive, friendly and hospitable. Gaye had not warned them she is a vegetarian and yet within an hour of our arrival the chef had whipped up a wonderful lunch for her, and all her subsequent meals were imaginative, tasty and fresh. The four course meals were something else! Don't miss the house reef, right at your front door, either. A few steps and you can snorkel some very healthy coral which is full of life - we saw turtles every day. Highly recommended and filling up fast!"

","AMAZING!!! Stunning location and amazing hospitality!","So this is the first time i've left a review on here, but after spending four days in paradise i thought it was about time i wrote one!!Me and my girlfriend stumbled across this place back in May whilst in Komodo and Flores. We initially booked a two night stay, but after arriving at the resort we decided to re-arrange our plans and stay an extra two nights....... if we had more time, we would have stayed much longer! The island itself is beautiful and in an ideal location for diving and Komodo trips! We don't dive ourselves but we did spend two days snorkeling whilst others dived. The boat and crew were fantastic and the snorkeling was by far the best we've ever done..... we were extremely jealous of the divers and have now decided it's time to get certified! The accommodation was very nice and just as it is in the pictures! The restaurant was also very nice and the food is definitely some of the best we've had since been in Indonesia, and we've been here for over a year! Everything is made fresh and it is a combination of Italian and Indonesian cuisine with plenty of fresh fish. The food is another real selling point of this place!The staff at this place are also amazing. Indonesia can often be a frustrating place to be but the service here was brilliant and very refreshing! The staff were very friendly and helpful and the owners were incredibly hospitable! They looked after us from the moment we were picked up and also helped us to arrange onward flights and provided us with a wealth of knowledge about the area. BY FAR the best hospitality we've received in Indonesia if not anywhere!I really can not recommend this place enough, a stunning location and FANTASTIC value for money! We will definitely be returning!!"

The staffs (Stefano, Laura, Flavia, Willy & Alim) are nice and friendly even though some of them could use some more training. I appreciate their efforts to maintain the ocean by cleaning up the beach from plastic waste in the afternoon, when the water is low. I also took my PADI diving certificate here. It was a private course with Laura. The ""pool"" training part of the course was conducted on a shallow pristine water with school of fishes around me. With Laura's extra patience, I was able to face my fear of deep water. Thank you, everyone!"

I cannot speak highly enough about the experience and level of service offered. I looked at a number of other companies in Labaun Bojo and settled on Komodo Resort due to their friendly staff and organised nature of the information provided. Prices are pretty much the same across all the shops at $80 for 2 dives. I found the staff professional and all diversion the boat well looked after, no matter the level of experience. Willie the divemaster was very knowledgable and had an amazing ability to spot things underwater...truly genius.

","Paradise found!","Surely one of the better dive and beach resorts we ever visited in Indonesia. Imagine this: take one of the most beautifull marine parks in Indonesia, with hundreds of uninhabited islands, mix in some of the best dive sites and snorkling in Indonesia. Then build a 4 star resort on the fringe of that marine park, add an Italian chef, a great dive instructor and a heap of friendly local staff...that's paradise right there. We traveled with 3 small kids and although the resort does not specifically cater to kids, they had a great time on the beach and snorkling. The boat trip from Labuan Bajo takes about 1 hr and from the resort you can organize day trips to see the Komodo Dragons. We went to Rinca island for that and it was a great experience. Did I mention the rooms are great and that they have 24h electricity and hot running water (which still is a luxury in this part of Indonesia). The owner plans to increase room prices significantly from May, when the resort will be finished (they are still adding a few bungalows), and aims for the European market for scuba holidays. It still will be a great place for independent travelers and if you manage to get there before May, its great value too!"

","Island paradise","After a lot of searching, we stumbled upon this wonderful resort through a recommendation. We went to Komodo for the dragons and some diving and left with a longing to go back. A lot of it was because of the hospitality and care we received here. The resort is brand new on an uninhabited island right outside Komodo National Park. Lot of great dive sites are only within an hour whereas they'd take twice as long to come to and from Labuanbajo. Dive equipment is also all new, the resort is PADI-affiliated, bungalows are all sea-facing and airy, good food (homemade pasta, jams, fresh vegetables, etc.) and service! Stefano, who built the place from nothing, knows the area and Indonesia very well and took a lot of care to ensure our safety during dives. We had time for only two dives and the Manta point is simply superb. The corals too are healthy and lovely to see. The dragons are a day trip and the snorkeling is also very good, we were told. We initially wondered if we'd get bored with nothing else to do on the island but you are pretty tired by the end of the day and after a wonderful meal, you are pretty much ready to crash. And the quiet was great to truly unwind and relax. Would highly recommend!"

They don't have villas at all even though our booking clearly stated that we would be in a villa - and the price we paid was well beyond a regular hotel room. There was one chair in the room. The pool was filthy and completely unusable. On our last day there, it was looking a bit better. The pool has about 8 lounge chairs and 6 well worn beach towels. The chairs do not have cushions. The beach is unusable except for walking. The beer is outrageously overpriced - double what we paid in nice restaurants. We only ate breakfast there since it was included. The menu is really overpriced. The wifi never worked in the restaurant/lounge and only worked in one section of the lobby.

","Not the best","So this is mediocre to mediocre/poor tourist hotel that although only a few years old is starting to show signs of wear and tear.Located 5 minutes out of the busy (and noisy) little port of Labuan Bajo there is nothing else around. No shops, no restaurants - nothing at all.We preferred staying out of the port - where the hostels and hotels looked pretty grim and we did not regret that choice. The hotel has a shuttle that is free from 7am to 8pm for going into the port and coming back. It is available at a cost at other times.The real issue here is the unusual design of the building(s). The main building is furthest from the water with two 'villas' next and then a open air gazebo type structure nearest the beach and the pool. If you dont stay in the 'villas' then you will not have any view at all. If it rains then you will get soaked getting from your room (whether a 'Villa' or not) to the 'restaurant.'I use the term restaurant loosely. It serves really really bad food - by any standard. They take forever to cook it. For instance, chicken wings took 90 minutes to come out. They then take forever to give you the bill. We spent 35 minutes waiting for a bill!The hotel is on a beach but if you are thinking sparkling clear blue water then guess again. While not actually that bad it wasnt the sort of beach you would recommend to someone.We liked:- the room. It was ok for size without being large.- the room was clean- pillows and bed were great- the shower had 'real' hot water- the location with its own beach.- staff were quite friendly.We found this to be not so good- the food. Really terrible - and guess what - a service charge of 21% on what is already overpriced food. I noticed that no local tourists ate at the hotel restaurant. They obviously knew better.- Wifi. At best you could say serviceable. Other times you get nothing.- tv is very old and small- the bathroom smells. Like all the time.- the price. I would say it was 25% overpriced for what it offered.- the staff were clueless as to local attractions."

","Mediocre place","I was not thrilled by this hotel. Our travel agent in Flores changed our hotel one week before our arrival in Flores so we ended up coming here. There two types of rooms: rooms that have sea view( nothing really exciting) and room in the main building that don't have balconies and have view the rooms that actually have a sea view. Breakfast was minimal and there were flies all over the place. The hotel staff somewhat indifferent. The only positive thing about this hotel was the clean room. Would I go back there? NO!"

","Nice & comfy","Totally worth of stay after a whole week on a road trip. It's clean. If you had spare of money, get the villa to get the sea view. Otherwise choose the deluxe and request for the middle to get the view as well. Mine was 206, and got good view.Hang out at its restaurant during the sunset. It's gorgeous.The beach is clean but the water is not clear, so not too tempting to swim in.Good value for sure."

","Modern comfortable rooms in an average (but potentially great) setting","We stayed here on two single night occasions during our holiday in Flores.It was comfortable and modern, but we felt the place lacked soul.The design of the buildings has not maximised the space available, and most rooms do not have uninterrupted sea views, as you would hope in this region. Just doesn't seem to be well thought out.The gardens were nice and tidy and enjoyable, with good birds visiting.We enjoyed the pool and the restaurant area. Staff were very attentive and meals nicely served. Breakfast was included and generous.The beach area needs some work, and certainly is not a swimming beach, as it is dirty and shallow. Quite good for shore bird watching however.Like many areas in Flores there is a bad rubbish problem and it seems that from the Hotels point of view it is not their problem. But it is your problem! So don't leave it to guests like us to pick up the beach rubbish, which we always do when we can.Walking along the beach reveals a mixed bag of other hotels and restaurants, most looking after their own little space. Development has been a bit haphazard and hopefully this improves over the next few years."

","Very pleasant and relaxing","I spent one night in a villa at the Luwansa Beach Resort as part of a visit to Komodo National Park. I did not book the hotel directly--it was part of a package that included transportation and a guide for visiting the park.Check-in was simple and quick. The lobby, which is the only part of the hotel with wifi, has a comfortable seating area with tables for socializing and using the wifi (which is very slow and useful for checking email and confirming travel arrangements, but little else).My villa was exquisite. I had a huge, comfortable king size bed and a nice size desk. The bathroom was large and well appointed, and the towels were nice and fluffy.I had dinner at the restaurant, which overlooks the beach. It's a lovely place to watch the sunset. I had an excellent meal that was expensive by local standards but still very reasonable. Service was unrushed but responsive. I also had the complimentary breakfast buffet, which was very nice and offered plenty of good options.I wish I'd planned a longer stay. This place was wonderful."

It is free and will take you where you want to go. The staff are lovely and helpful with just enough English. Nothing seems too much bother. The beach lights up at sunset. Wifi is poor and was virtually non-existent while I was there due to ""electricty down"" there is Wifi at reception. The telephone lines were down too during my visit so I was unable to phone for an airport pickup. The shower was good and hot. The bed was clean and comfortable, toiletries,safe and fridge were provided. I was given an upgrade so the room and especially the bathroom were large and roomy. There was a flatscreen TV but only a couple of English channels. The grounds of the hotel are lovely, there are hardly any sunbeds for sun worshippers, and the beach is at you doorstep."

","loved it!","As Labuanbajo was our starting/ending point for all the tours we did all around Flores we stayed every now and then for a night or two at Luwansa Beach Resort. In total we stayed 7 nights. We liked the hotel very much. Spacious and clean rooms with a/c, very friendly and helpful staff, nice breakfast buffet, nice pool. On the first night we had dinner at the hotel which was pretty expensive and unfortunately rather european spicy. As we liked the authentic indonesian spicy and hot food better we went to the fish market every night. With the free shuttle to town no problem at all. The Wifi is slow as everywhere else in Flores and only available in the Lobby but that didn't bother us as we were on vacation. Would definitely stay here again."

Rooms are very clean, comfortable, and well-equipped. Very good quality for the price. Cons: pool maintenance is lacking, wifi only really works in the lobby, food is overpriced, and staff/management seem a bit unorganized (we had some issues/discrepancies with our bill while checking out)Overall, I would (and did) recommend to other travelers staying in the area."

","Great little place","This hotel appeared to be one of the nicer ones in Labuan without being expensive. You really do get value for money here. I paid £20 a night for the room and breakfast (buffet). The rooms were clean and spacious, no balconies but large windows. Wifi is only available in the foyer and it was very VERY slow. That said, the foyer did become a very social place where all the guest congregated to use the Internet. Staff service is good but SLOW. Indonesian island time at its best. So don't expect anything to happen straight away when u ask. But it will get done eventually. This hotel is situated out of the town centre. But They offer a free shuttle bus into town that stops at 8pm or u can hire a bike or get a taxi. It's all cheap.Breakfast is simple but nice. Omelette are good. The pool is lovely but it's not cleaned regularly. If u want it cleaned out all u need to do is ask.The hotel is on the beach but it's not a pleasant one. It's dirty with rubbish and plastic everywhere but u do get to see a cracking sunset! All in all its good value for money. I had a very relaxing stay here. The town itself is just a small port town but it has a cracking fish night market and find good restaurants! Good for a rest before your next stop!"

However the air conditioner works well and the TV has many channels local and international (well, at least they have National Geographic).Breakfast by the sea is pretty nice and the menu is quite excellent from fried rice, bacon, pancakes, cereals.Shuttle bus is also perfect, you just need to wait sometimes but still helps a lot to take me to the town."

","Good choice for Labuan Bajo","Spent one night here and pleasantly surprised by the standard of the hotel. Rooms are a good size with comfortable bed and pillows. The shower was great and basic bathroom accessories were supplied which is unusual for Flores. Wifi in the rooms was poor but lobby and restaurant was a bit stronger. Strangely there are no balconies which was disappointing and meant that you didn't want to stay in the room for long. The pool was a highlight, right on the beach and umbrellas if you need some shade. being a little out of town we decided to eat at the restaurant.

","Good resort with limits","This ""resort"" is a useful starting point to discover wonderful Flores. But no purpose in booking a longer stay - a real ""resort"", i.e. a stand-alone hotel (with all facilities for at least a few days) should be different.Positive: friendly, patient and helpful staff. Great view from the breakfast table in the garden onto the Sea. Free airport transfer. Nice, simple and clean architecture and well-kept property. Pool clean, rather small.On the downside: 1. the beach is terribly dirty!!! Disgusting amounts of plastic bottles, cans, rotten fish... at the time of my visit. 2. no internet in the rooms (they say this will change). My room rate did not include breakfast - a bad idea, as there is no alternative outside."

","Exceeding our expectations!","We book a night stay through agoda. It was surprisingly new and clean! It was approximately 10 mins drive from the habour to the resort. The room was well equipped with the necessary amenities that we required. One thing they could further improved was to strenthen the WiFi signal for rooms located near the end of the corridor. We had to walk down to the lobby just to gain access to decent WiFi connection.It's great they provide complimentary pick up and transfer services from 7am to 8 pm. We did pay for our transfer as our flight was early in the morning, the price was affordable it was just that the driver did not bring along any change for the bill I gave him and he wanted me to walk OUT of the airport to a nearby resort to get the change for him. I thought it would be easier for him to ask around the airport since he is a local and it would be easier for him to communicate with the airport's staff for the change. I would still recommend this resort and perhaps the resort's management could look into further enriching the staffs' service quality."

","One of the best hotels in Labuan","We have spent 4 days in Labuan Bajo for scuba diving and compared to my previous accommodations in Labuan Bajo this is by far one of the best options in town. The hotel opened three years ago and during our stay they were celebrating their anniversary. We got a very warm welcome and were invited to their festivity and the hospitality was superb during our whole stay.In general you have to bear in mind that Labuan Bajo is not yet on the same level as the main tourist destinations in Indonesia (e.g. Bali) therefore you should not expect the same service or amenities as in a Sheraton or Four Seasons (so please do not complain about their service or breakfast). The staff is always doing their best to offer a great service.Positive:- large and clean rooms with good AC. The room comes with a nice sea-view, a large bathroom, a safe and a fridge.- Free shuttle service to the town from 7am to 8pm incl. free pick-up from the airport. We used this service every day to get to our dive center.- nice pool area- friendly service- good breakfast incl. egg-station, warm dishes, toast and fruitsRoom for improvement:- Free WIFI is extremely slow in the rooms but most of the time available"

","Average hotel, but bad experience with island tour","Hi, we stayed at Luwansa from 8-12 June and had one of the most unforgettable experiences.. and not in a good way. We booked the Rinca Villa which was average at best. It looks just any other deluxe room. It did overlook the beach so sunset was a nice experience. Everything else was basic and average. The food wasn't amazing. We booked our island tour (Komodo Island, Pink Beach and Rinca Island) through the hotel manager on the first day. Not only was it overpriced, halfway thru the tour our sailboat died and we were stuck in the open sea with choppy waters for 4 hours. Our tour guide (who was also the hotel security guide) contacted the hotel manager who in turn contacted the ""military"". This ""military commander"" found us after 4 hours in a speedboat and asked that we pay IDR2 mil for the fuel for his speedboat (IDR3 mil had to be paid by the hotel side apparently). So not only did we not not finish the tour and not get a refund, we had to pay extra for something that we did not ask for. And because of this, the hotel experience left a very bitter taste in our mouths. We would go back to Flores and Labuan Bajo in a heartbeat, but definitely will not stay in this hotel again."

","Poor Service","Luwansa is located at some 10 mins away from Labuan Bajo center so the shuttle offered by the hotel is very useful. However, the shuttle is available only up to 8 in the night. Considering the bad food provided in the hotel restaurant we ate out all the nights we were there and had to either hurry up with our dinner or pay extra for the shuttle to take us back to the hotel. Breakfast at the restaurant way below average.We first had the room on the ground floor and requested to shift to the first floor so that we had a sea view rather than a garden view. The beach is right in front of the hotel so the location is good. The room is large and clean - same with the bathroom on the first floor. Ground floor bathroom was a bit gloomy. Service is poor - considering the standard of Bali hotels. We had to lug our bags between rooms ourselves, had to figure out where the ac remote was hidden/kept, had to figure out how the door to the balcony opened (it was jammed), had to figure out how the safe worked (it had a problem) etc....We ended up calling the staff over for each of these annoyances which would have been avoided if someone had brought us to our room when we checked in and given us an intro to where all things were. Something that's done at every hotel normally.Place is run down a bit. Like someone else said it before - the choices in Labuan Bajo aren't many and this did ok for a night or two."

","Good, if a little rough around the edges","I struggled with what rating to give Luwansa. In another location I'd probably have gone with 3 stars, but in Labuan Bajo your options are limited and Luwansa ticks a lot of boxes. It is out of town, situated on a quiet beach. It has a lovely swimming pool. The rooms are clean and perfectly adequate for a short stay. And, above all, the staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful. On the flip side, the food is below average - this is even more a shame when you factor that the hotel is away from town so you thus have to get out to get fed, but it is also a shame because the Luwansa has a much better location than most of the restaurants in town. Furthermore, although the hotel offers a free shuttle, which at least ensures your access to town, this is not operated in a logical way, and thus you can often find yourself waiting long stretches or being delayed by other guests. Having said all of this, as said, the Luwansa will offer you a simple but satisfactory experience and with all the fantastic diving on offer in Komodo National Park, you aren't likely to be staying much at the hotel anyway!"

","Great spot, right on the beach.","Arrived in Labuan Bajo a few days earlier than planned. Luwansa photos looked good, so booked 3 nights in a deluxe room. Checkin was quick and very efficientand we were given an upgrade to a villa with ocean views. Even better. Room was large, very well setup, comfortable bed witha a tiny balcony with amazing views. Pool was great. Restaurant right on the beach was so good, we ate dinner there three times. First night, noticed sand flies were very friendly, so used a repellant thereafter.Only downside was the 5 km to Labuan Bajo, but the free shuttle worked fine. Staff all very friendly and efficient, breakfasts very good. Would recommend for a relaxing time away from it all."

","Good but not great","This beach resort, like so many places I have stayed which have ‘beach resort’ in their name, whilst being on a beach, is not on a particularly nice stretch of beach … it’s not on what I would call sand, but more like dirt, and it does not look appetising to swim. However, that aside, it has beautiful views of the ocean and sunsets, and a nice (although slightly small) swimming pool overlooking the ocean. The grounds are very nice and well kept, and the rooms are large and airconditioned. However, it seems the hotel (or likely the town itself) is still new to the hotel trade and learning – the staff at check-in and the pool bar weren’t particular helpful or of service, and the rooms were missing a few creature comforts, and the food wasn’t particularly great – that aside however it was a comfortable stay, and they do offer a shuttle service to the town, which is very handy given it’s quite a ways from the main strip (not walking distance)."

Also free airport pick up and drop off.May be good to improve on...- the food is ok - the nasi goreng and juices are great but the rest of the menu is average.

","Clean, friendly hotel with pool and free shuttle into LBJ","We stayed here twice so we must have liked it. The staff fall over themselves to help out and are uber friendly. The rooms are a generous size with all the usual Western standards of facilities. The hot water showers are a real treat and the TV shows Fox movies for those 'can't be bothered to go into town' evenings. The hotel operate a free shuttle to and from town. It's handy if you take the phone number to call for a pick-up from LBJ. Other hotels charge lots for this so I know it's a big plus. LBJ's not somewhere you want to linger for more than a couple of days! The hotel pool is small but perfectly formed and clean. Enough sun loungers to go round plus free pool towels. Don't expect to frolic on the beach out front however; LBJ isn't famous for its clean beaches. But the viewpoint's lovely and the restaurant (just breakfasts) is right on the beach. Good food too and not too expensive considering. Stock up on your favourites in town for next to nothing and put it in the room fridge which is standard across the board. We paid 640,000 IDR booking online (which was good value) but when we went to rebook with them here in person, they gave us the same room for 500,000IDR! Lesson learned. And they've got stacks of rooms here so if you can wait to book in person, do so. I'd definitely stay here again. And we stayed at an upmarket homestay on the hill and a budget homestay centrally in LBJ when we were here last year so have knowledge of other accomm here. My advice would be: splash out a bit more and come here; you won't regret it."

","Recommended when you are in Labun Bajo","I stayed here one night during my Komodo Island Diving & Hiking trip recently. The place representation was ok, nothing to complain about and the staff was very friendly & very helpful.Location wise - everyplace is around 10 mins from any points in the city. It's not a big city. About 5 mins from Luwansa there is this club, a much scaledown Bali ""Potatohead"", called Atlantis. You can walk by the beach and get there in a zap.There are 2 other hotels around the one that i stayed in, about the same rate and looked nice also. On the way back home from the sea, we had a chance to stop by Luwansa hotel again to get a fresh shower before heading back to the airport ... (Again, around 10 minutes from the hotel)"

A bit of disadvantage is the bar/restaurant next to the beach - it is hot there, especially when there is no wind (couple of fans would solve the problem). Reasonable choice of good quality food. All in all well managed hotel with Indonesian flavor of relaxed approach."

","Trying hard but some ways to go","This place is fine to stay at - just be patient and flexible as there will be inevitably be some kinks. It like the staff are trying really hard but the systems they have are just not up to par. Wireless internet only works in the lobby area. The beach is not great, there's a lot of trash. It best to use the hotel as a base and then go exploring. The free shuttle is a good service during the day - after 8 pm there is a charge to go into town which is the same as a taxi fare. We thought we had booked a villa but it actually wasn't a separate villa at all - it was a room in a separate building, so we were a little confused by that. Beds are big and comfortable and you will appreciate them after spending a few days on a boat. The hotel doesn't make any arrangements for snorkeling trips, etc.- best to go into town and talk to different dive companies so you can compare prices"

","Average rooms and nice pool area","Hotel located outside Labuanbajo, around 5 minutes by car. We stayed in a hotel room, not a villa, not spacious rooms, bad ventilation in the bathroom as water is not properly drained leading to humidity. Best part is the pool and the restaurant both by the beach. Restaurant is overpriced, food is not bad and service is slow. Not a bad option but mai not because of lack of competitors rather than for its quality."

","beautiful Luwansa","Just spent 6 days there. A great hotel with wonderful gardens and stunning clean pool meters from the beach looking out to the islands. A large coffee bar with great views was used for breakfast and evening meal during the off season. A great time to be there in March as fairly quiet. Met some wonderful people from Holland, Germany, Netherlands, Canada and Australia. The rooms are being refurbished so they were clean and well serviced. Good size and are serviced each day if you wish. Big shower, very efficient aircon. Small bar fridge. The villas have great ocean views. The staff very friendly with reasonable English. There is a free shuttle service and the driver we had had good local knowledge of shops, restaurants etc and where to get the best fresh seafood which you can buy and take back to have cooked by the chef.(Don't know about the peak season). the food overall was delicious. In regards to day or overnight trips there are dozens of operator to chose from. We managed to save AUD$50 per trip by dealing direct with the boat operators but you need to speak Indonesian or know someone who does. A very enjoyable stay and will return."

","One of Labuan Bajo's Best","I was on a motorcycle touring trip around the East Indonesian islands and stayed for one night at the Luwansa Beach Hotel. I didn't have any reservation with the hotel and arrived at midnight as a walk-in guest. It was Christmas day and most people at Labuan Bajo celebrate Christmas, including hotel staffs. Many of them were on leave.Surprising to me, I was greeted with a warm welcome by the security guard that guide me to the front office. The night shift front office staff was very good, informative and work swiftly to give me a very nice, clean and cozy superior room with a very unexpected cheap price! During that holiday trip, the one night stay at Luwansa was the best accommodation that I had which really released me from tiredness on the road. The hotel is very nicely setup, clean and friendly. Although I didn't have a chance to go to the beach, I can feel that it will be an excellent experience."

","3 nights of rest","Situated on a very remote beach about 10 minutes drive out of town - it's the perfect place to do lots of nothing! It was a great start to our holiday and really helped us unwind! Our room was large and clean and the pool area was beautiful. The only negative was the lunch service down in the beach front restaurant was a little bit unpredictable - with many menu options unavailable. But what we did eat was always fine! I think 3 nights was perfect, any more and I think we would have started to get a little restless because there is NOTHING to do nearby. That said, we did make use of the free transfer bus into town a few times - and that was very convenient."

The free shuttle bus saved us a lot in cab fares, and the drivers (as with all the staff) were very helpful.  The downside is that they charge a 21% government tax, which does not exist.

","Nice beach location, great pool","The hotel is new and build in a nice garden right on the beach. The rooms are clean, and spacious but some of the details were not thought out (we had a nice shower in the bathroom, but is came from a hole in the roof and the piping to it was partially stainless steel and partially green plastic). What was also a disappointment was that the Villa's are actually a two story building a bit away from the main building. The rooms there had neither veranda or balcony. The WiFi only works in the reception area and is pretty slow. The hotel restaurant has a nice menu, but many of the dishes listed were not available. As the hotel is about 5 km out of town and there are not many taxi's, you will almost have to eat there.On arrival our complementary driver had already left because the plane was delayed by about 45 minutes (which I think he could have known) so we had to pay for a taxi to get us to the hotel. We were charged IDR 100.000 for making a trip into town, but no offer was mad to reimburse our taxi costs coming in.All in all, the hotel is not bad, but many of the details should be improved to take it to the next level."

","Close to perfection","I have been staying in Luwansa resort, LabuanBajo several times in the last 6 months, most of the time in one of the great front-sea 'villas' rooms, after trying other places in town. I've been coming in solo, or with friends, and I have recommended the place to many people travelling in Flores, some I later met a second time here, all very happy for the tip.First, the staff and the manager always smile, do their best to help you in many ways. You feel welcome from the first minute to the last. They can also help you with trips, massages, tours. Just ask. Second, the place is just gorgeous: from the wide open-air reception area to the corridors, to the wide manicured gardens, the pool, the clean beach (it's unusual in Flores), the Komodo outside bar opened all day, and the rooms themselves.Third, the services are unusually good for LabuanBajo, and getting better (good Wi-Fi at the bar, and beginning in the rooms). Laundry is fast and perfect, room cleaning and service excellent, free shuttle almost anytime to and from the city center or the airport.The big buffet breakfast from 6-7 to 10 at the bar by the beach is also not to miss. You understand while you're here that you're in a place where people do their best for the guests. And, by reading the commentaries here on trip advisor I understand that things got better and better recently, which is certainly nothing always easy in LabuanBajo. This hotel is a perfect place to use as a resort (pool, bar, beach with a fabulous sunset..), or as a quiet, safe and clean place to rest before or after a trek in the Manggarai country or a boat trip from Lombok or else, for families (large connecting rooms by the garden), or for a honeymoon."

Our original room stank of cigarette smoke and the staff seemed nonplussed when we said this was unacceptable.Secondly the bar was low on most spirits despite them being on the menu.But the room we were moved to was fantastic; with a huge and very modern bathroom.Better still, the pool/bar area was lovely and then spectacular at sunset with views of the Komodo islands and dinner was really tasty as well. Plus the bill was reasonable and the free pick up was air-conditioned and comfortable.Would strongly recommend it; the best place we stayed in in Indonesia."

The pool is very small and for the entire hotel they only had 5 deck chairs at the pool and none at the beach! Sunsets from the pool however are wonderful. The restaurant was ok but not great with slow service. Breakfast was poor with most of the hot items not properly heated and cold. Flies were everywhere. The hotel shuttle to town was convenient but sometimes we had to wait a long time for a pick up. The staff were generally friendly and helpful.

","Disappointed...","First the positive: The hotelroom was nice, clean and modern. The hotel has a beach with (murky) waters, a swimming pool, a beach cafe and (slow) WiFi in the lobby. Beautiful view of sunset. The negative: The hotel is located 40 min walk from the center of town and there is no resturants etc. around the hotel. They advertise with free transport, but that is unreliable. I arranged to be picked up at 6 pm. After waiting by the road for 40 min I got Perama Tour&travel to call the hotel, the hotel told me to wait another half an hour. The same thing happened the next day?! As a solo female traveler I really did not like sitting by the road and have every taxi, bemo and ojek hunking at me. But the hoteldriver was nice, probably just overworked. I guess when you are just one person you are not a priority..

Didn't come back either. When asked about it later, they told us that the driver had asked at the restaurant if they had any guests from Luwansa, they had said no and the driver had left.

","Great staff","We arrived in Labuan Bajo at a busy time and were booked into the Luwansa after another hotel had double booked us. Unfortunately the Luwansa could only give us a room for one night. We struck problems with ongoing travel arrangements and booking further accommodation. The receptionist Selvi Sadur was fantastic, she ended up sorting out further accommodation as well as flight tickets through the local agency. Her English was excellent and she very patient, as was the driver 'Bony' who took us to the airline office. The hotel was clean, lovely pool, ocean views and polite and smiling staff."

","Great pool and beachfront bar, an over-budget treat","We made the mistake of not booking our chosen accommodation in Labuan Bajo (we tried, but wifi and mobile phone problems prevented us), and were really disappointed to find it full. We'd promised the children a hotel with a swimming pool at the end of our 17 hour bus and 8 hour ferry journey, which is how we ended up spending more than we planned on a bit of an over-budget treat.We were offered a standard or a luxury room; as a family of 5 we opted for the larger luxury room and found it very spacious and indeed luxurious! Now, as budget travellers, you have to bear in mind that we've not stayed in many 'posh hotels' so you may not be quite so impressed, but we absolutely loved the endless supply of soft, fluffy towels, the rainshower, the separate toilet cubicle (possibly the only toilet seat we had in the whole of Indonesia that didn't get soaked by the shower) and the view of the garden and pool.My husband went diving, so I was left to entertain the children, which was easy as all they wanted to do was swim in the pool. There are many sun loungers & umbrellas and the pool is right by the beach, so you can have a lovely view while you relax. There is cold beer available from the restaurant, where the food is pretty good too.The hotel is a little out of town, but there is a free driver service. You just call him and get picked up, or arrange a time to meet. He was always there on time, and drove safely in a big car with seat belts. It's about 5 mins drive to town. There are many, many nice places to eat in town, including a big street food market for cheap eats, right up to high-end Italian food at European prices. We tried both, and found them equally charming in their own ways.We had to pay extra for breakfast as there were 5 of us sharing a room that is really for 2 people, but it was worth it. Most days it was buffet style and there was REAL bacon (wow!), eggs cooked how you want, and the usual selection of juice, tea, coffee & toast etc. It would have been nice to have some more vegetables e.g. tomatoes with the cooked breakfast, and the fruit selection was very basic and the same every day. However, we were full enough to only need 1 more meal in the evening, so it was good value! Some days, when we were the only guests, it was a la carte, but you still got a huge selection, but it was quite slow to arrive.The TV was often on in the restaurant, which we found annoying, but as we were often the only guests, we asked for it to be turned off, and it was, which was nice of the staff. After a couple of days, they started turning it off as soon as we sat down, without us asking, which was sweet.As others have said, wifi is a bit hit and miss and only really strong in the lobby area. However, at least there are some seats in the lobby so you can chill out there for a while and catch up on emails etc.The only downside is that we spent way too much money v's our budget here, but that's not the hotel's fault, and compared to European prices it is very good value for money."

First the manager and driver picked us up from the airport. Our garden/swimmingpool/sea view room was very clean with wonderfull kingsize bed, bathrope and slippers, coffee/tea, tv and safe. The bathroom is super with a stone sink and double shower a normal and rainshower with big soft towels. We enjoyed our 4 night stay very much due to the always helpfull manager Mr Ignasius and his staff , they are so kind and friendly , Mr Ignatius helped us with booking the Rinca boat tour, the Flores over land tour and flight tickets to Lombok, very very nice and accurate ! Thank you for that Mr Ignatius!! The swimmingpool with very clean water was marvelous and you can see a beautiful sunset at the frontbeach. The outdoor restaurant is improving, an extension at the outdoor kitchen is in progress. There are some problems with the WiFi but also this is in progress for improvement. We like to give this hotel and the staff a big 5 star."

","Great hotel, amazing staff, beautiful rooms and surroundings","We stayed at this hotel as a part of a tour (Golo Hilltop Tours), but decided to return later as we really enjoyed our stay there.The rooms were great and had all that we needed. Beds were very comfortable, the room was spacious, and the bathroom was clean and the shower was nice. No complaints as to the interior.The hotel is located on the outskirts of Labuan Bajo (around 10 minutes drive by car), but the hotel offers free transportation service with great drivers who can take you anywhere and assist you in finding/buying whatever you want.The beach is literally just next to the hotels pool and restaurant area, and we didn't see anyone trying to sell us stuff.The restaurant was decent, but nothing out of the ordinary. The breakfast is a buffet, and compared to the indonesian standard, it was good. We could choose between bacon, eggs, toast, fried noodles, cereal, and fruit.Lunch and dinner is decent, but maybe a bit over-priced compared to the quality. The tenderloin steak seemed a good idea on the menu, but not recommendable for the 85.000rp (before tax) price. Instead we recommend the other restaurants in central Labuan Bajo. A good alternative is MadeInItaly which serves excellent pizzas and other italian dishes (prices are above average, but probably worth it).While the price might be above average, the free transportation service made it worth the money in our case. You can call and be picked up within 20 minutes, and they will drive you anywhere within reasonable distance. One of the drivers even helped us book ferry tickets to Makassar and go to a local market and buy bananas. For the price, it is a really good place, and we would definitely recommend it. If we come back to Labuan Bajo, we would most likely revisit Luwansa."

","Amazing staff, good hotel","Pros: The staff was awesome. Ferdi, his cell 03852443677, is the manager and speaks English well. Boni was one of the day drivers and also speaks English well. We called the day before coming and had them set up a boat tour for us which turned out to be excellent. They were waiting at the airport for us, even with our flight being an hour late. They dropped us off at the pier for our tour and gave us towels which was great thinking ahead because we didn't ask for theme but definitely needed them. They took our baggage to the hotel. The tour(don't know the tour boat owner) cost $150 which included a double decker boat- if you can afford it get it, much smoother, comfortable, and quiter on the second deck - and included 2 snorkeling spots, which weren't very good - the water was nice and ear but nothing really to see, Rinca island, and then the sunset fruit bar watching. We cut the last snorkeling short and went to the village on Rinca which was entertaining because if the kids, they were very photogenic and playful. After the tour they picked us up at the pier. We went to the room and when my wife went to shower the hot water didn't work. After calling they had staff in our room in 5 min and had it fixed very fast. The next day Boni drove us around for about 2 hours while we went to different airlines trying to make plans to get to Moni. All the transportation they provided was free plus tip of course. Boni even retraced our route to find my iPad which I left behind. Also, the breakfast was good, nothing special but it was included and was a buffet so it was easy to get up and go eat and then begin the day. The pool was nice, too.We stayed in Rinca 5 which was nice and comfortable with a semi outdoor bathroom. No tub but a nice rainfall shower head.Cons: the wifi isn't available in the room and doesn't work well in the lobby but I had bought a SIM card and minutes, about $15USD, in Bali so I just used that. If you have an iPhone you can use the hotspot for free so you can use your iPad or laptop with it. "

","Nice hotel","We stayed 4 days at Luwansa and enjoyed our stay in the villa room. The villa had a great view was very clean and comfortable with nice daily servicing. The internet does not work most of the time and the breakfast and food in the restaurant is poor. However, the pool is great and the free shuttle service in and out of town extremely convenient. Good price for what you get since flores is relatively expensive compared to bali and lombok, would recommend!"

","One of my favorites in Indonesia","I loved our whole experience at this hotel. The staff here was amazing. They were extremely helpful with all our questions and requests and even provided transportation to and from the airport and to all of the activities we wanted to do in the area (cave, trips into town, our Rinca cruise). However, I wouldn't have needed to even do those things -- I would have been very content to spend a day or two at this hotel's pool and private beach. Our room (one of the ""villas"") was spacious, clean, cool (air conditioned), and the bed was very comfortable. We had a beautiful view and sliding glass doors to go outdoors. The outdoor dining area was lovely and our food was delicious. The pool and beach were amazing, including the bioluminescent beach (go to the beach at night and watch the sparkles when you splash the water). Wonderful choice of place to stay in Labuan Bajo."

","Amazing price for quality","When We got there, we could not belief what we got for the price we paie. Huge room, very clean, a big swimming pool, and a private beach.... The free pick up is also a plus, they come in less than five minute if you call them from town. Dinner is quite good, although a bit more (reasonably) lore expensive than downtown. The breakfast is really ok, exept that the starting tile fluctuates between 6:15 and 7. This is quite annoying whan you have to go diving or go catch your plane. This would be our main critisism. Friendliness off staff widely compensated.Wifi is free only in the lobby, and quite slow, but works.Overal, one of our top 3 price for quality hotel after 6 months of travelling in asia."

","Way to expensive for what they offer","We decided to go for the expensive private bungalows as they advertise on booking.com...it was not a bungalow, they call it villa, and is not a villa. It is just the room facing the sea.The room itself is ok, quite big and with a big bathroom.In the bathroom the sealing had an open spot maybe for some work try did previously, an the grille that separates the window was all broken allowing animals inside the room.I don't mind all those things, but if you book in a 4 star you expect a few attention to details.Breakfast is ok, in line with every other place, near the pool and the beach which are quite nice.Over all it was a good stay, but I don't see the reason for those high price!The shuttle service is really good and fast!"

","Delightful stay at the Luwansa Beach Hotel","W stayed at the Luwansa Beach Hotel for 2 days before going to our Lombok targeted Rinca cruise. The staff at the hotel was extremly friendly and helpful. After two weeks in the south of Bali with it's business and everyone wants to sell you something all the time, our experience in Labuan Bajo was the oposite. The hotel staff informed us what to do around the town, offered us free rides with the shuttle to town and the sites and we had some nice conversations with the personal. The rooms were clean and the food was great. If you're used to alcohol, I would recommend the komodo attacks cocktail..kind of an alternative creation of a long island ice tea.Definitely a excellent place to stay during your Labuan Bajo journey!"

","Good potential","We spent one night after our Komodo trip. The hotel is a bit out of town on the beach. The room was lovely for Flores, this is not Bali,Phuket or Hawaii. The food was good in the restaurant, but the service was horrible. 25 minutes for French fries and chicken wings. The hotel also has Internet speeds from the 1980's and no wifi in rooms. They do have a shuttle to town and airport that makes it very convenient to activites and restaurants.They have flat screen TV in the room but only Indonesian stations. It's only open 8 months so perhaps they will get their act together and wifi the whole hotel at 2014 speed, get some intl stations on TV and seriously train their restaurant staff."

","Quite a surprise!","We ( me and my wife) stayed at this place for a night on 7th April, 2014. We actually booked 2N/3D boat trip to go to Komodo Island. On the second night, we decided to go a hotel instead of the boat which was very basic and claustrophobic. Our tour agent, Jeffrey Buana booked this hotel for us. For a remote place like Labuan Bajo, our expectations were minimal. But this hotel turned out to be one big surprise! The room, a lavish bath room, and the full size windows facing the sea were quite comfortable and very modern. We had dinner and breakfast at this place. They provided us vegetarian food during dinner which was quite delicious. The breakfast was very basic and no options. The room service was excellent and prompt. Overall, a nice small hotel really infornt of the sea! and morning walks along the sea was very refreshing! Will definitely recommend this property."

","Very friendly place","I stayed here with a friend while we planned our trip to Komodo. The rooms were nice and clean and the staff are very helpful. The hotel is located about 6km out of Labuan Bajo, but the Hotel shuttle bus made coming and going very easy. It was just a matter of going to the front desk and asking for a lift and then ringing the hotel to be picked up from town. There appeared to be only two vehicles, so during peak season there may be a wait if there are lots of people using this service. The restaurant is basic. It is a open air restaurant down by the beach, if the weather is anything but perfect the restaurant may not be ideal. The restaurant also has stiff competition with local restaurants in town. We also found a lot of the menu items were not currently being served. This may have been due to us traveling in off-peak season, but we also found this to be the case with a lot of other places in Indonesia.I would still recommend this place due to the value."

","This hotel simply does not have ""it""","If you have the choice, rather go to Golo Hill top hotel in Labuan Bajo. We came at Luwansa due to administrative mistake with our booking at Golo Hill Top, and we really regretted our move.Yes the hotel has a beach, a pool, a restaurant and an airy and spacious reception area. Free shuttle to and fro Labuan town. The only thing I liked about this hotel was the bed as this was not too firm. But the water in the pool was too dirty to even consider using it, there are not enough chairs and parasols around the pool for the number of guests. The food in the restaurant is ridiculously expensive and the quality of the food is just bad. The atmosphere may be attractive to visitors from Eastern Europe, it's not for Western Europeans. There's a lot of bare concrete, the garden is uninspired, missed opportunity by systematically not having balconies. It is as if the hotel owner does not really understand what visitors want and just copy-pasted some impressions he took elsewhere. The hotel does not have a ""soul""."

","Brilliant and relaxing","I stayed at Luwansa Beach Hotel right after Komodo boat trip and it was the most right place I could even imagine. The hotel is situated in a calm quiet place a bit far from the Labuan Bajo center (in terms of walking distance and road conditions), but they have a unique offer (among of neighbours) of transfer to the LB center and backwards by call, so the distance ""from the crowd"" was a real 100% advantage.The room was, I would say, the best option I could expect in terms of value for money. Great stuff, which could do their best even when the conversation in English was a bit difficult. Thanks to all those people!"

","Small rooms, poor maintenance/housekeeping, pity because it's a decent beachside property","My group and I stayed here during a 6-day scuba diving trip. We were upgraded to a ""villa"" room (except for one room, which was strange, why not upgrade everyone?). The standard room that didn't get upgraded was in the main building; the room was very small, not much space to move around when we have our dive gear all unpacked for drying. My friends were trying to dry their dive gear on the balcony (which can be seen from the road), and the staff tried to tell them to bring the gear inside as they are very ""unsightly"". We just ignored them; we paid for the room, so why shouldn't we use the space we paid for?The ""villa"" room was just slightly bigger, but has a balcony overlooking the beach so we had more space for drying stuff. I realize the resort was not set up as a dive resort, so they have no equipment washing area or a lockable shed, so we had to make do with whatever is in our room. That said, it was very inconveniently designed/equipped as a beach resort. There was no outside towel rails (which I would expect in a beach resort), the bathroom is across the room from the front door/balcony door, so if we're dripping wet the entire floor would be (was) soaked. Housekeeping was lackluster, there was a dead bug on the floor when we woke up in the morning, and when we came back in the evening it was still there, swarmed by ants. Towels were not changed if we didn't put it on the floor; if this was some sort of an environmentally friendly move, there should have been a note that tells us about it. We also had a problem with our airconditioning, it was not cold. Despite of informing multiple staff members since day 2, it only got fixed on day 5, a day before we were due to leave. Reception staff was the saving grace of this resort. The lovely girl at reception arranged for massages in our room when available, and at a spa in town. The free transport to town was great even though it gets a bit congested at night when there's only one van/driver on duty.The resort itself is a good-looking beach property, with well-manicured grounds and expansive lawns (which is weird, they have so much acreage, why not make the rooms bigger?). The pool area was great for chilling out after a day of diving, the beach is lovely, and we were endlessly entertained by the cows that came by to graze on the resort's plants and drink the pool water.Breakfast was consistently average (veering towards bad), but if you stick to buttered toasts you'll survive. The restaurant food was slightly better than breakfast, but stupidly expensive. Go to town for better food at lower prices.I don't think I'll be back."

","Lovely getaway","We were here as a group for a few nights in May as part of a driving trip to Komodo National Park. Overall the place is lovely. Only hotel in the area with it's own beach too. The pool is right on the beach, so it makes for some stunning sunsets as you are having a drink in the pool. The room was very comfortable, nice size, overall the hotel was new, so everything was in good condition. The staff were cleaning everywhere non stop. The staff overall were extremely helpful and friendly. They would go all out to help you any way they can. They drove us to our boat and back every day, and to dinner and shopping trips. Lovely service. Main negative is the food. I must say it's pretty awful! If you order form a menue for dinner or snacks, pretty much don't even try - they either don't have the ingredients or don't know how to cook it. The breakfast selection was ok, you could go for European breakfast - which took a very very very long time to arrive, or an Indonesian version, which was really poor quality - think instant noodles. The pool is very shallow, which is a little bit of a shame. However overall, really great place to stay and I would come back in a heartbeat."

","Perfect","Maybe because it is low season and these days were no turists this hotel offered me the very good price (when I came from airport directly) much lower than real one offered by internet. This hotel is perfect. It is new and some things are still new: no many vegetation in the park, but it promises. The room perfect (the price is doble than very budget hotel, but it is worth it), and it is beach resort, clean, modern. Personal staff very pleasent, friendly (expecially Mr. Budy), breakfast excellent. Although is far from the center this resort has FREE ride anywhere you want in town and aeroport. Also if you call them anytime they will come to pick you up. Labuan Bajo is not picturesc town, it is ugly point to the beutifull beaches and there is no anything to do in this city. It has some restaurants but you can not stay in the city (no walking street). That is why this resorts is good for the people that want to stay couple of days: has a swimming pool, bar, etc. No noise, but there is nothing around the resort."

","Beautiful location","Me and my wife were only on Flores Island for 1 night and we stayed at Luwansa Beach Resort. We hadn't pre-booked. We simply landed at the airport, and caught a 'taxi' straight to it (it was advertised in the airport), which took about 5/10 mins.The location of the hotel is almost untouched. It had only opened a few months before, and there are signs of this (grass hasn't yet grown in the intended parts, the grounds are not well lit etc), but you can tell that given a bit of time...the hotel has the potential to be amazing. The room was clean and spacious, and the staff were friendly. The meal we ate there was average, and the fact it was so quiet there (people wise) made it seem a bit eerie on the night, but like I said...it hadn't long opened and Labuan Bajo is still only a tourist attraction in development. In 20 years I'd imagine the place to be full of luxury hotels and bars etc. All in all we had a comfortable stay and I'd recommend it for short term stop-overs. It's located close to Labuan Bajo harbour, making it ideal for linking Rinca and Komodo Island trips."

","Brand new property. Great potential - but needs some work","Just opened a few weeks ago. Felt like a 'soft' opening. Several things good and a few things missed the mark - but could be sorting out the joys of a new business. Room quality was overall very good. Bed, decor - excellent. Bathroom - top quality, super shower, bright with large windows to the ceiling; downside - no window coverings. So no relief from the hot sun and 'full monty' for all those who cared to look up from the pool. Pool was great, bar area was also very good. Needed some umbrellas out by the pool. Landscaping still being done, but should look excellent in a few weeks/months. Beach area - not great, but being worked on. Lunch was good (stick to local offerings, not the western fare). American Breakfast was not good. Again, stick with the indonesian version. Service at Luwansa was outstanding. Attentive and responsive staff; huge smiles; address you by name; willing to help you enjoy your stay in Bajo. In fact, the GM gave us a lift into town one night. Very kind and gracious host. In our opinion, a 3 for now, but only has to make a few adjustments to get to 4++."

","Golo Hilltop hotel and boat trip.","We took a 3 night package deal with the hotel which included the 1st night there, room were great and very clean with nice linen, bathroom was great with hot water and all the extras, aircon was great and the view was stunning, as the name says they are on a hill - we chose a top deluxe room which was a bit of a climb for us (in mid 70's) but worth it when you got to the top for the view of some of the surrounding islands, it was a short walk to the town which is still unspoiled by tourism - this will change as the airport has been declared an international now. the 2nd day we were picked up at 7am and taken to the boat for an all day and then overnight and until 4pm next day, this was fantastic, the crew were all great and smiling and the food cooked on the boat was great and authentic and HOT (heat hot) The cabins and shower were very basic but clean, we had a bit of a problem getting into the bunks and myself getting on and off the boat, but the crew were very helpful with this. We had a 2 hour sail through many of the islands, we were lucky, the weather was perfect for sailing, we had a few hours on Rinja to see the Komodo dragons and have a bit of a trek through the bush, there re a lot around the kitchen area, but they do not feed them, we saw a couple in the wild, also the odd wild pig and deer. We had a guide with a pole in case they got too close and then there were a couple of bouts of snorkelling for my husband and my daughter, they enjoyed that, one of the boys threw some chicken skin in the water and the fish all came up to the surface, the colours were beautiful. A highlight was a big fish swimming around the boat which the boys threw a hand line into the water and took about half an hour to land it - it was a 20kg trevally which they kept watered and would sell at the market when they got back to Flores. We visited Komoda the next day and was much the same as Rinja, there were 3 different length of treks and we opted for the middle ones - around 2 hours. We also got to see the manta rays and the fruitbats in their thousands. It was well worth the trip and too much to put into a review, so if anyone wants any more information they can contact us and we will be pleased to reply. I would certainly recommend the hotel."

","a lovely, cheap place to stay","We stayed here 2 nights. The luxury rooms are at the top and not for feeble climbers. My husband would have been better in the standard room, but he managed.The views are beautiful and so the sunset. Dinner was local Indo food, but good.It is a bit of a way up the hill from the city centre. The walk down is OK, but getting back a lot harder and hot. Just hail a local on a motor bike ad for $5 for 2 pers, they will take you up or down. Sometimes we told them when we would head back, arranged to meet, and got both ways for the one $5."

","Loved it!","What a great place! All the bungalows have verandas with great views. The rooms are super clean. Room safe and fridge. The pool is lovely. Gardens are beautiful. Service is excellent. We went into town for most meals using local transportation. Book in advance to avoid disappointment."
